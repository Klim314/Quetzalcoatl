TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent Gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - Twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. All the compounds had MICs between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. In order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) at MICs of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at MICs of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and MDR-MRSA at MIC of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. Finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. The majority of cells in biofilm populations of MSSA and MRSA were eradicated at low level of 3, with MBICs in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
TI  - Ophthalmic infections in children presenting to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ophthalmic infections cause significant morbidity in Cambodian children but aetiologic data are scarce. We investigated the causes of acute eye infections in 54 children presenting to the ophthalmology clinic at Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap between March and October 2012. FINDINGS: The median age at presentation was 3.6 years (range 6 days - 16.0 years). Forty two patients (77.8%) were classified as having an external eye infection, ten (18.5%) as ophthalmia neonatorum, and two (3.7%) as intra-ocular infection. Organisms were identified in all ophthalmia neonatorum patients and 85.7% of patients with an external eye infection. Pathogens were not detected in either of the intra-ocular infection patients. Most commonly isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13), coliforms (7), Haemophilus influenzae/parainfluenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2). Chlamydia trachomatis DNA was detected in 60% of swabs taken from ophthalmia neonatorum cases. CONCLUSIONS: This small study demonstrates the wide range of pathogens associated with common eye infections in Cambodian children. The inclusion of molecular assays improved the spectrum of detectable pathogens, most notably in neonates.
TI  - Temperate pyomyositis: a pain in the belly.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a rare disease in temperate climates. This case is a unique presentation of pyomyositis of the rectus abdominal muscle mimicking an acute abdominal process. Most reported cases of pyomyositis are of extremity infections with Staphylococcus aureus.This report presents a case of polymicrobial pyomyositis from Haemophylus parainfluenza and Steptococcus viridians infection.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis caused by Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  - Bacterial pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics. Purulent pericarditis is most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. The number of H. parainfluenzae infections has been increasing; in rare cases, it has caused endocarditis. We report a case of purulent pericarditis caused by H. parainfluenzae in a 62-year-old woman who reported a recent upper respiratory tract infection. The patient presented with signs and symptoms of pericardial tamponade. Urgent pericardiocentesis restored her hemodynamic stability. However, within 24 hours, fluid reaccumulation led to recurrent pericardial tamponade and necessitated the creation of a pericardial window. Cultures of the first pericardial fluid grew H. parainfluenzae. Levofloxacin therapy was started, and the patient recovered. Haemophilus parainfluenzae should be considered in a patient who has signs and symptoms of purulent pericarditis. Prompt diagnosis, treatment, and antibiotic therapy are necessary for the patient's survival. To our knowledge, this is the first report of purulent pericarditis caused by H. parainfluenzae.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint: an uncommon location.
AB  - Septic pyogenic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a rare entity that occurs in immunosuppressed patients or those with discontinuity of defense barriers. There are only 15 cases described in the literature. The diagnosis is based on clinical features and the isolation of a microorganism in synovial fluid or blood cultures. The evidence of arthritis by imaging (MRI, ultrasound or scintigraphy) may be useful. Antibiotic treatment is the same as in septic arthritis in other locations. Staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most frequently isolated. Our objective was to describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint at a Rheumatology Department. We developed a study with a retrospective design (1989-2012). The medical records of patients with septic arthritis were reviewed (101 patients). Those involving the acromioclavicular joint were selected (6 patients; 6%).
TI  - Ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. Empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from January 2001 to December 2010 were examined. Specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. Only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised Staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). Fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results, knowledge of the initial Gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a simple Gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.
TI  - Induced sputum compared to bronchoalveolar lavage in young, non-expectorating cystic fibrosis children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Induced sputum (IS) is feasible and safe in young CF children and is  a readily accessible, non-invasive technique. However, it has not been compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the gold standard for diagnosing lower airway infection. METHODS: We compared bacterial yield from IS and BAL in 11 non-expectorating CF children, aged 3 to 7.4 years. IS samples were obtained in 10/11 cases. RESULTS: Eight out of ten had the same predominant bacteria cultured from IS and BAL: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia[1], Staphylococcus aureus[3], and upper respiratory tract flora [4]. In one, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were cultured from IS alone, whereas in one, non-group B Haemophilus influenzae was cultured from BAL alone. CONCLUSIONS: As proof of principle, IS samples showed good bacteriologic correlation with BAL. Larger studies are recommended to confirm IS as a clinically valuable tool and measure for early intervention studies in young CF children.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Gram-negative organisms, including wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. A total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from SSTI and 1251 from CARTI, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 AWARE ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL; 93.4% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/mL; 80.6% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL) than penicillin (MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL). Similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL) and Klebsiella spp. (MIC50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/mL) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an ESBL phenotype in the region, particularly in China. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/mL; 99.8% susceptible by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] criteria), and it was also highly potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/mL; 100% susceptible by CLSI criteria). Ceftaroline was also active against H. parainfluenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/mL) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with SSTI and CARTI from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and other skin and soft tissue infections among basic military trainees, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, 2008-2012.
AB  - Military training environments have been identified as high-risk settings for acquisition of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among the 148,355 basic military trainees at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2012, there were 289 SSTIs, including 48 cases of culture-confirmed MRSA and 48 cases of possible MRSA-defined as SSTIs treated with both incision and drainage and MRSA drug coverage (i.e., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, a tetracycline, or linezolid). The period prevalence rates of all SSTIs and MRSA SSTIs increased annually since fiscal year 2010. Of the 87 SSTIs cultured during the surveillance period, 74 were positive: MRSA (n=48); methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n=24); Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n=1); and viridans Streptococcus (n=1). Among MRSA positive cultures, three were resistant to clindamycin, one to tetracycline, and one to both clindamycin and tetracycline; none was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. An algorithmic clinical approach and heightened public health measures may reduce rates of future SSTIs among basic trainees at Lackland Air Force Base.
TI  - Bacteria and Candida yeasts in inflammations of the oral mucosa in children with  secondary immunodeficiency.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral microbial flora and a damaged oral mucosa may increase the risk  of bacteriemia, fungemia and complications in immunocompromised patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: Assessment of presence: bacteria and Candida spp. in different oral lesions, and the incidence of bacteremia in the case of a damaged mucosa in transplant recipients and patients receiving anti-tumour chemotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Forty-five patients - 18 months to 18 years of life, were included (20 - organ recipients, 14- anti-tumour chemotherapy, 11 - control group). Clinical, oral mucosa examination focused on the type, severity and site of lesions, and microbiology assessed the presence of bacteria and fungi in the material from lesions. Blood cultures were performed in ten immunocompromised patients with manifestations of systemic infection. The control material consisted of blood cultures made prior to the onset of oral lesions and after 4-6 weeks following their remission in a diagnosed bacteremia. The statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the subjects with secondary immunodeficiency, among other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Candidia spp. were more frequent. In cancer patients, mucositis was associated with Candida spp., Streptococcus spp. Organ recipients with stomatitis exhibited the presence of CoNS, Streptococcus viridians and other. Oral lesions in the control group contained Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. In 30% of immunocompromised patients, oral lesions were accompanied by bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation has been found between oral lesions and the presence of S. aureus in patients without secondary immunodeficiency, and of CoNS, Enterococcus spp., Candida spp. in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in children without underlying heart disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although pre-existing heart disease is the main predisposing  factor for pediatric infective endocarditis (IE), cases of IE in children without underlying heart disease have been increasingly reported. This study reviews the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric IE patients with and without underlying heart disease, and presents the unique features of patients with no apparent pre-existing heart disease. METHODS: Children who were admitted to our hospital from January 1991 to April 2011 and met the Modified Duke criteria for definite or possible IE were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected by chart review. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with a total of 48 episodes of IE were enrolled. Of these patients, 31 children (64.6%) had congenital heart disease (CHD), six (12.5%) had non-CHD chronic disease, and eleven (22.9%) were previously healthy adolescents. Five patients with non-CHD chronic conditions acquired infection from central catheter: two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), two Candida albicans and one coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS). The microbial pathogens in 11 previously healthy individuals were Streptococcus viridans (n = 3), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA, n = 2), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), Enterococcus (n = 1), and Diphtheroid (n = 1). In total, five of 17 non-CHD patients were infected with S. aureus (two MRSA and three MSSA) and the vegetations in these five patients were detected in the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve or right atrium). The average interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of IE in the CHD and previously healthy groups was 18 and 31 days, respectively. Patients in the previously healthy group were older and more often required surgical interventions for removal of vegetation. CONCLUSION: Over one-third (35.4%) of cases of IE in children occurred in patients without pre-existing cardiac disease. Early identification of these patients is critical and requires a high index of suspicion. The pathogenesis of IE in previously healthy individuals is still uncertain, but previous skin infection or dental problems may contribute to potential risk.
TI  - Maintenance treatment with inhaled ampicillin in patients with cystic fibrosis and lung infection due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Surgical site infections after gracilis free flap reconstruction for facial paralysis.
AB  - Compared with other free tissue transfer procedures, the gracilis free muscle transfer (GFMT) for facial reanimation is unique in that the recipient site is typically uninvolved by malignancy or infection. In this study, the authors examined the incidence, bacteriology, and outcomes of surgical site infection (SSI) after gracilis free muscle transfer for facial reanimation. From 2003 to 2011, 105 patients underwent 107 GFMT operations, with 6 SSIs. All cases of infection occurred in patients receiving clindamycin, levofloxacin, and/or cefazolin perioperatively. None of the patients who received ampicillin-sulbactam developed an SSI. Surgical site cultures grew oral flora, including alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Fusobacterium and Neisseria species, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Notably, there were no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. These data may have implications for the optimal perioperative antibiotic choice in facial reanimation cases. Further study is needed to determine the ideal antibiotic regimen for this category of free flap surgeries.
TI  - Summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the United States, 2010: report from the Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) surveillance program.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. In the United States, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). All organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055 (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. The MIC(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. All staphylococcus isolates (S. aureus and CoNS) were inhibited at ceftaroline MIC values of </= 2 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; MIC(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). Potent activity was also shown against Gram-negative pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Furthermore, wild-type strains of Enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing strains and non-AmpC-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. Continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.
TI  - [The role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Approximately half of COPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. Current guidelines recommend antibotic therapy in course of COPD exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated in COPD exacerbation are Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. More virulent organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. Atypical pathogens such Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. Rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of COPD exacerbation has been described in the article.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - [Drug susceptibility of Haemophilus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus strains colonizing respiratory tract in children with mucoviscidosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our studies was to isolate haemophili rods and S. aureus from children with mucoviscidosis and to assess antimicrobial agent susceptibility of the isolates. METHODS: Sputa and nasopharynx swabs from 12 children with mucoviscidosis were screened for the prevalence ofHaemophilus sp. and S. aureus. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was performed by agar diffusion method using appropriate media. Beta-lactamase activity was determined with the nitrocefin discs, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance using D-test. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: Of 12 mucoviscidosis-positive patients, 7 (58.33%) were colonisated by haemophili rods (a total of 8 H. parainfluenzae, 2 H. influenzae or 2 Haemophilus sp. isolates) and by S. aureus (8 isolates), in these species were isolated alone or in mixed cultures. Two ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus sp. but without beta-lactamases production were obtained. Also two methicillin resistant S. aureus with constitutive phenotype of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins B isolates and two methicillin-sensitive (with constitutive and inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins B) were isolated.
TI  - Patterns and dynamics of airway colonisation in mechanically-ventilated patients.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and dynamics of the microbiota in the airways of ventilated patients. Seventy-four mechanically-ventilated patients were recruited consecutively, and oropharyngeal, tracheal and bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid specimens were collected 48 h after intubation, and every 72 h thereafter until the patient was extubated or a total of five sample sets had been collected. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) pathogens were identified, quantified and genotyped. Microbial findings were highly correlated both between airway locations and over time when samples were taken no more than 72 h apart. If no VAP pathogen was present in the oral flora, it was unlikely to be found in a lower airway sample; i.e., the positive predictive value of the oropharyngeal sample was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67-0.80), and the negative predictive value was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.99). Colonisation with Enterobacteriacae, non-fermentative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus was monoclonal in the airways and over time, whereas colonisation with microbes normally found in the oropharynx, i.e., Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, was polyclonal. When antibiotics were used, the chance of recovering VAP pathogens from all sampling sites was reduced three-fold. No correlation was observed between a bacterial count of > or =10(4) CFU/mL in BAL fluid and chest X-rays compatible with VAP.
TI  - [A case of pulmonary abscess in which Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus intermedius were isolated by percutaneous needle aspiration].
AB  - Some microbes, including the Bacteroides species, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus milleri groups, can cause pulmonary abscess. Haemophilus parainfluenzae is usually categorized as one of the normal flora which colonizes in the ears and the nasopharynx, and it has been long considered that H. parainfluenzae has little pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract and lung parenchymal. In this report, we present a case of pulmonary abscess caused by both H. parainfluenzae and Streptococcus intermedius. The patient was a 75-year-old man who had had total esophageo-gastrectomy because of esophageal cancer. He presented with purulent sputum, and chest X-ray film showed a dense consolidation in the right upper lung field. CT-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. Since both H. parainfluenzae and S. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. The patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray film improved thereafter. So far, very few cases have been reported in which H. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. Although S. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that H. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - Emergence and persistence of macrolide resistance in oropharyngeal flora and elimination of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus after therapy with slow-release clarithromycin: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - To investigate the effect of slow-release (SR) clarithromycin on colonization and the development of resistance in oropharyngeal and nasal flora, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 8 weeks of follow-up. A total of 296 patients with documented coronary artery disease were randomized in the preoperative outpatient clinic to receive a daily dose of SR clarithromycin (500 mg) (CL group) or placebo tablets (PB group) until the day of surgery. Nose and throat swabs were taken before the start of therapy, directly after the end of therapy, and 8 weeks later. The presence of potential pathogenic bacteria was determined, and if they were isolated, MIC testing was performed. Quantitative culture on media with and without macrolides was performed for the indigenous oropharyngeal flora. In addition, analysis of the mechanism of resistance was performed with the macrolide-resistant indigenous flora. Basic patient characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups. The average number of tablets taken was 15 (standard deviation = 6.4). From the throat swabs, Haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated and carriage was not affected in either of the treatment groups. Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, however, was significantly reduced in the CL group (from 35.3 to 4.3%) compared to the PB group (from 32.4 to 30.3%) (P < 0.0001; relative risk [RR], 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 16.0). Resistance to clarithromycin was present significantly more frequently in H. parainfluenzae in the CL group after treatment (P = 0.007; RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3); also, the percentage of patients with resistance to macrolides in the indigenous flora after treatment was significantly higher in the CL group (31 to 69%) (P < 0.0001; RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.5). This persisted for at least 8 weeks. This study shows that besides the effective elimination of nasal carriage of S. aureus, treatment with SR clarithromycin for approximately 2 weeks has a marked and sustained effect on the development of resistance in the oropharyngeal flora for at least 8 weeks.
TI  - Microbial etiologies in community acquired pneumonia (CAP).
AB  - The objective of the study was determination of bacterial etiologic factors, including antibiotic atypical pathogens, of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and of sensitivity of isolated strains. The examined group comprised 50 patients with clinical and x-ray image of pneumonia. Patients' expectoration sputum was analyzed. Amongst all isolated bacteria, the most frequent were Staphylococcus aureus - 17.9%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae - 12.5% and H. influenzae - 8.9%. Identification of Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum in 8.9% of CAP cases drew our particular attention. Staphylococcus aureus was the least antibiotic sensitive microorganism. In the majority of patients (26: 52%), serologic markers of chlamydial infection were determined. Pneumonia often results from mixed typical and atypical flora infection. High percentage of atypical pathogens in the examined material suggests the necessity to administer intracellularly acting antibiotics.
TI  - Etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections in Japanese children.
AB  - To investigate the etiology of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, we conducted a prospective, population-based study covering the total population < 15 years of age in 16 municipalities in Hokkaido, Japan, during the period of April 2000 to March 2001. Chest radiographs were available for all cases (n = 921; 398 as pneumonia and 523 as bronchitis) and paired sera for serologic assays were available for more than half of the cases. The following specimens were also collected: nasopharyngeal swabs for viral, bacteriological, mycoplasmal and chlamydial studies, blood for serology and blood culture. The children were then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Specific infecting organisms were identified in a total of 853 (92.6%) out of 921 patients (398 cases of pneumonia and 523 cases of bronchitis) including 205 with mixed infection as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 252 (274%) patients; respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, 188 (20.4%); influenza A virus, 110 (11.9%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 95 (10.3%); Haemophilus influenzae, 90 (9.8%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 35 (3.8%); Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (3.1%); adenovirus, 27 (2.9%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (1.3%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 7 (0.8%); Chlamydia pneumoniae, 6 (0.7%); and other agents, 2 (0.2%). Mycoplasma infections were seen even in patients less than 5 years and RS and influenza A virus infections in patients more than 5 years of age. The importance of M. pneumoniae and RS virus in the etiology of lower respiratory infections in Japanese children was confirmed.
TI  - Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. Recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (ER) tablets (Augmentin XR, GlaxoSmithKline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. The bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. In clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), amoxicillin/clavulanate ER was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be generally well tolerated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate ER is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with ABS or CAP caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - This study compared the in vitro activity of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against 381 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 320 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 54.6% of the isolates. The ertapenem MIC was < or =2 mg/L for 98.4% of isolates and > or =8 mg/L for 1.0% (all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem had the most potent activity against Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and its activity against H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, all strains of which were susceptible, was not altered by beta-lactamase production. Only one S. pneumoniae strain, a penicillin-resistant isolate, was resistant to ertapenem. Ertapenem was highly active in vitro against pyogenic bacteria recovered from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Oral bacteria influenced by the functional status of the elderly people and the type and quality of facilities for the bedridden.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the relationship between oral bacteria and the health and functional status of the elderly. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteria species in the oral cavity of the elderly were examined. It was found that the bedridden subjects staying at two hospitals for long-term (HOBR) showed significantly lower detection rates of commensal bacteria species and significantly higher detection rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and of coagulase(-) Staph. aureus than those living independently (the independent). In addition, the detection rate of Haemophilus parainfluenzae in NUBR was discovered to be higher than that found in the independent. In HOBR, the detection rate of Ps. aeruginosa was significantly higher among in-patients who required continual care than those in need of partial care, while the detection rate of MRSA was significantly higher among in-patients with low serum albumin than those with normal serum albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Oral bacteria examination analysis proved that the risks of infection of some pathogenic bacteria species were correlated with functional status, physical function and nutritional state. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study suggests that the oral bacteria, especially pathogenic bacteria were influenced by the functional status of the elderly and the type and quality of the facilities for the bedridden, physical function and nutritional state.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - An international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. Clinical success rates were maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). The 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating CAP. At follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), Haemophilus influenzae (19%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. The adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. Most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. Study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. In all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of CAP. Bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater than those of clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - A comparison of a five-day regimen of cefdinir with a seven-day regimen of loracarbef for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - To compare the efficacy and safety of five-day cefdinir treatment with seven-day  loracarbef treatment in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, 586 patients were enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial. Patients received either five days of treatment with cefdinir (n = 291) at 300 mg twice daily or seven days of treatment with loracarbef (n = 295) at 400 mg twice daily. Microbiological assessments were done on sputum specimens obtained at admission and at the two post-therapy visits, if available. The clinical cure rates were 86% (138/160) and 85% (141/166) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and loracarbef, respectively. Respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 457 (78%) of 586 admission sputum specimens, with the predominant pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The microbiological eradication rates at the test-of-cure visit were 88% (193/219 pathogens) and 90% (227/251 pathogens) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and loracarbef, respectively. Adverse event rates while on treatment were 30% and 21% for cefdinir- and loracarbef-treated patients, respectively. These results indicate that a five-day regimen of cefdinir is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
TI  - Comparison of a 5 day regimen of cefdinir with a 10 day regimen of cefprozil for  treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with cefdinir 300 mg bd for 5 days or cefprozil 500 mg bd for 10 days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicentre study. Of the 548 patients enrolled, 281 (51%) were evaluable. The clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 80% (114/142) and 72% (100/139) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefprozil, respectively. Respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 409 (75%) of 548 admission sputum specimens, with the predominant pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis. The microbiological eradication rates at the test-of-cure visit were 81% (157 of 193 pathogens) and 84% (166 of 198 pathogens) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefprozil, respectively. Adverse event rates while on treatment were equivalent between the two treatment groups. The incidence of diarrhoea during therapy was higher for patients treated with cefdinir (17%) than for patients treated with cefprozil (6%) (P < 0.01), but most cases were mild and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. These results indicate that a 5 day regimen of cefdinir is as effective and safe in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis as a 10 day regimen of cefprozil.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in Europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  - Although most respiratory tract infections (RTI) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with RTI must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. Europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of S. pneumoniae from France and Spain. Uniquely, in Italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. Resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-Lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. In 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 European countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. The MIC(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of S. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/L, the MICs for only five strains being >2 mg/L, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/L. The MIC(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of H. influenzae and 323 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of M. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/L. The MIC(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila (MIC(90) 0.015 mg/L), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (MICs 0.06-0.12 mg/L). Current susceptibility data indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in European countries. The enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of S. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of RTI.
TI  - Diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome in two sisters.
AB  - Two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO syndrome) are presented. The diagnoses of diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis at the age of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. Because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the sternoclavicular joints with hyperostosis were present, a SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. Microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Veilonella species at the mandible. Repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed over a period of up to 20 years. Since HLA typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind study of short-course (5 day) grepafloxacin versus 10 day clarithromycin in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin were compared with clarithromycin in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of 805 patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). Patients were randomized to receive grepafloxacin 400 mg od for either 5 (n = 273) or 10 days (n = 268) or clarithromycin 250 mg bd for 10 days (n = 261). Patients were assessed pre-treatment, 3-5 days during treatment, 1-3 days post-treatment and at follow-up (21-28 days post-treatment). The clinical success rates for the evaluable patients were 91% in the 5 day grepafloxacin group, 95% in the 10 day grepafloxacin group and 86% in the clarithromycin group. At follow-up, respective rates were 72%, 81% and 73%. A total of 513 pathogens were isolated from the pre-treatment sputum specimens of 400 (49%) patients. The primary pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (36% of isolates), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (27%), Moraxella catarrhalis (12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (3%). Pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated at post-treatment in 85%, 91% and 58% of evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 days, grepafloxacin 10 days and clarithromycin 10 days, respectively. The eradication rates in both grepafloxacin groups were significantly greater than the clarithromycin group (P<0.001). All treatments were well tolerated and incidence of drug-related adverse events in each group was comparable. This study demonstrates that both a 5 and a 10 day regimen of grepafloxacin 400 mg od are as clinically and bacteriologically effective as in the treatment of ABECB clarithromycin 250 mg bd. for 10 days.
TI  - Effectiveness of short-course therapy (5 days) with grepafloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Three hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled in a double-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and safety of a 5-day course (n = 195) versus a 10-day course (n = 194) of grepafloxacin 400 mg once daily in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). Patients in the 5-day treatment group received placebo on days 6 through 10. Bacteriologic assessments were based on cultures of sputum specimens obtained before and, when possible, during and after treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 332 of 388 (86%) patients, the primary pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus (29%, 19%, 4%, 5%, and 5% of isolates, respectively). Among isolates tested for beta-lactamase production, results were positive in 25% of H influenzae isolates and 90% of M catarrhalis isolates. Forty-two percent of S pneumoniae isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility (intermediate or high-level resistance) to penicillin. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 83% (128 of 155) and 81% (122 of 150) of clinically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. Pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated in 77% (106 of 138) and 80% (98 of 123) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. The 2 treatment groups were equivalent with respect to both clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, and no statistically significant differences in the incidence of drug-related adverse events were seen between the 2 groups. Substantial symptom relief was evident with both treatment regimens by the first during-treatment measurement, which occurred between days 3 through 5. These results indicate that treatment with 400 mg grepafloxacin once daily for 5 days is as well tolerated and effective as treatment for 10 days in patients with ABECB. The lower cost compared with a 10-day regimen and the increased likelihood that patients will complete the entire shorter, once-daily regimen make the 5-day grepafloxacin regimen a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of ABECB.
TI  - Etiology, susceptibility, and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of complicated chronic bronchitis in the primary care setting: ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. versus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Bronchitis Study Group.
AB  - Although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) appears beneficial in patients with a history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. In a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) 750 mg and clarithromycin (CLA) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with AECB (1083 CIP, 1097 CLA). Patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe AECB episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for AECB within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. Significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. The majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). Mean patient age was 62 years. A history of at least three AECB episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of CIP-treated patients and 53% of CLA-treated patients. Of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included Haemophilus species, 28%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; Enterobacteriaceae, 18%; Staphylococcus aureus, 17%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. Beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of Haemophilus influenzae, 10% of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of M catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-four percent of S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/L). Among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for CIP versus 90% and 96% for CLA. The differences between CIP and CLA did not reach statistical significance. Superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in CLA-treated (3%) versus CIP-treated patients (1%). Eradication rates for specific organisms for CIP and CLA, respectively, were Haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; M catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; S pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and Enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of CIP-treated patients and 10% of CLA-treated patients. CIP 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than CLA 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe AECB. The causative bacterial pathogens of AECB appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. Thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with AECB should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), a combination drug of piperacillin (PIPC) with the new beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (TAZ), were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. After intravenous administration of TAZ/PIPC at a dose of 25 mg/kg to one child, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 24.4 micrograms/ml and 119 micrograms/ml respectively after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.48 and 0.60 hours respectively. Same as 50 mg/kg to two children, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 17.5, 32.2 micrograms/ml and 92.8, 163 micrograms/ml after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.37, 0.50 hours and 0.51, 0.59 hours. A ratio of TAZ to PIPC was about 1 to 4 in plasma levels. The cumulative urinary recovery rates of TAZ and PIPC in the first 6 hours after intravenous administration were 15.8, 64.9% and 39.8, 53.4%. 2. The antibacterial activity of TAZ/PIPC against clinically isolated organisms was determined. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC were < or = 0.05 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 3. The clinical efficacy of TAZ/PIPC could be evaluated in 14 patients with various bacterial infections, and was evaluated as "excellent" in 9 patients and as "good" in 5. The overall clinical efficacy rate in 14 cases was 100% and excellent was 64.3%. Bacteriological efficacy rate was 91.7% (10/11). 4. As a side effect, loose stool was observed in one case, no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. It has been concluded that TAZ/PIPC was a useful drug in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - Cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  - The orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. Because widespread antibiotic use is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. Using the E-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately 700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. The results demonstrated that > 90% of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of Escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the NCCLS interpretive breakpoints. MIC distributions showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin 600 mg daily for 10 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin in treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was assessed in an open-label, noncomparative study. Patients (N = 273) received grepafloxacin 600 mg QD for 10 days. A total of 237 patients (87%) completed the study. In assessable patients, the clinical success rate at follow-up (4 to 6 weeks after the last dose) was 89% (211/238 patients). In microbiologically assessable patients, the eradication rate at follow-up was 95% (86/91 isolates). Grepafloxacin was highly effective in the treatment of bacterial CAP caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus and in the therapy of atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Grepafloxacin was well tolerated, with the most frequently reported drug-related adverse events being taste perversion and nausea. Grepafloxacin 600 mg QD for 10 days was highly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with CAP.
TI  - In-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - One hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. All isolates, except Rothia spp. (one), Enterococcus avium (three), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. All the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. A potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the MICs of spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of Eubacterium, two of lactobacilli, one strain of Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.
TI  - Rapid, sensitive, microbial detection by gene amplification using restriction endonuclease target sequences.
AB  - The use of primers synthesized to eight class II restriction endonuclease target  sequences, from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella infantis, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Proteus vulgaris for single and multiplex PCR identification of the organisms is discussed. Results indicate that the method is sensitive and specific enough to detect single cells and attogram amounts of target DNA. It has also been demonstrated that the primers can be used in whole cell PCR for identification and whole cell PCR product recovery could be enhanced by the addition of gelatin or DMSO to PCR reaction mixtures. Other results have indicated that the method can be used for the definite identification of specific individuals present in mixed cultures or suspensions of organisms. The applicability of the method for detection of a specific strain within a group of closely related organisms has also been investigated and for that sequence/organism the results suggest that the proposed method is indeed very specific and discriminative. It is suggested that as more information becomes available regarding such sequences and their distribution, this approach could form the basis of a widescale, rapid, simple and cheap identification and/or typing system for bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of cefdinir and cefaclor in treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Six hundred ninety patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of cefdinir with those of cefaclor in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients received either 10 days of treatment with cefdinir (n = 347) at 300 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment with cefaclor (n = 343) at 500 mg three times daily. Microbiological assessments were performed on sputum specimens obtained at admission and at the two posttherapy visits, if available. Respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 538 (78%) of 690 patient admission sputum specimens, with the predominant pathogens being Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The microbiological eradication rates at the test-of-cure visit were 92% (238 of 260 pathogens) and 93% (245 of 264 pathogens) for the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefaclor, respectively. A satisfactory clinical response (cure plus improvement) was achieved in 89% (166 of 187) and 86% (160 of 186) of the evaluable patients treated with cefdinir and cefaclor, respectively. Except for the incidence of diarrhea, adverse event rates while on treatment were equivalent between the two treatment groups. Diarrhea incidence during therapy was higher for patients treated with cefdinir (13.7%) than for patients treated with cefaclor (5.3%). These results indicate that cefdinir is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with pneumonia.
TI  - [Clinical study on azithromycin in 10% fine granules and 100mg capsules in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. The following results were obtained in our studies of AZM for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. MICs of AZM, erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. Among Gram-positive cocci, MICs of AZM ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). These MICs were similar to those of the other macrolides. Among Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of AZM were 0.05 micrograms/ml against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. Against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs of AZM were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. One strain of M. pneumoniae showed tolerance to AZM at MIC 25 micrograms/ml. The other agents exhibited higher MIC than AZM against this organism. 2. Plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. The patients received AZM at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. Drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after Day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. Urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules. Drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. Urinary excretion rates of AZM in three patients on capsules lied in a range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. Effectiveness of AZM in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. AZM was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. Effectiveness of AZM in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. AZM was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. AZM in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. AZM in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. As for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of AZM. One patient on AZM capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. As for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased WBC, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased GOT and GPT, one with increased GPT. They were all on fine granular form of AZM. As far as abnormalities found in patients administered with AZM in capsular form, two showed decreased WBC, one decreased WBC along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.
TI  - [A clinical evaluation of azithromycin in the treatment of pediatric infection].
AB  - Fine granule preparation of azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, was given to treat various infections in pediatric patients. Efficacies of AZM in a total of 21 patients (tonsillitis in six, bronchitis in five, pneumonia in five, impetigo contagiosa in three, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in one and bacterial enterogastritis in one) were rated "excellent" in 11 patients and "good" in eight. The remaining two cases were not included in the evaluation. AZM eradicated all strains of infection-causative bacteria identified in the 21 patients: Staphylococcus aureus in two, Streptococcus pneumoniae in four, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in four, Haemophilus influenzae in six, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in three and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in one. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, while two patients showed increases in eosinophils as abnormal laboratory changes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin using fine granules or capsules in the pediatric patients].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, in fine granules and in capsules  was studied for pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations. 1. Antibacterial activities. MIC profile of AZM was as follows: 0.78 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.10 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.10 approximately 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.39 microgram/ml against Moraxella(Branhamella) catarrhalis, 0.39 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and 0.20 approximately 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 2. Absorption and excretion. The elimination half-life of AZM after its administration at 10 mg/kg/day for three days was 28.1 approximately 46.1 hours. The cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 120 hours after start of treatment was 4.01 approximately 8.47%. 3. Clinical evaluation. AZM was given to 76 pediatric patients to treat following infections: pharyngitis in seven, tonsillitis in 11, bronchitis in 11, pneumonia in 19, Mycoplasma pneumonia in eight, scarlet fever in 13, infective enteritis in one, SSTI in four, and otitis media in two. Effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 75 patients and the drug was rated "excellent" or "good" in 71 resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%, 87.0% of the 46 cases indicated that AZM had eradicated bacteria identified before the treatment. One patient complained of moderate diarrhea which disappeared after treatment of anti-diarrheic. Abnormal laboratory changes were reported in 12 patients in the following: decreased leukocytes in eight, increased eosinophils in two, increased platelet count in one, and increased GPT in one. All cases of abnormality was deemed mild in severity and clinically insignificant.
TI  - A multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the Alexander Project.
AB  - The Alexander Project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. Fifteen centres, ten in the European Union (EU) and five in the USA, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of MICs of 15 antimicrobials using the Sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. Of the total of 6385 isolates collected, Haemophilus influenzae (2718), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and Moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus (690). Haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified less commonly. High-level penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in Germany, Italy, UK and two of the five USA centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in France and Spain. Intermediate penicillin resistance (MIC 0.12-1 mg/L) was identified in 228 isolates of S. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (EU, 0-52.3%; USA, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. Resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of H. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. Rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in Weingarten, Germany in 1993 to 38.5% in Barcelona, Spain in 1992. In general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in USA centres than in those of the EU. beta-Lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of M. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. Virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. Of the 690 collected, most isolates of S. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. Isolates from two centres, Genoa, Italy in 1992 and Paris, France in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). Combined isolates of H. parainfluenzae and K. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. Although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the respiratory tract in children with cystic fibrosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: Pulmonary infections is a main cause of morbimortality in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to know the flora implicated in respiratory pathology of all mucoviscidotic children attending Hospital Sant Joan de Deu of Barcelona. METHODS: Quantitative cultures from respiratory samples (most of them: sputum) of 26 patients were performed from January 91 to June 93. There were 13 girls and 13 boys, aged 1 to 13 years (mean: 7 years). RESULTS: 282 microorganisms were isolated from 203 positive samples. Cultures of 88.4% of patients yielded in some moment Haemophilus influenzae, 82.6% of them Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 65.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38.4% Staphylococcus aureus. The most prevalent microorganism was P. aeruginosa (66%) followed by H. influenzae (29%) and S. aureus (26.6%). 59% of P. aeruginosa strains showed a mucoid phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus sp. causes short term infections that affect children of all ages, whereas infections due to P. aeruginosa persist in spite of correct antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Effectiveness of short-course therapy (5 days) with cefuroxime axetil in treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  - Five hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled in two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and the safety of 5- or 10-day treatment with cefuroxime axetil with those of 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis. Patients received either 5 or 10 days of treatment (n = 177 in each group) with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily or 10 days of treatment (n = 183) with amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily. Patients in the cefuroxime axetil (5 days) group received placebo on days 6 to 10. Bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained preceding and, when possible, following treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 242 of 537 (45%) patients, with the primary pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (28, 25, 13, 9, and 8% of isolates, respectively). Pathogens were eradicated or presumed to be eradicated in 87% (52 of 60), 91% (53 of 58), and 86% (60 of 70) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 82% (107 of 130), 86% (117 of 136), and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (5 days), cefuroxime axetil (10 days), and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days (P = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37 versus 19 and 15%, respectively; P < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. These results indicate that treatment with cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg twice daily for 5 days is as effective as treatment for 10 days with either the same dose of cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin-clavulanate at 500 mg three times daily in patients with acute bronchitis. In addition, treatment with cefuroxime axetil for either 5 or 10 days is associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea, than is 10-day treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate.
TI  - Clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis.
AB  - Two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials compared the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of two oral antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate, in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis (hereafter denoted acute bronchitis). Three hundred sixty patients with signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis were enrolled at 22 centers and were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with either cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (BID) (n= 177) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg three times daily (TID) (n = 183). Patients were assessed for both clinical and bacteriologic responses once during treatment (at 3 to 5 days) and twice after treatment (at 1 to 3 days and at 13 to 15 days). Bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained before treatment and, when possible, after treatment. Organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 162 (45%) of 360 patients, with the primary pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus (28%, 25%, 11%, 9%, and 8% of isolates, respectively). Thirty-four percent of the H influenzae isolates and 94% of the M catarrhalis isolates that were tested for beta-lactamase production were positive. A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 86% (117 of 136) and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 0.45). With respect to the eradication of bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure, presumed care, or cure with colonization) was obtained in 91% (53 of 58) and 86% (60 of 70) of bacteriologically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (P = 0.32). Treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil (39% vs 23%; P = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37% vs 15%; P < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. Four patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and eight patients in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group withdrew from the study because of drug-related adverse events. These results indicate that cefuroxime axetil 250 mg BID is as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg TID in the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis but produces fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea.
TI  - Head and neck space infections in infants and children.
AB  - A retrospective study was performed in 117 children with head and neck space infections treated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from January 1986 through June 1992. Peritonsillar space infections were the most common (49%), followed by retropharyngeal (22%), submandibular (14%), buccal (11%), parapharyngeal (2%), and canine (2%) space infections. The most common pathogens isolated (N = 78) were the aerobes beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18%), the anaerobes Bacteroides melaninogenicus (17%) and Veillonella (14%), and the gram-negative organism Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14%). beta-Lactamase production by aerobic pathogens was detected in 22% of cultures. Computed tomography scans (N = 16) were reviewed in blinded fashion and compared with operative findings. The sensitivity of computed tomography scan in detecting the presence of an abscess vs. cellulitis was high (91%), whereas the specificity was rather low (60%). Treatment of head and neck space infections in children should consist of accurate physical diagnosis aided by imaging studies, empiric antibiotic therapy that covers gram-negative and beta-lactamase--producing organisms as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes, and timely surgical intervention, when indicated.
TI  - [Clinical and laboratory studies on SY5555 in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Clinical effects of SY5555 dry syrup, a new oral penem antibiotic, were analysed  in 20 children with various bacterial infections. Ages of the patients varied from 8 months to 14 years. Doses of SY5555 were varied from 12.8 mg/kg/day to 30.5 mg/kg/day, and it was administered in 3 divided dosages. Clinical efficacy rates were as follows; 6/7 in acute bronchitis, 5/5 in pharyngotonsillitis, 3/3 in acute otitis media and 2/2 in cystitis and 3/3 in impetigo contagiosa. The overall rate was 95.0% (19/20). Bacteriologically, eradications were obtained with 1/2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3/3 of Staphylococcus aureus, 1/1 of Haemophilus influenzae, and each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens. Diarrhea was observed in 1 patient. And elevated eosinophiles or GPT was observed in one patient each. In vivo pharmacokinetics of SY5555 was examined in 2 cases. Peak plasma levels were observed at 1 hour after dosage in one patient and at 2 hours in another upon oral administration of 8.3 mg/kg of SY5555, and peak levels were 2.44 and 1.38 micrograms/ml respectively. Half-lives of SY5555 were 1.39 and 0.59 hr. Concentrations of SY5555 in urine after administration were 70.2 (2-4 hrs.) to 91.0 (0-5 hrs.) micrograms/ml, respectively. SY5555 dry syrup is considered as an useful and safe antibiotic in treating the infectious diseases in children.
TI  - [Balanitis and infectious agents. A prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the Centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the St. Louis Hospital in Paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. All underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. Sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. Two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Candida albicans (CA) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. A pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus milleri, group HB5) was found without CA in 28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group D streptococci) was found without CA in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. DISCUSSION: This series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with and without balanitis (p < 0.9). The role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? The significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. The clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.
TI  - [Potential pathogenic throat bacterial flora in acute successive pharyngitis and  tonsillitis in children].
AB  - The purpose of this work was to determine the frequency of occurrence of S. aureus, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae spp. and nonfermenting rods in a group of children suffering from acute successive pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Specimens were taken during three acute occurrences and twice after treatment from first and second acute occurrences. S. aureus was isolated from the throats of 55.1%-62% of the sick children. H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae were isolated from about 22% to over 40% of the sick children, beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated from 10.3%-16.2% of the sick children and Enterobacteriaceae spp. were isolated from the throats of 6.1%-16.25% of the sick children. Nonfermenting rods were isolated from only one sick child. Two or more possible bacterial pathogens were isolated from several sick children. Among them S. aureus with H. influenzae or with H. parainfluenzae or with beta-haemolytic streptococci were most often isolated. After treatment of these children, S. aureus, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae were more rarely isolated from the throat, and beta-haemolytic streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae spp. were isolated occasionally. Similarly, after treatment mixed potentially pathogenic bacterial flora were more rarely seen.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility tests with fastidious and nonfastidious bacterial reference strains: effects of aerobic versus hypercapnic incubation.
AB  - Representative antimicrobial drugs were examined under aerobic and hypercapnic (3 and 5% v/v CO2) incubation with the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion, a broth microdilution method, and the agar dilution procedure against nonfastidious, standard ATCC quality control strains and against two beta-hemolytic streptococcal, two pneumococcal, and three Haemophilus influenzae ATCC strains. It was found that an atmosphere of 3-5% CO2 merely antagonized amikacin, gentamicin, and netilmicin; the activity of penicillin G was antagonized only against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 in broth media, but not against any of the other strains. The activity of teicoplanin, and less so that of vancomycin, was enhanced only against S. aureus strain ATCC 25923, but not against the other strains. It was concluded that susceptibility tests, excluding aminoglycoside antibiotics, of beta-hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, and H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae should be incubated under 3% (candle jar or incubator) or 5% CO2 (incubator) so as to ensure optimal growth of capnephilic strains and thus avoid potentially misleading large inhibition zones of deceptively low minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - Randomized comparative trial with ampicillin/sulbactam versus cefamandole in the  therapy of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study ampicillin/sulbactam and cefamandole were compared in the therapy of patients hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia. Patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 37) and cefamandole (n = 38) were similar with respect to age (mean age 70 vs. 76 years respectively), clinical characteristics, severity of illness and underlying disease. Pathogens isolated from patients in the cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam group, respectively, were Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 vs. 7 patients), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (7 vs. 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (5 vs. 5 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (5 vs. 4 patients), Escherichia coli (4 vs. 4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 vs. 3 patients), Enterobacter spp. (2 vs. 3 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (1 vs. 2 patients), and organisms of the oral flora (4 vs. 3 patients). The rate of resistance to penicillin was 80%, to clindamycin 76%, to erythromycin 45%, to ampicillin 43%, and to cefazolin 18%. Overall successful treatment rates of 81% for cefamandole and 97% for ampicillin/sulbactam (p = 0.05) were observed. Both cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam were shown to be effective agents for therapy of community acquired pneumonia; however ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated superior overall clinical efficacy.
TI  - Microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  - The microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of Goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. Non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. Streptococci, predominantly S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. Haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. H. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and H. influenzae being identified in only one sample. Anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. Staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, S. epidermidis dominating. Fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. Thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.
TI  - Penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  - Recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. Failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. These organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and H parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Fusobacterium sp, and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect GABHS in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. Numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent GABHS tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both GABHS and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were performed in the field pediatrics. The following results were obtained. 1) Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of S-1006, the active form of S-1108, were studied against clinically isolated strains of (Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 3), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 8), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 5) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2). MIC values ranged < or = 0.025-1.56 for GPC and < or = 0.025-0.78 microgram/ml for GNR. 2) Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of S-1108 were measured upon administration of S-1108 after meal at dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), 4 mg/kg (n = 1) and 6 mg/kg (n = 1). The peak blood concentrations of S-1006 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), ranged from 0.57 to 1.82 micrograms/ml at 1, 2 and 4 hours after dosing. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters T1/2 and AUC were 1.29 +/- 0.69 hours and 4.47 +/- 2.25 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. At a dose of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 1.79 and 1.27 micrograms/ml at 2 and 3 hours after treatment. T1/2 and AUC were 1.34 and 1.11 hours, and 8.19 and 5.65 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates ranged from 13.0 to 37.2% for the first 8 hours after administration. 3) Clinical studies Clinical efficacies were examined in 32 cases of various pediatric infections including 5 cases of acute pneumonia, 11 cases of bronchitis, 2 cases of scarlet fever, 8 cases of tonsillitis, 1 case of pharyngitis, 2 cases of otitis media and 3 cases of UTI. Clinical efficacy rate was 96.9% (31/32) and bacteriological eradication rate was 87.1% (27/31). There were no side effects and abnormal laboratory test values except 1 case (Eosino. 2-->10%) in the 32 cases.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  - Nine pediatric patients with bacterial infections (5 cases of tonsillitis, 3 cases of impetigo and 1 case of UTI) were treated with S-1108, and the efficacy and the safety were evaluated. The clinical responses to S-1108 treatment were excellent in 7 cases and good in 2. The efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriologically, the causative organisms (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Escherichia coli) were eradicated. No clinical side effects were observed. Elevation of CK in 2 cases and eosinophilia in 1 case were noted.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefditoren pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) in granules, a new oral cephalosporin, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities: Antibacterial activities of CDTR were studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in comparison with those of cefteram (CFTM), cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and cefotiam (CTM). MIC80's of CDTR against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and B. catarrhalis were 1.56, 0.39, < or = 0.025, < or = 0.025, 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results showed that CDTR has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. 2. Absorption and excretion: Serum concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CDTR-PI (administered in granules) were determined. Upon single oral doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, the peak serum concentrations were 0.5-2.45 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.79-4.05 micrograms/ml at 1 to 4 hours, respectively, and T 1/2 was 1.07-9.67 hours and 0.99-3.00 hours, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, serum concentrations were 0-0.87 micrograms/ml with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 0.27-0.73 micrograms/ml with 6 mg/kg. These values indicated that the drug has a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours were 12.9-34.2% with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 11.8-26.9% with 6 mg/kg. 3. Clinical study: Clinical efficacies were examined in a total of 81 cases consisting of 20 cases of acute bronchitis, 13 of acute pneumonia, 21 of tonsillitis, 5 of pharyngitis, 7 of scarlet fever, 2 each of impetigo, otitis media and purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 1 of pertussis and 8 of UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 97.5% (79/81), and bacteriological eradication rate was 100% (76/76). As for side effects, 2 cases of watery stools and 1 case of minor elevation of GPT were observed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 18 patients (19 infections) were treated with CDTR-PI. The doses ranged 2.1-3.2 mg/kg, and it was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-10 days. Clinical efficacies of CDTR-PI in 18 patients with 19 bacterial infections (3 with tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 7 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 4 with otitis media, 1 with urinary tract infection, 2 with skin and soft tissue infection) were evaluated as excellent in 13 infections and as good in 6 infections with an efficacy rate of 100%. Twelve causative strains of 5 species were found in 11 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 cases out of 3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2/2, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 2/2 and Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Two patients had mild diarrhea but did not need specific treatment. Severe adverse reaction was not observed in any of the 18 patients. 2. MICs of CDTR were examined against 4 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae strains. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were relatively resistant to penicillins. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak serum CDTR concentrations in 3 patients were 2.38 micrograms/ml, 0.72 micrograms/ml and 2.25 micrograms/ml at a dose of CDTR-PI 3 mg/kg orally administered at 30-minute after meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefprozil granules].
AB  - Cefprozil granule preparation was administered orally to 16 patients (ages ranging 8 months to 9 years and 6 months) with pediatric bacterial infections at daily dose levels between 29.4 and 35.7 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses. The following results were obtained. 1. Sixteen patients including 5 with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 3 with lacunar tonsillitis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with contagious impetigo and 1 with scarlet fever were treated. Clinical effects were excellent in 9 cases and moderate in 7, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens included 17 strains (10 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 of Staphylococcus aureus). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed for 11 strains, but no changes were obtained for 5 (all Haemophilus), and unknown results were obtained for 1, thus the eradication rate was 68.8%. 3. No side effects were observed. Abnormal laboratory test results included 2 cases of increase in platelets, and 2 of increase in eosinophils, but those were not significant. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. Media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, MacConkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for Haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for Pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for Staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 U of polymyxin B per ml and 2 U of bacitracin per ml (OF-PBL medium) for Pseudomonas cepacia. With two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. The two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. In addition, the results of this study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. In rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Candida albicans, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, molds, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than Candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, P. cepacia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Changes in the spectrum of organisms causing respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  - Over the last decade, the spectrum of organisms causing community-acquired acute  lower respiratory tract infections has changed. Streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. The Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. Agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of Haemophilus influenzae other than type b, H. parainfluenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus. These organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in pediatric field].
AB  - We conducted a study on the pharmacokinetics and clinical application of cefpirome (CPR) in children. 1. A single intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CPR was given to a two-month-old boy, and the concentration of the drug in the blood was measured. Fifteen minutes after administration, the concentration was 53.3 micrograms/ml, and it gradually decreased thereafter, reaching a level of 5.18 micrograms/ml after 8 hours with a half-life in the plasma of 2.36 hours. 2. A single intravenous injection of 700 mg (50 mg/kg) of CPR and that of cefotaxime (CTX) were given to a girl with suppurative meningitis (3 years old, 14 kg, causative bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae), and concentrations of the drugs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid after 1 hour were measured. On the second day of illness, the concentration of CTX in the plasma was 39.4 micrograms/ml and the concentration of desacetyl-CTX (D-CTX) was 25.2 micrograms/ml, while concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were 6.22 micrograms/ml (15.8%) for CTX and 3.94 micrograms/ml (15.6%) for D-CTX. On the third day of illness, concentration of CPR in the plasma was 59.3 micrograms/ml, while its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was 7.44 micrograms/ml (12.5%). 3. CPR was intravenously administered in daily dosages of 37.7-75.0 mg/kg in 2-3 portions for periods of 4-15 days to 2 patients with septicemia (causative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 case and Escherichia coli in the other), 1 patient with bronchitis (K. pneumoniae), 9 patients with pneumonia (1 case of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 cases of H. influenzae, 2 cases of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 case of K. pneumoniae + Pseudomonas cepacia, 2 cases of H. influenzae + Branhamella catarrhalis), 2 patients with cellulitis (1 case of S. aureus, 1 case, causative agent unknown), 1 patient with suppurative lymphadenitis (causative agent, unknown), 1 patient with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 1 patient with renal abscess (causative agent, unknown), and 1 patient with a urinary tract infection (E. coli), for a total of 18 patients, with excellent results in 9 cases and good results in 9 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 4. As an accompanying side-effect, eruption was observed in 1 of the 18 patients, but when administration was discontinued, the symptom gradually receded, and it disappeared by the 4th day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion of NFLX after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. The mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. The mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. The mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. A dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of NFLX were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. In 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Escherichia coli 10 strains, Salmonella sp. 5 strains, Morganella morganii 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and Campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. Bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of C. jejuni only decreased. With regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. No abnormal laboratory test data were observed. From the above results, NFLX was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [The role of bacteria on facial rosacea-like dermatitis in adult type atopic dermatitis].
AB  - To investigate the role of bacteria on facial rosacea-like dermatitis lesion in adult type atopic dermatitis, we measured the numbers of bacteria on the skin, nasal and pharyngeal surface of each individual, and then examined its sensitivity to antibiotics. The numbers of bacteria on the surface of skin increased according to the severity of skin eruption. Staphylococcus aureus was detected from the skin and nasal surface more than pharyngeal surface. Bacteria on the pharyngeal surface were both staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae. Therefore, it is suggested that bacterial flora on the pharynx is different from those of the skin and nose. The treatment with antibiotics was effective for exudative lesions, whereas lichenified lesion did not respond to antibiotic therapy. These results suggest that bacteria on the skin surface are one of precipitating factors of the rosacea-like dermatitis of atopic dermatitis.
TI  - [Arterial embolism of the limbs in infectious endocarditis of the heart valves].
AB  - Nine cases of infective endocarditis (IE) on native valves, complicated by arterial embolism of the limbs (AEL), were collected between June 1974 and October 1988 (prevalence 4.3 percent). Among the 11 AEL recorded, 9 involved the lower limbs and 2 the upper limbs. The diagnosis, suspected in patients with acute ischaemia (n = 6), transient (n = 1) or pseudophlebitic (n = 1) pain, or discovered by systematic pulse examination (n = 3), was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound (n = 3), angiography (n = 2) or oscillometry (n = 4). AEL occurred 2.8 weeks on average after the onset of treatment; it appeared 6 months after the end of treatment in 1 case and preceded the diagnosis of IE by 1 to 6 weeks in 3 cases. The causative organisms isolated in 7 cases were: non-haemolytic streptococci (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 1) and enterococcus (n = 1). Vegetations were found in 6 of the 7 patients explored by echocardiography. Two cases of embolism of the femoral artery required embolectomy. Effective heparin anticoagulation was obtained in only one patient. Six patients underwent valve replacement in the acute phase of endocarditis. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 3 to 120 months), only one patient has symptoms (claudication of the left upper limb); 5 patients are asymptomatic with a reduced (n = 5) or abolished (n = 2) pulse. Three embolisms have left no sequelae. Altogether, AEL are not uncommon in infective endocarditis. They rarely influence the functional prognosis and are detected by systematic palpation of the pulses. Anticoagulation in effective doses is discussed. Attempts at removing the obstruction should be made only in cases with poorly tolerated proximal embolism. In patients with multiple or recurrent embolic accidents, valve replacement may be considered.
TI  - Effect of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid on the aerobic and anaerobic tonsillar microflora in the treatment of recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - 30 patients with recurrent tonsillitis were treated with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (500 mg/125 mg) t.i.d. for 10 days. The most often isolated potential aerobic pathogenic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus milleri and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Group A streptococci were isolated from 7 patients. Anaerobic cocci and Bacteroides species were the dominating anaerobic bacteria isolated from the tonsils. Tonsillar cultures were taken before antibiotic treatment started, on days 11-12, day 30, and day 90. Beta-lactamase producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 13 patients prior to treatment, on days 11-12 in 18 patients, on day 30 in 15 patients, and on day 90 in 13 patients. Group A streptococci were eradicated in 6/7 patients. In the aerobic tonsillar microflora, the numbers of viridans streptococci decreased during treatment but were normalized after 30 days. Only minor changes in the numbers of other aerobic microorganisms occurred during the investigation. The effect on the anaerobic microflora was minor and no new colonizing microorganisms were isolated during or after antibiotic treatment. All patients except one were cured on days 11-12. Five patients had another episode of tonsillitis during the observation period of 3 months. The antibiotic treatment was well tolerated in most patients and mild adverse events such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in 3 patients.
TI  - Pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  Zimbabwe, Central Africa.
AB  - During the 11 month period up to 30 September 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - [Fundamental studies on rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)].
AB  - To establish a rapid method for detection of Haemophilus influenzae, an antiserum against H. influenzae (Anti-HibOMP) was prepared by immunization of rabbits with crude outer membrane proteins (OMP) of H. influenzae type b. Various isolates of H. influenzae including typable and nontypable strains and other species were tested by ELISA and Western blot assay with Anti-HibOMP. The results are as follows: 1. Anti-HibOMP reacted to all of the OMPs from 18 H. influenzae isolates which contained typable and nontypable strains by Western blot assay. Molecular weights of these OMPs were about 24, 27, 31, 34, 39 and 45 kilo-dalton. This result suggests that all H. influenzae isolates have identical antigenic proteins on their outer membranes. 2. It was found that 172 out of 179 (96%) culture suspensions of H. influenzae isolates including 66 typable and 113 nontypable showed positive result by ELISA with Anti-HibOMP. 3. To define the cross-reactivity of Anti-HibOMP, 20 species (111 isolates) other than H. influenzae were tested by the ELISA. All isolates were negative with exception of a portion of H. parainfluenzae and Staphylococcus aureus producing Protein A. The cross-reactions to H. parainfluenzae and S. aureus were removed by absorption of Anti-HibOMP with formalinized cells of H. parainfluenzae and reduction of the antibody to F(ab)2 with pepsin digestion respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  - Five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. Bacterial species commonly isolated from infected sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--Enterobacteriacae, Neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and Candida albicans--were similarly studied. Of the "pathogens", the Gram negative species B catarrhalis, H parainfluenzae and Ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for the Gram positive species S aureus and S pneumoniae. Of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the Enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. These results show that some Gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - The usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. Twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with SBT/ABPC and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. Clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of Mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. There was no case of failure. 2. Bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 Escherichia coli and 1 Serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. Of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. Rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated GOT and GPT were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. Blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. Blood levels of SBT and ABPC at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. The half-lives of SBT were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of ABPC were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in children].
AB  - Sulbactam/Ampicillin (SBT/ABPC), a combination at a fixed ratio of ABPC and SBT which is an irreversible inhibitor of beta-lactamase in a 2:1 ratio, was clinically evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 24 patients with ages from 5 month-old to 12 years old with bacterial infection. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. A pharmacokinetic study following 30 mg/kg SBT/ABPC administration by 30 minutes drip infusion or intravenous bolus injection showed that mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC were 48.9 minutes and 40.2 minutes, respectively, and mean urinary excretion rates of SBT and ABPC in the first 6 hours were 67.1% and 48.3%, respectively. 2. SBT/ABPC was administered to 14 patients with bronchopneumonia, 4 patients with tonsillitis, a patient each with acute upper respiratory infection, with submandibular lymphadenitis, with phlegmon, with enterocolitis, with pyelonephritis and with cystitis at a daily dosage of 88.2-133.3 mg/kg, divided into 3 or 4, by intravenous bolus injection or by 30 minutes drip infusion. Clinical responses of the 24 patients were as follows: excellent: 17 patients, good: 7 patients. The efficacy rate was 100%. 3. Neither clinical adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory test values, except slight eosinophilia in a patient and an elevation of GOT, GPT in another were observed. 4. MICs of SBT/ABPC against 7 strong beta-lactamase producing strains isolated from some of the patients were as follows. MIC against a strain of Staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml, MICs against 2 out of 5 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were 0.10 microgram/ml and those of the remaining 3 strains were 0.20 microgram/ml. MIC against a strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae was 3.13 micrograms/ml. 5. These data described above show that SBT/ABPC has excellent bactericidal capacity against beta-lactamase producing bacteria as well as beta-lactamase non-producing Gram-positive and negative bacteria and suggest that SBT/ABPC is a very useful antibiotic for pediatric patients.
TI  - [Studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. Absorption and excretion Serum levels and urinary excretion of SBT/ABPC were studied in 4 children with ages 6 to 8 years. The mean serum concentration of SBT at 15 minutes following a single intravenous injection of 30 mg/kg of SBT/ABPC was 27.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml and that of ABPC was 42.8 +/- 3.9 micrograms/ml, and their concentrations declined with mean half-lives of 1.06 +/- 0.15 hours and 0.84 +/- 0.05 hour, respectively, and at 6 hours were 0.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml on the average, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC at 6 hours after the injection were 59.0 +/- 22.4% and 58.4 +/- 25.3% on the average, respectively. 2. Clinical study SBT/ABPC was used for the treatment of a total of 36 pediatric patients with ages ranging 2 months to 11 years and it's clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in 5 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, 26 with acute pneumonia and 1 with acute pyelonephritis were judged to be excellent in 27 cases and good in 5 cases with an overall efficacy ratio of 100.0%. Clinical efficacies in 6 patients whose infections were caused by beta-lactamase producing strains were judged to be excellent in all cases. Bacteriological efficacies of SBT/ABPC were assessed on 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 16 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (5 beta-lactamase producing strains and 11 non-beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 non-beta-lactamase strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 2 strains of Escherichia coli (non-beta-lactamase producing strains). All strains except 1 strain of H. influenzae (beta-lactamase producing strain) which decreased in number were eradicated with a bacteriological eradication rate of 95.5%. Only 1 patient complained of diarrhea which was suspected to be related to the drug. No other side effect was reported. Elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in only 1 patient. The above results suggested that SBT/ABPC was a useful drug with preferable safety profile in the treatment for pediatric patients with infectious disease caused by beta-lactamase producing strains as well as those by non-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - Occult polymicrobial endocarditis with Haemophilus parainfluenzae in intravenous  drug abusers.
AB  - PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fewer than 8 percent of intravenous drug abusers are found to have polymicrobial endocarditis. We report on cases of occult polymicrobial infective endocarditis with Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 10 intravenous drug abusers. Clinical and laboratory data on all 10 patients were obtained from hospital charts, and information on illicit drug use methods was given by five patients. Blood cultures were performed, as well as susceptibility testing to antibiotics. Subsequent molecular epidemiologic studies were performed on selected Staphylococcus aureus and H. parainfluenzae strains. Phage typing of S. aureus and biotyping of H. parainfluenzae strains were also done. RESULTS: Results of the initial blood cultures were positive on the second to fifth days (mean, 2.6 days), demonstrating a gram-positive pathogen in nine patients and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus in one. Significantly, in each case, H. parainfluenzae alone was subsequently identified from additional blood cultures, with a mean delay of 20.4 days (range, five to 57 days) to the isolation of this organism. Epidemiologic data indicated that our cases did not represent a point-source outbreak. Antibiotic therapy uniformly failed until an agent active against H. parainfluenzae was added. The constellation of clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic findings was similar, and permitted prospective diagnosis and therapy in three patients. Despite the absence of S. aureus bacteremia in four, all 10 patients had right-sided endocarditis with septic pulmonary emboli. Five patients had initial blood cultures that were positive for two facultative gram-positive cocci (S. aureus and commensal oral streptococcal species). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that polymicrobial endocarditis with H. parainfluenzae in intravenous drug abusers is a distinct clinical syndrome, and should be considered in all patients if the response to appropriate antibiotics is atypical or if pulmonary emboli continue with therapy.
TI  - [Clinical study of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, in children].
AB  - 1. Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) was given orally to 46 children with respiratory infections, skin infections and others. A total of 9 patients were excluded; 8 patients refused to take the drug because of it's taste, and 1 patient was later found to have viral pneumonia. Clinical efficacy was therefore evaluated in remaining 37 cases and was good or excellent in 27 cases. 2. Bacteriologically, Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from 4 patients were eradicated in 1 and decreased in 3, respectively. Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from 1 patient each were both eradicated. 3. Side effect or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 4. Based on the above findings, it appears that TE-031 is a safe and is useful antibiotic for the treatment of mild and moderate respiratory infections. It is necessary, however, to improve the taste of the current granule preparation in order to make the drug more easily palatable to children.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 96% clinically and 72% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 5. None of children refused TE-031.
TI  - [Clinical experience with sultamicillin fine granules in pediatric field].
AB  - Sultamicillin fine granules were used orally in 18 pediatric patients with infections in doses ranging 7.3-10.0 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. The following is a summary of the results: 1. Clinical efficacies in 16 cases with tonsillitis were excellent in 13 cases, good in 2 cases and fair in 1 case. Efficacy in 1 case of bronchitis and 1 case of pneumonia were good. The overall efficacy rate in the 18 cases was 94.4%. 2. Four out of 5 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were eradicated but 1 strain persisted. Three out of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were rated as eradicated, 1 strain as decreased and 3 strains as persisted. Two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 3 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were eradicated. The bacteriological efficacy rate for the 17 strains was 70.6%. Four strains out of the 17 were found to produce beta-lactamase and 3 strains were suspected, to produce the enzyme, but of these 7 strains, 5 strains were eradicated. 3. Diarrhea and loose stool were observed as side effects in each of 2 cases. It appeared that diarrhea was related to this drug. A slight elevation of GOT was observed in 1 case in laboratory tests. 4. This drug appears to be easy for children to take in terms of taste and smell.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of A-56268 (TE-031) and erythromycin against 306  clinical isolates.
AB  - The inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) activities of a new macrolide A-56268 (TE-031) against 306 clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was compared with that of erythromycin. The MIC90/MBC90 ratios for A-56268 were: Campylobacter jejuni 4/16, Haemophilus influenzae 8/8-16, H. parainfluenzae 8/8-16, Legionella pneumophila 0.06/0.5, methicillin-sensitive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 0.5/1, and coagulase negative staphylococci 1/8, methicillin resistant isolates of Staph. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci greater than 16/ greater than 16, Streptococcus pneumoniae 0.06/0.125, streptococcus Group A 0.06/2-4, streptococcus Group B 0.06/8- greater than 16, streptococcus Groups C and G 0.125/8 and Str. faecalis 4/64. Compared with erythromycin, A-56268 had greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity against isolates of L. pneumophila, with an MIC90 16-fold less and an MBC90 eight-fold less than that of erythromycin. Except for enterococci, A-56268 showed inhibitory activity equal to or greater than that of penicillin G against isolates of streptococci and an MIC two-fold less than that of erythromycin. For other strains tested, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar. The clinical importance of the differences between these two macrolides will depend on the pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration properties of the new compound.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetical, bacteriological and clinical studies of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetical, bacteriological and clinical studies of flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S), a new cephem antibiotic, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Mean drug concentrations in the blood after intravenous one shot injection of FMOX 20 mg/kg to 5 children (aged 5-8 years) were 39.7 micrograms/ml at 1/4 hour, 24.1 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 12.2 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.7 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 1.1 microgram/ml at 4 hours, and 0.3 microgram/ml at 6 hours. The mean half-life in blood was 0.65 hour. Mean concentrations in urine was 3,558 micrograms/ml during 0-2 hours after intravenous injection, 568 micrograms/ml during 2-4 hours, and 117 micrograms/ml during 4-6 hours. The mean 6-hour urinary recovery rate was 72.8%. 2. Clinically, FMOX was administered to 32 children (5 months to 9 years) with infections, i.e. 29 with pneumonia, 1 each with acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent lymphadenitis and cellulitis. The treatment was excellent in 24 cases and good in 8. Thus, the efficacy rate was 100%. 3. The bacteriological effect of FMOX was investigated using 11 clinical isolates which were considered to be causative organisms, i.e. 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Except one strain (H. influenzae) which was just decreased, all the bacteria were eliminated. 4. No side effect was found at all. As abnormal laboratory findings, elevation of GOT was found in 1 case, thrombocytosis in 2, and eosinophilia in 1 but all the changes were slight and were normalized by the time of re-examination. The above results suggest that FMOX is a useful and safe drug for the pediatric practice just as in the adult field.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new cephem type antibiotic, in the pediatric field. A total of 9 pediatric patients (2-14 years) was treated with intravenous injection of CZON: 4 cases with one shot of 20 mg/kg, 2 cases with one shot of 40 mg/kg and 3 cases with drip infusion over 1 hour of 40 mg/kg. CZON concentrations in serum and the excretion in urine were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 49.0, 22.7, 9.03, 2.13, 0.37, and 0.09 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg one shot intravenous injections, mean serum concentrations were 117.5, 68.0, 26.2, 8.80, 0.63 and 0.19 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg intravenous drip infusions over 1 hour, mean concentrations were 57.1, 78.8, 12.9, 1.12 and 0.23 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. Mean half-lives were 0.69 hour for 20 mg/kg one shot injections, 0.44 hour for 40 mg/kg one shot injections, and 0.58 hour for 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusions. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hour after administration were 70.8% (mean) for the 20 mg/kg one shot injection, 44.1% (1 case) for the 40 mg/kg one shot injection, and 60.0% (mean) for the 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusion. CZON was administered in 26 cases of pediatric infections, and the clinical efficacy, antibacterial activity, and side effects were evaluated. Of the 26 cases 2 were excluded for the reason of not having bacterial infection, and the remaining 24 cases were assessed. Included in the 24 cases were 16 cases of acute pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent lymphadenitis, and 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent otitis media, acute apical periodontitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), acute pyelonephritis, and acute enteritis. Clinical efficacy evaluation showed 19 excellent cases and 5 good cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, beta-Streptococcus 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 10 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain, Proteus mirabilis 1 strain, and Campylobacter jejuni 1 strain were determined or assumed as pathogens, but all of them were eradicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new injectable cephalosporin, was used in 12 pediatric patients with infections. The following is a summary of the results: The 12 cases included 3 cases of tonsillitis (pathogen: Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 1 case, Haemophilus influenzae in 2 cases), 4 cases of pneumonia (Staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, pathogen unknown in 3 cases), 2 cases of nephropyelitis (Escherichia coli in 2 cases), 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis (pathogen unknown), 1 case of purulent thyroiditis (mixed infection of Streptococcus milleri, Haemophilus aphrophilus and anaerobes), and 1 case of vulvar abscess (E. coli). Dose levels of CZON were 42.9 approximately 93.3 mg/kg/day divided into 3 or 4 times and the drug was intravenously injected for 6 to 12 days. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases, good in 5 cases, and poor in 3 cases, with the efficacy rate of 75.0%. The 3 cases with poor efficacy consisted of 1 case each of pneumonia complicated with chronic granulomatosis, purulent thyroiditis associated with piriform recess fistula, and purulent lymphadenitis of armpit developed after surgical operation of congenital heart disease. In the first 2 cases satisfactory efficacy was not obtained by chemotherapy alone, and complete cure was seen after surgical operation. Side effects were not observed clinically. One case each of slight prolongation of prothrombin time and transient elevations of GOT and GPT values were noted but no severe abnormalities were found in laboratory tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  - The emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. A significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Bacteroides species and Fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. One beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three Staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase-production in Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli strain. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. The increase of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group A streptococci when previous treatment has failed.
TI  - Impact on peritonsillar infections and microflora of phenoxymethylpenicillin alone versus phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - In a double-blind study, 20 patients with peritonsillar abscesses were treated with 2 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days together with needle aspiration, incision and daily drainage, and 20 patients were treated with 2 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. and 0.8 g metronidazole b.i.d. for ten days together with needle aspiration, incision and daily drainage. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from pus in 20 of the patients with peritonsillar abscesses, in five of these together with indigenous oropharyngeal aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Pure anaerobic bacteria were found in nine abscesses, together with indigenous aerobic microorganisms in eight, and together with group A, C and G streptococci in five. In one patient heavily colonized with beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Bacteroides, group A beta-streptococci failed to be eradicated. In the penicillin group, nine of 18 patients harboured beta-lactamase producing Bacteroides strains in the tonsils on the day of admission. On the third and tenth days of treatment all patients harboured beta-lactamase producing Bacteroides strains in the tonsils, while in the penicillin + metronidazole group, only one out of 17 patients still harboured beta-lactamase producing Bacteroides strains. None of the patients harboured beta-lactamase producing fusobacteria on the day of admission. In the penicillin group, however, beta-lactamase producing fusobacteria were recovered from three patients on the tenth day of treatment. No beta-lactamase producing fusobacteria were recovered from the penicillin + metronidazole group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Josamycin: interpretation of inhibition zones with the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test as compared with erythromycin.
AB  - A total of 432 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (128), coagulase-negative staphylococci (123), group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci (61), group D streptococci (30), Streptococcus penumoniae (29), Haemophilus influenzae (19), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (12), and Legionella pneumophila (30) were examined with the agar dilution and Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion tests for susceptibility to josamycin as compared with erythromycin. On a weight-for-weight basis, erythromycin was more active than josamycin against all bacterial species, including L. pneumophila. Josamycin inhibited 18 of 23 S. aureus and 11 of 16 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains resistant to erythromycin. Utilizing minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) breakpoints of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml (sensitive), 4 microgram/ml (intermediate) and of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (resistant), and inhibition zone criteria of greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter (sensitive), 14-17 mm (intermediate), and less than or equal to 13 mm (resistant), and excluding L. pneumophila, there was good correlation between erythromycin MIC and corresponding disk diffusion data for staphylococci and streptococci, but not for Haemophilus species. In comparison, josamycin yielded a significant number of minor discrepant data for group D streptococci and Haemophilus species. It is suggested that erythromycin and josamycin should not be tested against Haemophilus species, and that josamycin should be excluded from test batteries against enterococci. Erythromycin-resistant staphylococci require separate testing with josamycin.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - Evaluation of the rapid penicillinase paper strip test for detection of beta-lactamase.
AB  - The penicillin-starch paper strip method was compared with the acidometric and iodometric methods for assaying beta-lactamase production, using fresh isolates of clinically important bacteria. Results obtained by the three methods were compared for rapidity, accuracy, and stability of reagents. Of the 210 isolates tested by the paper strip method, 301 isolates tested by the acidometric method, and 117 isolates tested by the iodometric method, all were in perfect agreement with the disk diffusion susceptibility test except one strain each of Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The H. influenzae isolate was penicillin resistant and failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase in all three tests. The staphylococci (intermediate and resistant in susceptibility, respectively) failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase with the iodometric method. The results of the paper strip method, in which 3,241 strains representing nine species of bacteria were used, correlated completely with disk susceptibility tests except for 2 and 69 strains, respectively, of penicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. The results of this study indicate that the paper strip method is accurate, simple to perform, extremely economical, and uses materials that are stable when stored frozen. It is eminently suitable for routine laboratory use.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  - The bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  Patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. Aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. Anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. There were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 Bacteroides sp. (including 6 B. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 Fusobacterium sp. There were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of S. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. Beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. These included all isolates of S. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of B. melaninogenicus. The presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. In the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Metabolism of phosphatidylglycerol, lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus accumulated cardiolipin (CL) and lost phosphatidylglycerol  (PG) during the stationary phase of growth. The minor lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglucose, also accumulated, whereas the lysylphosphatidylglycerol (LPG) content of the membrane remained constant as stationary phase continued. During exponential growth, the proportions and total content of phospholipids per cell remained constant. The metabolism of the phospholipids was examined under these conditions. In pulse-chase experiments, the phospholipids lost (14)C from the glycerols slower than (32)P. When the phospholipids were labeled with (14)C glycerol, the unacylated glycerols of PG and LPG lost (14)C, whereas the diacylated glycerols either accumulated or did not lose (14)C. In all experiments, the PG showed a more rapid metabolism than the LPG. When staphylococcal CL was hydrolyzed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae CL-specific phospholipase D into phosphatidic acid (PA) and PG, the incorporation of (32)P into both of the phosphates of CL was found to be parallel at both the PG and PA ends of the molecule. However, the specific activity of the (32)P at the PA end was twice that at the PG end of the molecule. The PG end of the CL apparently came from a portion of the cellular PG pool with about 20% the specific activity of the total cellular PG. The turnover of two of the glycerols of the PG portion of CL was like that of the cellular PG. The diacylated glycerol of the PG and of CL and of the membrane PG showed neither turnover nor incorporation of (14)C. Half of the radioactivity was lost from the middle glycerol of CL and the free glycerol of the cellular PG in one bacterial doubling. The diacylated glycerol from the other end of the CL molecule (the PA end) lost radioactivity almost as rapidly as the middle glycerol for 10 min. After the initial rapid loss, the turnover slowed to a rate 10 times slower than the middle glycerol, indicating that the (14)C was actually accumulating at this end of the molecule. The phosphates and glycerols involved in the hydrolysis and resynthesis of the CL molecule during exponential growth in S. aureus apparently come from different pools of PG.
