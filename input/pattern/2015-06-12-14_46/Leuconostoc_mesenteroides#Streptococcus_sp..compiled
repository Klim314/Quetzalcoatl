TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from Northwestern Argentina.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from Northwestern Argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at Maimara (chicha M) and Tumbaya (chicha T). Whereas by culture-dependent approach a few number of species (Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens in chicha M, and Enterococcus faecium and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha T) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. The relative abundance of OTUs was higher in chicha M than in chicha T; six LAB genera were common for chicha M and T: Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus while Pediococcus only was detected in chicha M. Among the 46 identified LAB species, those of Lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas Enterococcus and Leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha T and M, respectively. Identification at species level showed the predominance of Lb. plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Leuconostoc lactis and W. viridescens in chicha M while Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium, Lc. mesenteroides and Weissella confusa predominated in chicha T samples. In parallel, when presumptive LAB isolates (chicha M: 146; chicha T: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by ISR-PCR and RAPD-PCR profiles, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the Leuconostoc genus (Lc. mesenteroides and Lc. lactis) in chicha M, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus being also present. In contrast, chicha T exhibited the presence of Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, E. faecium being the most representative species. Massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. Although differences in the LAB species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant LAB species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. The fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on LAB population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Production of a low calorie mandarin juice by enzymatic conversion of constituent sugars to oligosaccharides and prevention of insoluble glucan formation.
AB  - Over 99% of sucrose in mandarin juice (57.1 g/l in original juice to 428.4 g/l in concentrated juice) was enzymatically converted to glucooligosaccharides using 3 U dextransucrase/ml prepared from Leuconostoc mesenteroides at 28 degrees C. The oligosaccharide synthesis yields were 51 and 47% for the original and the concentrated mandarin juice, respectively. The degree of polymerization of oligosaccharides in the enzyme-modified juice was 2-7. Calories in the original and modified mandarin juice were 433 and 301 kcal/l (30.5% reduction). Compared with the original juice, the enzyme-modified juice showed 82% decrease of insoluble glucan formation by mutansucrase from Streptococcus mutans. A sensory evaluation of the juices revealed that the original and modified mandarin juices had sweetness values of 4.5 and 4.9 and the same values for overall acceptability.
TI  - In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.
AB  - Twelve lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected in vitro (Gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for the continuous four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.
TI  - Designing of a novel dextransucrase efficient in acceptor reactions.
AB  - Dextransucrase is produced by Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus Species. The enzyme synthesizes dextran and acceptor products some of which act as prebiotics that are increasingly used in such industries as food, medicine, and cosmetics. B-512F Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase (DSR-S) is the preferred enzyme in commercial production of dextran and prebiotics. In the present work, a novel dextransucrase which is efficient in prebiotics production was designed. The enzyme was produced at optimal conditions in Escherichia coli by truncation and fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512 FMC. The novel enzyme (MW: 119 kDa) was active and carried out dextran biosynthesis and acceptor reactions effectively. The novel dextransucrase (fTDSR-S) was produced by truncating signal, variable, and the glucan-binding regions in the gene and fusion of gst gene at the 5' end. fTDSR-S was characterized in detail and compared to the DSR-S. Truncation and fusion resulted in an increase in fTDSR-S biosynthesis in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by 35 fold. fTDSR-S leads to production of dextran as well as increased acceptor reactions. Due to GST fusion, it was possible to immobilize fTDSR-S covalently onto Eupergit C successfully. It was also found that the size of the active site of dextransucrase is 49 amino acids shorter than that reported previously in the literature.
TI  - Microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative Listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  - The study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of St-Nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. On the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named TR15 (Truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: TR15-SC (58 isolates from TR15 collection), TR15-M (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and TR15-BHI (pools of isolates from BHI medium). Their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk were compared with the activity of complex consortium TR15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The natural consortium TR15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium TR15-BHI. The dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16S rDNA sequencing and direct 16S rDNA Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis. The combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium TR15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. Cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Enterococcus gilvus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as Arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas psychrophila and Enterobacter spp.). The highest L. monocytogenes count was on rind with TR15-M and was positively associated with the highest pH value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by Staphylococcus vitulinus, Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium gubbeenense and Brachybacterium tyrofermentans. The results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. It is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.
TI  - Studies on changes in microstructure and proteolysis in cow and soy milk curd during fermentation using lactic cultures for improving protein bioavailability.
AB  - Cow milk curd was prepared using 2% v/v of Streptococcus thermophilus DG1 and a mixed culture (0.5:1.5 v/v) of S. thermophilus DG1 and Lactobacillus plantarum and incubating at 37 degrees C for 16 h. Soy milk curd was prepared using different ratios of lactic cultures as stated earlier and also a mixed culture containing S. thermophilus DG1, L. plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides sub spp. mesenteroides in the ratio 1:1:1 v/v along with beet pulp (2% w/w) and incubating at 37 degrees C for 18 h. This improved functional and probiotic properties of curd. Structural changes in curd samples during fermentation were observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Soy milk curd showed loosened structure. The degradation of proteins into peptides and amino acids were evaluated by SDS PAGE and amino acid analysis. Maximum production of amino acids i.e. cystine, histidine and asparagine were observed in both the cow and soymilk after fermentation.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Concentration dependent effects of dextran on the physical properties of acid milk gels.
AB  - The effect of dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (DEX500), added to milk prior to acidification with glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) or Streptococcus thermophilus DSM20259, was studied with respect to polysaccharide concentration. The incorporation of 5-30 g/kg DEX500 significantly affected gelation behavior. Increasing DEX500 concentrations resulted in a linear increase of gel stiffness (GDL gels: R(2)=0.96; microbial acidification: R(2)=0.94; P<0.05) and 30 g/kg DEX500 resulted in a 2-fold higher stiffness compared to gels without polysaccharide. The respective stirred gels depicted a significant reduction in syneresis, which decreased from 30.4% (0 g/kg DEX500) to 22.0% (30 g/kg DEX500) for chemically acidified gels after 1 d of storage. Physical characteristics of DEX500 in aqueous solution were helpful to explain its behavior in the complex system milk.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of Serbia and lowland regions of Croatia.
AB  - The goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (BG) and nine fresh soft (ZG) artisanal cheeses collected in Serbia and Croatia. While LAB were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all BG cheeses but only in three ZG cheese samples. High LAB and yeast species diversity was determined (average H'(L)=0.4 and H'(Y)=0.8, respectively). The predominant LAB species in white pickled (BG) cheeses were Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (ZG) cheeses the most dominant LAB species were L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Among the 20 yeast species found, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida zeylanoides, and Torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in BG cheeses, while Yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in ZG cheeses. The characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of LAB isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of LAB strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic or proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of LAB and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. The knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific LAB and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu, a typical Chinese traditional bacteria-fermented soybean product.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kedong sufu is a typical bacteria-fermented sufu in China. Isolation  and identification of the autochthonous bacteria involved would allow the design of specific starters for this speciality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and culturing. RESULTS: In terms of bacterial diversity, 22 strains were isolated and identified and 27 strains were detected by DGGE. Regarding bacterial dynamics, the results of culturing and PCR-DGGE exhibited a similar trend towards dominant strains. Throughout the fermentation of sufu, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus carnosus were the dominant microflora, while the secondary microflora comprised Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus lutetiensis, Kocuria rosea, Kocuria kristinae, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to reveal the bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This information will help in the design of autochthonous starter cultures for the production of Kedong sufu with desirable characteristic sensory profiles and shorter ripening times.
TI  - The microbiology of Bandji, palm wine of Borassus akeassii from Burkina Faso: identification and genotypic diversity of yeasts, lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physicochemical characteristics and especially genotypic diversity of the main culturable micro-organisms involved in fermentation of sap from Borassus akeassii, a newly identified palm tree from West Africa. METHODS AND RESULTS: Physicochemical characterization was performed using conventional methods. Identification of micro-organisms included phenotyping and sequencing of: 26S rRNA gene for yeasts, 16S rRNA and gyrB genes for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB). Interspecies and intraspecies genotypic diversities of the micro-organisms were screened respectively by amplification of the ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2/16S-23S rDNA ITS regions and repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). The physicochemical characteristics of samples were: pH: 3.48-4.12, titratable acidity: 1.67-3.50 mg KOH g(-1), acetic acid: 0.16-0.37%, alcohol content: 0.30-2.73%, sugars (degrees Brix): 2.70-8.50. Yeast included mainly Saccharomyces cerevisiae and species of the genera Arthroascus, Issatchenkia, Candida, Trichosporon, Hanseniaspora, Kodamaea, Schizosaccharomyces, Trigonopsis and Galactomyces. Lactobacillus plantarum was the predominant LAB species. Three other species of Lactobacillus were also identified as well as isolates of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Fructobacillus durionis and Streptococcus mitis. Acetic acid bacteria included nine species of the genus Acetobacter with Acetobacter indonesiensis as predominant species. In addition, isolates of Gluconobacter oxydans and Gluconacetobacter saccharivorans were also identified. Intraspecies diversity was observed for some species of micro-organisms including four genotypes for Acet. indonesiensis, three for Candida tropicalis and Lactobacillus fermentum and two each for S. cerevisiae, Trichosporon asahii, Candida pararugosa and Acetobacter tropicalis. CONCLUSION: fermentation of palm sap from B. akeassii involved multi-yeast-LAB-AAB cultures at genus, species and intraspecies level. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: First study describing microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of palm wine from B. akeassii. Genotypic diversity of palm wine LAB and AAB not reported before is demonstrated and this constitutes valuable information for better understanding of the fermentation which can be used to improve the product quality and develop added value by-products.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Isolation and identification of cultivable lactic acid bacteria in traditional yak milk products of Gansu Province in China.
AB  - Various traditional fermented yak milk and raw milk foods could be considered as  an abundant resource for obtaining novel lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with unique properties. Eighty-eight samples of yak milk products were collected from Gansu Province in China. Three hundred and nineteen strains of LAB isolated from these samples were identified by phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology. Among the isolates, one hundred and sixty-four isolates (51.41% of the total) were classified under Lactobacilli, and one hundred and fifty-five (48.59%) belonged to cocci. All the isolates were classified to six genera (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Weissella) and twenty-one species. Lactobacillus helveticus (87 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (49 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (39 strains), Lactobacillus casei (31 strains) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (19 strains) were considered as the predominant populations in the yak milk products. The results showed that there were abundant genus and species LAB existing in yak milk products in Gansu Province in China. The obtained LAB pure cultures may be a valuable source for further starter selection.
TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - Transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylases toward different classes of acceptors.
AB  - In this study, the transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylase (SP) enzymes has been compared using eighty putative acceptors from different structural classes. To increase the solubility of hydrophobic acceptors, the addition of various co-solvents was first evaluated. All enzymes were found to retain at least 50% of their activity in 25% dimethylsulfoxide, with the enzymes from Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Streptococcus mutans being the most stable. Screening of the enzymes' specificity then revealed that the vast majority of acceptors are transglucosylated very slowly by SP, at a rate that is comparable to the contaminating hydrolytic reaction. The enzyme from S. mutans displayed the narrowest acceptor specificity and the one from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B1355 the broadest. However, high activity could only be detected on l-sorbose and l-arabinose, besides the native acceptors d-fructose and phosphate. Improving the affinity for alternative acceptors by means of enzyme engineering will, therefore, be a major challenge for the commercial exploitation of the transglucosylation potential of sucrose phosphorylase.
TI  - Reidentification of Streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  - All Streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from January 2003 to January 2010 (n = 52) at the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. Initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic Wider system (Fco. Soria-Melguizo, Spain) and the API 20 Strep system (bioMerieux, France). All isolates were reidentified by PCR amplification and sequencing of both the 16S rRNA and sodA genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker, Germany). Results of 16S rRNA/sodA gene sequencing were as follows: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16S rRNA/number of isolates identified by sodA gene sequencing); Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; Streptococcus spp., 7/0; Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; Streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 4/0; and Lactococcus lactis, 3/3. MALDI-TOF MS identified 27 S. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 L. mesenteroides isolates, 3 L. lactis isolates, and 6 S. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. The percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. The most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). We conclude that sequencing of the sodA gene was the most discriminatory method and that S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  - The oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. The oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. Glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. The 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by VITEK system using gram-positive identification cards. Species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for PCR identification of isolates. Sequencing of 16S rRNA was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. VITEK system identified a number of 11 strains as S. mitis/oralis, 12 strains as S. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as S. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3 strains as S. salivarius, 3 strains as S. plurianimalium, 1 strain as S. cristatus and 1 strain as S. alactolyticus, respectively. The PCR system targeting gtf genes was able to identify S. oralis, S. salivarius and S. gordonii strains. Sequence of 16S rRNA discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. Their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. In infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) are added to replace HMOs. This study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest HMO components, defined HMOs, and GOSs. All strains grew on lactose and glucose. N-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in L. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in all strains. Both hetero- and homofermentative LAB utilized N-acetylglucosamine via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. plantarum were the most versatile in hydrolysing pNP analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined HMOs. Whole cells of all six LAB hydrolysed oNP-galactoside and pNP-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. High beta-galactosidase activity of L. reuteri, L. fermentum, S. thermophilus and L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and GOS hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of lactose and GOSs by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that LAB beta-galactosidases are involved in GOS digestion. In summary, the strains of LAB used were not capable of utilizing complex HMOs but metabolized HMO components and GOSs.
TI  - Heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LacA) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of oNPG, pNPG and pNPG-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) formation to GH2 beta-galactosidases of Streptococcus thermophilus (LacZ type), Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both LacLM type). Beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in Lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with L. lactis crude cell extract (CCE). The novel GH42 beta-galactosidase of Lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, oNPG and pNPG but higher relative activity on pNP analogues compared to GH2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. Temperature and pH optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between GH2 beta-galactosidases. oNPG and pNPG were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pNPG-analogues was less than 1.5%. GH2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar GOS with varying preferences. The diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis CCE can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Pecorino Crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal Pecorino Crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout cheese ripening, with the dominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus species. Bacterial dynamics determined by Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. Moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of Pecorino Crotonese cheeses by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.
TI  - Functional, genetic, and bioinformatic characterization of dextransucrase (DSRBCB4) gene in Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299CB4.
AB  - A gene encoding a dextransucrase (dsrBCB4) that synthesizes only alpha-1,6-linked dextran was cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299CB4. The coding region consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4,395 bp that coded a 1,465-amino-acids protein with a molecular mass 163,581 Da. The expressed recombinant DSRBCB4 (rDSRBCB4) synthesized oligosaccharides in the presence maltose or isomaltose as an acceptor, plus the products included alpha-1,6-linked glucosyl residues in addition to the maltosyl or isomaltosyl residue. Alignments of the amino acid sequence of DSRBCB4 with glucansucrases from Streptococcus and Leuconostoc identified conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic core that are critical for enzyme activity. The mutants D530N, E568Q, and D641N displayed a 98- to 10,000-fold reduction of total enzyme activity.
TI  - Fate and effects of Camembert cheese micro-organisms in the human colonic microbiota of healthy volunteers after regular Camembert consumption.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine i) if Camembert cheese micro-organisms could be detected in fecal samples after regular consumption by human subjects and ii) the consequence of this consumption on global metabolic activities of the host colonic microbiota. An open human protocol was designed where 12 healthy volunteers were included: a 2-week period of fermented products exclusion followed by a 4-weeks Camembert ingestion period where 2x40 g/day of Camembert cheese was consumed. Stools were collected from the volunteers before consumption, twice during the ingestion period (2nd and 4th week) and once after a wash out period of 2 weeks. During the consumption of Camembert cheese, high levels of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were measured in fecal samples using real-time quantitative PCR, reaching median values of 8.2 and 7.5 Log(10) genome equivalents/g of stool. For Ln. mesenteroides, persistence was observed 15 days after the end of Camembert consumption. The survival of Geotrichum candidum was also assessed and the fecal concentration reached a median level of 7.1 Log(10) CFU/g in stools. Except a decreasing trend of the nitrate reductase activity, no significant modification was shown in the metabolic activities during this study.
TI  - Probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and Streptococcus thermophilus  induce IL-12 and IFN-gamma production.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the capacity of potentially probiotic strains from six bacterial genera to induce cytokine production alone or in combinations in order to identify potential enhancing or synergistic effects in order to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes. METHODS: Cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to stimulation with eleven different potentially probiotic bacterial strains from Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Propionibacterium genera was analysed. Production and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were determined by ELISA and Northern blotting, respectively. RESULTS: All tested bacteria induced TNF-alpha production. The best inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma were Streptococcus and Leuconostoc strains. All Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium strains induced higher IL-10 production than other studied bacteria. Stimulation of PBMC with any bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production suggesting that different bacteria whether gram-positive or gram-negative compete with each other during host cell interactions. CONCLUSION: The probiotic S. thermophilus and Leuconostoc strains are more potent inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma than the probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production.
TI  - Binding of bivalent cations by hyaluronate in aqueous solution.
AB  - The interaction between sodium hyaluronate and bivalent cations was investigated  by conductometry, viscosimetry, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is shown that the hyaluronate chains (Mn approximately 4.0 x 10(5)-1.7 x 10(6)g/mol) bind various bivalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+) at pH 6 in aqueous solutions. Hyaluronate deriving from Streptococcus equi was studied in comparison with dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides which was shown to develop no specific interactions with the bivalent cations. The molar relation between the bivalent cations and the disaccharide units of the resulting complex was determined with the result that one bivalent cation is bound by approximately five disaccharide units. Heavy metal ions (Cd2+, Pb2+) seem to bind stronger to the hyaluronate chain than their lighter counterparts (Ca2+, Mg2+). Circular dichroism spectra of the hyaluronate exhibit a cation-induced change in the n-pi* transition, indicating that the acetamide group of the aminoglucane unit is involved during the complexation. NMR spectra of hyaluronic acid in presence of paramagnetic manganese cations show strong interactions between the acetamide as well as the carboxylate groups and the cations. Based on these data, a structure of the binding complex is proposed which involves two disaccharide units.
TI  - Effect of Leuconostoc spp. on the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - Insoluble glucans synthesized by Streptococcus mutans enhance the pathogenicity of oral biofilm by promoting the adherence and accumulation of cariogenic bacteria on the surface of the tooth. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Leuconostoc spp. on the in vitro formation of S. mutans biofilm. Three strains, Leuconostoc gelidum ATCC 49366, Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris ATCC 19254 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293, were used in this study. They exhibited profound inhibitory effects on the formation of S. mutans biofilm and on the proliferation of S. mutans. The water-soluble polymers produced from sucrose were most strongly produced by L. gelidum, followed by L. mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and L. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides. The mean wet weights of the artificial biofilm of S. mutans were also significantly reduced as a result of the addition of the water-soluble polymers obtained from Leuconostoc cultures. According to the results of thin-layer chromatographic analysis, the hydrolysates of the water-soluble polymers produced by Leuconostoc were identical to those of dextran T-2000, forming predominately alpha-(1-6) glucose linkages. These results indicate that dextran-producing Leuconostoc strains are able to inhibit the formation of S. mutans biofilm in vitro.
TI  - An overview of purification methods of glycoside hydrolase family 70 dextransucrase.
AB  - The enzyme dextransucrase (sucrose:1, 6-alpha-D-glucan 6-alpha-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.5) catalyses the synthesis of exopolysaccharide, dextran from sucrose. This class of polysaccharide has been extensively exploited in pharmaceutical industry as blood volume expander, as stabiliser in food industry and as a chromatographic medium in fine chemical industry because of their nonionic nature and stability. Majority of the dextrans are synthesized from sucrose by dextransucrase secreted mainly by bacteria belonging to genera Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Bulk of the information on purification of extracellular dextransucrase has been generated from Leuconostoc species. Various methods such as precipitation by ammonium sulphate, ethanol or polyethylene glycol, phase partitioning, ultrafiltration and chromatography have been used to purify the enzyme. Purification of dextransucrase is rendered difficult by the presence of viscous dextran in the medium. However, processes like ultra-filtration, salt and PEG precipitation, chromatography and phase partitioning have been standardized and successfully used for higher scale purification of the enzyme. A recombinant dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512F with a histidine tag has been expressed in E. coli cells and purifi ed by immobilized metal ion chromatography. This review reports the available information on purifi cation methods of dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains.
TI  - Novel transglucosylating reaction of sucrose phosphorylase to carboxylic compounds such as benzoic acid.
AB  - We examined the synthesis of benzoyl glucoside using the transglucosylation reaction of sucrose phosphorylase. Sucrose phosphorylase from Streptococcus mutans showed marked transglucosylating activity, particularly under acidic conditions. On the other hand, sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed very weak transglucosylating activity. Three main products were detected from the reaction mixture using benzoic acid as an acceptor molecule and sucrose as a donor molecule. These compounds were identified as 1-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside, 2-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranose and 2-O-benzoyl beta-D-glucopyranose on the basis of their isolation and the isolation of their acetylated products and subsequent analysis using 1D- and 2D-NMR analyses. From the results of the time-course analyses of the enzyme reaction and the degradation of 1-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside, 1-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside was considered to be initially produced by the transglucosylation reaction of the enzyme, and 2-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranose and 2-O-benzoyl beta-D-glucopyranose were produced from 1-O-benzoyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside by intramolecular acyl migration reaction. The acceptor specificity in the glucosylation reaction of S. mutans sucrose phosphorylase was also investigated. This sucrose phosphorylase could transglucosylate toward various carboxylic compounds. Short-chain fatty acids, hydroxy acids and dicarboxylic acids were also glucosylated with this sucrose phosphorylase.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  - A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Conserved repeat motifs and glucan binding by glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - Glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have a common pattern of structural organization and characteristically contain a domain with a series of tandem amino acid repeats in which certain residues are highly conserved, particularly aromatic amino acids and glycine. In some glucosyltransferases (GTFs) the repeat region has been identified as a glucan binding domain (GBD). Such GBDs are also found in several glucan binding proteins (GBP) of oral streptococci that do not have glucansucrase activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of 20 glucansucrases and GBP showed the widespread conservation of the 33-residue A repeat first identified in GtfI of Streptococcus downei. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual highly conserved residues in recombinant GBD of GtfI demonstrated the importance of the first tryptophan and the tyrosine-phenylalanine pair in the binding of dextran, as well as the essential contribution of a basic residue (arginine or lysine). A microplate binding assay was developed to measure the binding affinity of recombinant GBDs. GBD of GtfI was shown to be capable of binding glucans with predominantly alpha-1,3 or alpha-1,6 links, as well as alternating alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 links (alternan). Western blot experiments using biotinylated dextran or alternan as probes demonstrated a difference between the binding of streptococcal GTF and GBP and that of Leuconostoc glucansucrases. Experimental data and bioinformatics analysis showed that the A repeat motif is distinct from the 20-residue CW motif, which also has conserved aromatic amino acids and glycine and which occurs in the choline-binding proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other organisms.
TI  - Modified oligosaccharides as potential dental plaque control materials.
AB  - Metabolic acids produced by oral pathogens demineralize tooth surfaces, leading to dental caries. Glucosyltransferases are the key factor in this process. We synthesized various modified oligosaccharides and tested them for their inhibitory effects on glucosyltransferase activity. Oligosaccharides were produced using a mixed-culture fermentation of Lipomyces starkeyi and Leuconostoc mesenteroides and then further modified as iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides. Iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides reduced glucosyltransferase activity of Streptococci from 17% to 43% and prevented the formation of insoluble biomass on the surface of glass vials or stainless steel wires in the presence of sucrose. They also reduced the growth and acid productions of oral pathogens including S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcmitans.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Effect of carbohydrate fatty acid esters on Streptococcus sobrinus and glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  - Mutans streptococci are oral bacteria with a key role in the initiation of dental caries, because their glucosyltransferases synthesize polysaccharides from sucrose that allow them to colonize the tooth surface. Among the strategies to prevent dental caries that are being investigated are (1) the inhibition of bacterial growth of mutans streptococci or (2) the inhibition of glucosyltransferases involved in polysaccharide formation. Pure fatty acid esters of sucrose, maltose and maltotriose were synthesized by an enzyme-catalyzed process and tested as inhibitors of two glucosyltransferases of great homology, those from Streptococcus sobrinus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F. In spite of having their nonreducing end glucose blocked at 6-OH, they did not inhibit dextran synthesis. However, their effect on the growth of S. sobrinus in the solid and liquid phase was notable. 6-O-Lauroylsucrose, 6'-O-lauroylmaltose and 6"-O-lauroylmaltotriose at 100 microg/mL showed complete inhibition of S. sobrinus in agar plates. Consequently, these nontoxic derivatives are very promising for inclusion in oral-hygiene products aimed at disrupting plaque formation and preventing caries.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - [Department of Biochemistry of Microorganisms--start of the path (1951-1973)].
AB  - Creation of the Department of Biochemistry of Microorganisms at the Institute of  Microbiology and Virology of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR in the 30's of the last century was determined by a necessity of profound investigation of vital activity biochemism of microorganisms from various systematic groups which were studied in microbiological department of the Institute. Such complexity can explain certain diversity of the Department research at initial stages of its existence. The research of saccharose transformation into dextran Leuconostoc mesenteroides, when production solutions become slingy at sugar-refinaries, was one of the first most significant works of the Department. The enzyme saccharose-glycosyl-transferase performing this process was described for the first time. A cycle of works on the study of enzymes splitting lactose in milk under the effect of Streptococcus lactis has been carried out. Complex investigation of a number of proteins, polysaccharides, enzymes in enterobacteria has shown that the blocking of the enzyme aldolase is one of the reasons of alkali formation. A method has been developed for isolation of arenarin, antibiotic of plant origin, from sandy everlasting, the nature of its acting basis has been established. Nufarin, an active antibiotic, was isolated from the roots of white water lily when studying nitrogen fixation processes, special attention was given to interaction of hydrogenase and enzymes, taking part in nitrogen fixation, to the effect of ATP on these processes, ways of its synthesis, localization of ATPase in the cell membranes. Works on the study of lypopolysaccharides and polysaccharides of Gram-negative enterobacteria, bacteria of Pseudomonas genus were started with the purpose to use the obtained data to specify systematic propositions of the investigated microorganisms. Further on these works became the basis of thematic department. There are numerous reviews dedicated to their development.
TI  - Feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations Actimel and Indian Dahi.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. The design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the Delhi University College Hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre Nand Nagri, a resettlement colony in East Delhi. Children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. Group 1 was given a fermented milk, Actimel, containing 10(8) of each Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per gram. Group 2 was given Indian Dahi (Lf 40) containing 10(8) of each Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus lactis cremoris and Leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. Group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). Actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. In the hospital study Indian Dahi and Actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3 and 0.6 day (P<0.001), respectively. The corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (P<0.05), respectively. The families using Actimel as a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. In conclusion, Actimel, fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, and Indian Dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of foodborne Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. against Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The saprophytic Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. Culture supernatants of 200 strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against C. botulinum type A, proteolytic type B, and type E strains in a well diffusion assay. Nineteen strains were positive against C. botulinum. Among those, seven Paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against C. botulinum strains. The antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive P. polymyxa strains. The antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees C and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees C in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In co-cultures with the positive strain of P. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a C. botulinum type E strain was inhibited whenever P. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before C. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. The antimicrobial activity of P. polymyxa against C. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. Other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Dynamics of the microbial community responsible for traditional sour cassava starch fermentation studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative rRNA hybridization.
AB  - The microbial community developing during the spontaneous fermentation of sour cassava starch was investigated by cultivation-independent methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partially amplified 16S rDNA followed by sequencing of the most intense bands showed that the dominant organisms were all lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly close relatives of Bifidobacterium minimum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus saccharolyticus and Lactobacillus plantarum., Close relatives of Lb. panis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Ln. citreum were also found. A complementary analysis using hybridization of 16S rRNA with phylogenetic probes was necessary to detect the presence of the recently discovered species Lb. manihotivorans. Although it represented up to 13% of the total lactic acid bacteria of sour cassava starch, this species could not be detected by DGGE as the PCR product migrated to the same position as Lc. lactis. In addition, it was shown that a strong pH decrease in the time course of fermentation was most probably responsible for the competitive selection of acid-resistant LAB vs. both homo and heterofermentative acid-sensitive LAB.
TI  - Assessment of acid production by various human oral micro-organisms when palatinose or leucrose is utilized.
AB  - One promising way of reducing caries is by using sucrose substitutes in food, e.g., palatinose or leucrose. Previous experiments addressing cariogenic potential of sucrose substitutes have focused mainly on Streptococcus mutans. However, given the many other micro-organisms in the oral cavity, this study compared the acid production of 100 bacterial strains representing 44 different species, by batch fermentation in a test tube containing, as a sole carbohydrate source, glucose, sucrose, palatinose, or leucrose. Selected strains were further analyzed in a fermenter. Additionally, 30 yeast strains were tested by an auxanographic sugar assimilation test. Only Lactobacillus spp., Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella paramesenteroides, and some of the yeasts studied-i.e., Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae-utilized leucrose and/or palatinose well. Strikingly, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus produced water-insoluble polysaccharides by fermentation of leucrose and palatinose. In the fermenter, the respective sucrose substitutes were not only cleaved but also utilized. Thus, extracellular cleavage by autochthonous micro-organisms may produce cariogenic cleavage products (glucose, fructose) that can be used by other well-characterized cariogenic bacteria found in the oral flora. Therefore, the anticariogenic potential of sucrose substitutes in food might be limited.
TI  - The microbiology of South African traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A total of 15 samples of traditional fermented milk were collected from individual households in South Africa and Namibia. Lactic acid bacteria dominated the microflora of these samples, especially the genera Leuconostoc, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus. Other groups identified included pyogenic streptococci and enterococci. The dominant lactococci species was Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Eighty-three percent of the leuconostoc isolates were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. Other species identified included Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - Location of repeat elements in glucansucrases of Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species.
AB  - Glucosyltransferases of oral streptococci, dextransucrases and alternansucrase of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, collectively referred to as glucansucrases, are large extracellular enzymes that synthesise glucans with a variety of structures and properties. A characteristic of all these glucansucrases is the possession of a C-terminal domain consisting of a series of tandem amino acid repeats. These repeat units are thought to interact with glucan but closely resemble the cell wall binding domain motif found in choline binding proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae and surface-located proteins in a range of other bacteria. Analysis of dextransucrase and alternansucrase sequences has now shown that they also contain these repeat motifs in the N-terminal region, raising questions about their evolutionary origin and functional importance.
TI  - Involvement of Gln937 of Streptococcus downei GTF-I glucansucrase in transition-state stabilization.
AB  - Multiple alignment of deduced amino-acid sequences of glucansucrases (glucosyltransferases and dextransucrases) from oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides has shown them to share a well-conserved catalytic domain. A portion of this domain displays homology to members of the alpha-amylase family (glycoside hydrolase family 13), which all have a (beta/alpha)8 barrel structure. In the glucansucrases, however, the alpha-helix and beta-strand elements are circularly permuted with respect to the order in family 13. Previous work has shown that amino-acid residues contributing to the active site of glucansucrases are situated in structural elements that align with those of family 13. In alpha-amylase and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, a histidine residue has been identified that acts to stabilize the transition state, and a histidine is conserved at the corresponding position in all other members of family 13. In all the glucansucrases, however, the aligned position is occupied by glutamine. Mutants of glucosyltransferase I were constructed in which this glutamine, Gln937, was changed to histidine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, asparagine or alanine. The effects on specific activity, ability to form glucan and ability to transfer glucose to a maltose acceptor were examined. Only histidine could substitute for glutamine and maintain Michaelis-Menten kinetics, albeit at a greatly reduced kcat, showing that Gln937 plays a functionally equivalent role to the histidine in family 13. This provides additional evidence in support of the proposed alignment of the (beta/alpha)8 barrel structures. Mutation at position 937 altered the acceptor reaction with maltose, and resulted in the synthesis of novel gluco-oligosaccharides in which alpha1,3-linked glucosyl units are joined sequentially to maltose.
TI  - Mutagenesis of asp-569 of glucosyltransferase I glucansucrase modulates glucan and oligosaccharide synthesis.
AB  - Glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides are enzymes of  medical and biotechnological interest that synthesize alpha-glucans. They can also synthesize oligosaccharides in the presence of a sugar acceptor. Previous reports have identified an amino acid residue that may affect the structure of the glucan product; therefore, random mutagenesis of the corresponding Asp-569 of Streptococcus downei glucosyltransferase I (GTF-I) was used to further understanding of its involvement in the catalytic mechanism and to evaluate how different amino acids can modulate glucan and oligosaccharide synthesis. GTF-I variants were obtained where Asp-569 was replaced by each of the different possible classes of amino acids. These were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by means of a His(6) tag. The results showed that the amino acid in position 569 influences the structure of the glucan and the size of the oligosaccharides produced by GTF-I. The results suggest that the amino acid occupying this position is more likely to interact with the acceptor molecules (oligosaccharides or elongating glucan chain) than to be directly involved in glucosyl transfer from sucrose. Engineering of the equivalent position in glucansucrases thus appears to be a good target to expand the range of oligosaccharides synthesized.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. This reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. In recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. To understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and the species Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus but absent in L. lactis, Leu. mesenteroides, and S. thermophilus. Nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. A strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. Most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. In two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Isolation of key amino acid residues at the N-terminal end of the core region Streptococcus downei glucansucrase, GTF-I.
AB  - Related streptococcal and Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucansucrases are enzymes of medical and biotechnological interest. Molecular modelling has suggested that the catalytic domain contains a circularly permuted version of the (beta/alpha)8 barrel structure found in the amylase superfamily, and site-directed mutagenesis has identified critical amino acids in this region. In this study, sequential N-terminal truncations of Streptococcus downei GTF-I showed that key amino acids are also present in the first one-third of the core domain. Mutations were introduced at Trp-344, Glu-349 and His-355, residues that are conserved in all glucansucrases and lie within a region which is a target for inhibitory antibodies. W344L, E349L and H355V substitutions were assayed for their effect on mutan synthesis and also on oligosaccharide synthesis with various acceptors. It appeared that Trp-344 and His-355 are involved in the action mechanism of GTF-I; His-355 may also play a role in a binding subsite necessary for oligosaccharide and glucan elongation.
TI  - Secondary structure of Streptococcus downei GTF-1 glucansucrase.
AB  - Multiple sequence alignment and structure prediction of glucansucrases produced by oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed that all have common structural features, with three major domains. There is no conservation of primary sequence or structure in the N-terminal variable region. Sequence-based structure prediction combined with circular dichroism spectrum analysis of purified truncated forms of Streptococcus downei GTF-I revealed that the core catalytic region has a defined structure consistent with the proposed (alpha/beta)8-barrel structure. The C-terminal domain is a mixed structure with significant amounts of beta-sheet and random-coil. This information contributes to the development of our understanding of structure-function relationships in glucansucrases.
TI  - Glucansucrases: mechanism of action and structure-function relationships.
AB  - Glucansucrases are produced principally by Leuconostoc mesenteroides and oral Streptococcus species, but also by the lactic acid bacteria (Lactococci, Lactobacilli). They catalyse the synthesis of high molecular weight D-glucose polymers, named glucans, from sucrose. In the presence of efficient acceptors, they catalyse the synthesis of low molecular weight oligosaccharides. Glucosidic bond synthesis occurs without the mediation of nucleotide activated sugars and cofactors are not necessary. Glucansucrases have an industrial value because of the production of dextrans and oligosaccharides and a biological importance by their key role in the cariogenic process. They were identified more than 50 years ago. The first glucansucrase encoding gene was cloned more than 10 years ago. But the mechanism of their action remains incompletely understood. However, in order to synthesise oligosaccharides of biological interest or to develop vaccines against dental caries, elucidation of the factors determining the regiospecificity and the regioselectivity of glucansucrases is necessary. The cloning of glucansucrase encoding genes in addition to structure-function relationship studies have allowed the identification of important amino acid residues and have shown that glucansucrases are composed of two functional domains: a core region (ca. 1000 amino acids) involved in sucrose binding and splitting and a C-terminal domain (ca. 500 amino acids) composed of a series of tandem repeats involved in glucan binding. Enzymology studies have enabled different models for their action mechanism to be proposed. The use of secondary structure prediction has led to a clearer knowledge of structure-function relationships of glucansucrases. However, mainly due to the large size of these enzymes, data on the three-dimensional structure of glucansucrases (given by crystallography and modelling) remain necessary to clearly identify those features which determine function.
TI  - The effect of dietary fatty acids on lactic acid bacteria associated with the epithelial mucosa and from faecalia of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.).
AB  - Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), held in fresh water, were fed four experimental diets containing different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In addition, one group fed a diet containing only coconut oil as sole lipid source served as control. The population of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria associated with the epithelial mucosa and the faecalia was estimated using the dilution plate technique. Generally, the population level of adherent bacteria increased along the digestive tract (stomach, small intestine and large intestine). Adherent Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria seemed to be present at equal levels in all parts of the alimentary tract. Lactic acid bacteria dominated among the Gram-positive bacteria, and they were detected in all regions of fish fed the PUFA supplemented diets. The frequency of lactic acid bacteria was highest in the digestive tract of fish fed diets with added 7.0% linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) or 4% of a PUFA mix. A lower frequency of lactic acid bacteria was found in fish fed dietary linoleic acid (18:2 n-6), and they were absent or present in low numbers in fish fed the coconut oil diet. It is suggested that dietary fatty acids affect the attachment sites for the gastrointestinal microbiota, possibly by modifying the fatty acid composition of the intestine wall. Numerical taxonomy procedures showed that the lactic acid bacteria Carnobacterium spp. and a Carnobacterium piscicola-like strain were predominant, with smaller numbers of Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus spp. and Leuconostoc mesenteroides present. Seven strains of Carnobacterium spp. were further identified on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and all these strains were identified as Carnobacterium piscicola.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene coding for an extracellular dextransucrase (DSRB) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 synthesizing only a alpha (1-6) glucan.
AB  - The coding region for a novel Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 dextransucrase gene (dsrB) was isolated and sequenced. Using degenerate primers homologous to a conserved region present in dextransucrases from Streptococcus (GTFs) and L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F (DSRS) and conserved amino acid sequences located in the N-terminal catalytic region of these enzymes, about 60% of the DSRB encoding gene was isolated. Two sites, BamHI and HindIII, were identified which allowed one 0.5-kbp probe to be obtained to isolate the 5' and the 3' ends of dsrB. The nucleotide sequence of the dsrB gene was determined and found to consist of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4521 base pairs (bp) coding for a 1507-amino acid protein with an M1 of 168,511. The amino acid sequence is very close to that of DSRS. Like DSRS, the dextran produced appeared to be composed of only alpha (1-6) glucosidic bonds, and the oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of acceptor maltose were also composed of alpha (1-6) linked glucosyl residues in addition to the maltosyl residue. DSRB thus appears to be a novel dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1299. DSRB produces a dextran different from the typical dextran containing alpha (1-6) and alpha (1-2) linkages produced when this strain is grown in the presence of sucrose.
TI  - Glucan binding regions of dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F.
AB  - We isolated glucan-binding peptides of a dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512F. The dextransucrase was bound to DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G-100, and mutan from Streptococcus mutans. Mild trypsin digestion dissociated the enzyme and glucan binding. In the presence of ammonium sulfate, several peptides were bound to glucan after trypsin digestion. Four main mutan-binding peptides were obtained by this method, and those amino acid sequences were analyzed. One of them was identical with the dextran-binding peptide that contains lysine, which was previously isolated by differential chemical modification with o-phthalaldehyde. We also found mutan-binding peptides in sucrose- and dextran-binding regions and a lysine-rich region. Also, there was a peptide similar in sequence to glucan-binding A-repeat of streptococcal glucosyltransferases.
TI  - Adsorption of Streptococcus sobrinus dextranase inhibitor to water-insoluble alpha-D-glucans of oral streptococci.
AB  - A low molecular weight dextranase inhibitor from Streptococcus sobrinus has previously been identified and purified. The range of conditions under which inhibition occurs, and the situations in which dextranase activity of S. sobrinus can reappear, have been examined in the chemostat. These studies have revealed that when dextranase production exceeds that of the inhibitor, all the inhibitor is tightly bound into enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and the excess enzyme remains active. Another factor that influences the activity of dextranase inhibitor has now been identified, namely the ability of the inhibitor to bind to water-insoluble glucans. Adsorption to water-insoluble alpha-D-glucans, produced by oral streptococci that were grown in batch culture, increased with their proportion of alpha-1,3-linked sequences of glucose residues. Studies with water-insoluble dextrans of Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains showed that alpha-1,6-linked sequences were also important for binding. The inhibitor was not active when adsorbed to glucan, but active inhibitor was released by incubation with soluble dextran. The interactions of sucrose, alpha-D-glucosyltransferases, alpha-D-glucans, dextranase and dextranase inhibitor are discussed in relation to the growth rate of S. sobrinus. At low growth rate in the chemostat the predominant alpha-D-glucosyltransferase (GTF) is a GTF-S that converts sucrose into soluble dextran, and the activity of free dextranase inhibitor in the culture filtrate is high. By contrast, at high growth rate the streptococci produce GTFs capable of synthesizing water-insoluble alpha-D-glucans, and no free inhibitor is found in culture filtrate. Thus the activity of free, extracellular dextranase inhibitor is controlled by (i) the extent of binding to dextranase and (ii) the extent of adsorption to water-insoluble alpha-D-glucan.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene coding for a novel dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 synthesizing only alpha (1-6) and alpha (1-3) linkages.
AB  - The coding region for a Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 dextransucrase gene (dsrA) was isolated and sequenced. Using a pair of primers designed on the basis of two highly conserved amino-acid (aa) sequences in L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F dextransucrase and streptococcal glucosyltransferases (GTFs), a fragment of dsrA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This PCR product was used as an hybridization probe to isolate a 1.8-kb fragment identified as the central region of dsrA. Cleavage by Sac I of this fragment allowed two probes to be obtained to isolate the 5' and the 3' ends of dsrA. The nucleotide sequence of the dsrA gene was determined and found to consist of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4870 base pairs (bp) coding for a 1290-aa protein with an M(r) of 145590. The aa sequence exhibited a high similarity with other GTFs. The two domains previously described in GTFs are conserved in DSRA: an N-terminal conserved domain and a C-terminal domain composed of a series of repeats. Surprisingly, the expected signal peptide was not detected. The entire gene was reconstructed and the activity of DSRA was investigated. The dextran produced appeared to be composed of 85% alpha (1-6) and 15% alpha (1-3) linkages and the oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of maltose were mainly composed of alpha (1-6) linkages. This enzyme is a novel dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 producing no alpha (1-2) linkages and is the first glucosyltransferase having no signal peptide described.
TI  - Lactic acid fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima.
AB  - The souring of cassava dough during fermentation into the fermented cassava meal, agbelima, was investigated. Four different types of traditional inocula were used to ferment the dough and increases in titrable acidity expressed as lactic acid from 0.31-0.38 to 0.78-0.91% (w/w) confirmed the fermentation to be a process of acidification. The microflora of all inocula and fermenting dough contained high counts of lactic acid bacteria, 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g in all inocula and 10(7)-10(8), 10(8)-10(9) and 10(9) cfu/g at 0, 24 and 48 h in all fermentations. Lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during all types of fermentation accounting for 51% of 171 representative isolates taken from various stages of fermentation. Other major lactic acid bacteria found were Lactobacillus brevis, 16%, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15% and some cocci including Streptococcus spp. whose numbers decreased with fermentation time. The lactic acid bacteria were responsible for the souring of agbelima through the production of lactic acid. All L. plantarum, L. brevis and L. mesenteroides isolates examined demonstrated linamarase as well as other enzymatic activities but did not possess tissue degrading enzymes like cellulase, pectin esterase and polygalacturonase. The aroma profile of agbelima did not vary with the type of inoculum used and in all samples the build-up of aroma compounds were dominated by a non-identified low molecular weight alcohol, 1-propanol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetoin. Substantial reductions occurred in the levels of cyanogenic compounds present in cassava during fermentation into agbelima and detoxification was enhanced by the use of inoculum.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of sucrose phosphorylase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165.
AB  - The sucrose phosphorylase gene of an isolate, Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165,  was amplified by PCR, cloned on pUC118, and expressed in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the gene showed 96.3% similarity to that of L. mesenteroides ATCC12291 and 67% to that of Streptococcus mutans, but low similarity to the Agrobacterium vitis gene. The cloned gene, which fusing with lacZalpha, was expressed inducibly with IPTG in E. coli to produce an active enzyme in large quantities that accounted for about 50% of the total cell protein.
TI  - Aggregated form of dextransucrases from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F and its constitutive mutant.
AB  - Purified dextransucrases [EC 2.4.1.5], DSW-D and DSW-G, from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512F were obtained from affinity chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 by elution with clinical dextran and guanidine-HCl, respectively. DSM-G was purified from the B-512F mutant strain SH 3002, which produces dextransucrase constitutively. Although the sugar contents of the purified enzymes were different, their molecular masses by SDS-PAGE were all 170 kDa. DSW-D and DSW-G were highly aggregated and the all the activities were eluted at the void volume (V0) on Sepharose 6B, while the DSM-G was eluted at 1.2 x V0 volume. On rechromatography, DSM-G was separated into three peaks corresponding to the aggregated form, monomeric form, and partially digested form, respectively. The aggregation of Leuconostoc dextransucrase was looser than that of streptococcal glucosyltransferases, but the structures of these enzymes had high homology with each other.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented Greek  dry salami.
AB  - A total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. The majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus Weissella (120), which was recently proposed (Collins et al., 1993) to include Leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. Meat streptobacteria were identified as Lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and L. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable and, thus designated L. sake/curvatus. Non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as L. plantarum (34 strains), L. farciminis (10), L. coryniformis (1) and L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). The majority of the Weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as W. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described W. hellenica (Collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled W. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. The latter group comprised strains that produced D(L)-lactate. The remaining Weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to W. minor (31) and W. halotolerans (3). Other species identified were Enterococcus faecium (10), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), L. brevis (1) and Pediococcus sp. (1). The main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
TI  - Natural instability of Agrobacterium vitis Ti plasmid due to unusual duplication  of a 2.3-kb DNA fragment.
AB  - The octopine/cucumopine (o/c) Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium vitis carry two T regions, TA and TB. The TA region resembles the octopine TL region. The TB region contains the auxin synthesis genes TB-iaaM and TB-iaaH and the cucumopine synthesis gene cus. Within the group of o/c isolates, strains 2608 and 2641 are closely related. However, 2641 lacks the TB region. The restriction maps of pTi2608 and pTi2641 were established and showed that the TB deletion resulted from intramolecular recombination between two directly repeated sequences separated by 66 kb in pTi2608. The 2,294-bp repeated sequence lacks inverted repeats and does not duplicate its target site, indicating that it is not a classical bacterial insertion sequence (IS element). It was therefore called an RSAv element (repeated sequence of A. vitis). The RSAv element carries two open reading frames: ORF234 is homologous to the traR gene of the A. tumefaciens nopaline Ti plasmid pTiC58; ORF488 is homologous to the sucrose phosphorylase gene of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and the glucosyl transferase A gene of Streptococcus mutans. The RSAv repeat starts precisely at the start codon of ORF488 and ends two base pairs 3' of the stop codon of ORF234. The structural organization of the RSAv element suggests that the amplification event did not result from a random amplification process. A study of the distribution of the two RSAv copies (RSAv-1 and RSAv-2) in pTi2608 and other o/c isolates indicates that the ancestor o/c Ti plasmid contained only RSAv-1 and that this sequence was duplicated at one point during the divergent evolution of the o/c Ti plasmids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - An active-site peptide containing the second essential carboxyl group of dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides by chemical modifications.
AB  - The treatment of Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512F dextransucrase with 10 mM 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC) and glycine ethyl ester (GEE) inactivated the enzyme almost completely within 24 min where the modification of one carboxyl group/mol of the enzyme by EDC was attained. Though 30 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) also inactivated the enzyme, about 35% of the activity remained during a 36-min incubation. When 10 mol of imidazole residues/mol of the enzyme was modified by DEP, 50% of the activity was still retained. The addition of the substrate sucrose greatly retarded the enzyme inactivation by EDC. However, the addition of dextran slightly protected the inactivation of the glucosyl-transferring activity and accelerated the inactivation of the sucrose-cleaving activity. In the case of DEP, the addition of sucrose or dextran gave no influence on the inactivation of the enzyme. Therefore, the carboxyl group seemed to play a more important role in the substrate binding and in the catalytic activity of the dextransucrase than the imidazolium group. Differential labeling of Leuconostoc dextransucrase by EDC was conducted in the presence of a sucrose analog, sucrose monocaprate. The fluorescent probe N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (EDAN) was used as the nucleophile instead of GEE. A fluorescent labeled peptide was isolated from a trypsin digest of the EDC-EDAN modified enzyme. The amino acid sequence of the isolated peptide was Leu-Gln-Glu-Asp-Asn-Ser-Asn-Val-Val-Val-Glu-Ala.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
TI  - Maltodextrin acceptor reactions of Streptococcus mutans 6715 glucosyltransferases.
AB  - The maltodextrin (maltose through maltoheptaose) acceptor reactions of two Streptococcus mutans 6715 glucosyltransferases (GTF-I and GTF-S) were studied. The acceptor product structures were determined by comparing them with the known structures of the acceptor products of Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512FM dextransucrase (EC 2.4.1.5) and L. mesenteroides B-1355 alternansucrase (EC 2.4.1.140). When reacted with maltose (G2), both GTF-I and GTF-S transferred a D-glucopyranose from sucrose to the nonreducing glucosyl residue to give panose (6(2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl maltose). Panose then served as an acceptor to give two further acceptor products, 6(2)-alpha-isomaltosyl maltose and 6(2)-alpha-nigerosyl maltose. 6(2)-alpha-Isomaltosyl maltose then went on to serve as an acceptor to give a series of homologous acceptor products with isomaltodextrin chains attached to C-6 of the nonreducing-end residue of maltose, while 6(2)-alpha-nigerosyl maltose did not further react. When reacted with other maltodextrins (G3-G7), both GTF-I and GTF-S transferred a D-glucopyranose to C-6 of either the nonreducing-end or the reducing-end residues of the maltodextrins, forming alpha(1----6) linkages. When D-glucopyranose was transferred to the nonreducing-end residue by GTF-I or GTF-S, the first product was also an acceptor to give the second product, which then served as an acceptor to give the third product, etc., to give a homologous series of products. When D-glucopyranose was transferred to the reducing-end residue, the acceptor product that formed did not readily serve as an acceptor, or served only as a very poor acceptor, to give a small amount of the next homologue, as was the case for G7 with GTF-S. In addition, GTF-I also transferred D-glucopyranose to the reducing-end or to the nonreducing-end residue of maltotriose, forming alpha(1----3) linkages, to give 3(3)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl maltotriose and 3(1)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl maltotriose. Neither of these acceptor products further served as acceptors to give a homologous series. Under equivalent conditions of equimolar amounts of acceptor and sucrose, maltose and maltotriose are much better acceptors with GTF-I than they are with GTF-S, which is better than L. mesenteroides B-512FM dextransucrase. The three enzymes display significantly different efficiencies for the different maltodextrin acceptor reactions, GTF-I and GTF-S having much higher efficiencies than L. mesenteroides B-512FM dextransucrase.
TI  - Purification and some properties of sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - Sucrose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.7) was purified to homogeneity from Leuconostoc mesenteroides cells with a specific activity of 173.8 units per mg protein by ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange HPLC on TSKgel DEAE-5PW, and hydrophobic HPLC on TSKgel Ether-5PW. The purified enzyme was an acidic protein having an isoelectric point of pH 4.6 and s0(20),W of 4.34S. The molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be 56,400 by sedimentation equilibrium, 55,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and HPLC gel filtration on TSKgel G3000SW, suggesting that the enzyme is a monomeric protein. With regard to molecular weight, amino acid composition, and N-terminal amino acid sequence of 30 residues, this enzyme is close to the glucosyltransferase A of Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Separation of the poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DSM 20343 into molecular species by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A.
AB  - This study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. The lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738 (I), Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) ATCC 9790 (II), and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DMS 20343 (III). Lipoteichoic acids II and III are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. Lipoteichoic acid I is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. Lipoteichoic acids I and III additionally carry D-alanine ester. Lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-A-Sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. It was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. The chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid I and II vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid III appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). Molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. All lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. Two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.
TI  - Antimutagenicity and binding of lactic acid bacteria from a Chinese cheese to mutagenic pyrolyzates.
AB  - The microbiological characteristics of Nai Ge Da, a traditional cheese in China,  was investigated. The lactic acid bacteria species were identified as Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc paramesenteroides, Leuconostoc dextranicum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Streptococcus cremoris, and Leuconostoc paramesenteroides were the dominant strains. The antimutagenicities and binding of strains of S. cremoris and S. lactic ssp. diacetylactis to mutagenic pyrolyzates was investigated. The lyophilized cells of strains showed the highest inhibitory effect on the 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-[5H]pyrido[4,3-b] indol (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-[5H]pyrido[4,3-b] indol (Trp-P-2), but many strains had no significant inhibition against 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d] imidazole (Glu-P-1). The Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all bacterial cells, but binding of Glu-P-1 to cells was not effective. Among the strains tested, S. cremoris C-25 not only indicated highest binding to Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2, but it also it had a 25.36% binding ability with Glu-P-1. When all strains were autoclaved for 15 min at 120 degrees C, binding ability to mutagens was reduced by 3 to 19%. The decrease of binding ability of S. cremoris C-25 was much less, being only 2%. After heating at 80 degrees C for 3 h, the binding ability of all strains to mutagenic pyrolyzates was not much different from those of parent viable cells.
TI  - Exocellular polysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The production of homopolysaccharides (dextrans, mutans) and heteropolysaccharides by lactic acid bacteria, their chemical composition, their structure and their synthesis are outlined. Mutans streptococci, which include Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus produce soluble and insoluble alpha-glucans. The latter may contain as much as 90% alpha-1-3 linkages and possess a marked ability to promote adherence to the smooth tooth surface causing dental plaque. Dextrans produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides are high molecular weight alpha-glucans having 1-6, 1-4 and 1-3 linkages, varying from slightly to highly branched; 1-6 linkages are predominant. Emphasis is put on exopolysaccharide producing thermophilic and mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, which are important in the dairy industry. The produced polymers play a key role in the rheological behaviour and the texture of fermented milks. One of the main problems in this field is the transitory nature of the thickening trait. This instability is not yet completely understood. Controversial results exist on the sugar composition of the slime produced, but galactose and glucose have always been identified with galactose predominating in most cases.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic characteristics of pediococci.
AB  - Over a 43-month period, 23 separate isolates of nonenterococcal alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci were reported by our clinical microbiology laboratory to be resistant to vancomycin. This constituted 0.32% of nonenterococcal alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci reported and 4.4% of such streptococci upon which susceptibility testing was performed. Of 13 isolates which were available for further study, all were highly resistant to vancomycin (MIC greater than or equal to 1,024 micrograms/ml), but none were actually streptococci. Three were clearly gram-positive rods by Gram stain and were found to be homofermentative lactobacilli. Two strains with elongated gram-positive cocci from colonies on agar showed small gram-positive rods when grown in thioglycolate broth and were physiologically identified as Lactobacillus confusus. Two isolates with lenticular gram-positive cocci appeared to be Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. Six gram-positive isolates with round cells from growth on agar and from broth were arranged in tetrads in broth and closely resembled Pediococcus acidilactici. Twelve additional strains of pediococci that were not of human origin were also found to be highly resistant to vancomycin. These findings confirm published reports of clinical isolation of organisms resembling pediococci and suggest that clinically isolated, vancomycin-resistant bacteria which superficially resemble streptococci are probably other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of 4,6-dideoxysucrose, and inhibition studies of Leuconostoc and Streptococcus D-glucansucrases with deoxy and chloro derivatives of sucrose modified at carbon atoms 3, 4, and 6.
AB  - Starting from sucrose, 2,3,1',3',4',6'-hexa-O-benzoyl-6-deoxy-6-iodosucrose (1) was synthesized. Reaction of 1 with sulfuryl chloride in pyridine gave 2,3,1',3',4',6'-hexa-O-benzoyl-4-chloro-4,6-dideoxy-6-iodogalactosucr ose (2). Compound 2 was treated with tributyltin hydride in toluene in the presence of a radical initiator, alpha, alpha-azobis(isobutanonitrile) (AIBN), to remove iodine and chlorine groups and give hexa-O-benzoyl-4,6-dideoxysucrose. Benzoyl groups were removed by sodium methoxide in methanol to give 4,6-dideoxysucrose. Sucrose was modified at carbon atom 3, carbon atom 4, or carbon atoms 4 and 6, and these analogs were tested as inhibitors of the D-glucansucrases (D-glucosyltransferases) of Streptococcus mutans 6715 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512F. Sucrose analogs used in this study are 4-deoxysucrose and 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose with S. mutans 6715 D-glucansucrases (GTF-S and GTF-I), and 3-deoxysucrose, 4-deoxysucrose, 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose, 6-deoxysucrose, and 4,6-dideoxysucrose with L. mesenteroides B-512F D-glucansucrase. The data indicate that 3-deoxysucrose, 4-deoxysucrose, and 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose are weak noncompetitive inhibitors for B-512F dextransucrase, with Ki values of 530, 201, and 202mM respectively. For the same enzyme, 6-deoxysucrose was a strong competitive inhibitor, with Ki of 1.60mM, and 4,6-dideoxysucrose was a good competitive inhibitor, with Ki of 20.3mM. 4-Deoxysucrose was a weak noncompetitive inhibitor for both GTF-I and GTF-S, with Ki values of 672 and 608mM, respectively. 4-Chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose was also a weak noncompetitive inhibitor for GTF-I and GTF-S with Ki values of 391 and 308mM, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Use of 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy for the quantitative estimation of 3-O- and 3,6-di-O-substituted D-glucopyranosyl residues in alpha-D-glucans formed by the D-glucosyltransferases of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - The 13C-n.m.r. spectra of the three alpha-D-glucans from Streptococcus sobrinus and the dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which differ widely in the ratios of omega (terminal, nonreducing) D-glucopyranosyl groups: 3-:6-:3,6-linked D-glucopyranosyl (Glc) residues, were measured in 0.5M NaOH at 22 degrees. The C-1 signals of 3-O-substituted Glc in a linear sequence, 6-O-substituted Glc in a linear sequence, 3,6-di-O-substituted Glc in a (1----6)-linked sequence, and Glc attached to O-3 of 3,6-di-O-substituted Glc were distinguished from each other. The C-3 signal of 3,6-linked Glc appeared downfield by 0.6 to 1.0 p.p.m. compared to the C-3 signal of 3-linked Glc in a linear sequence. The C-6 signals of omega-terminal, 3-linked, 6-linked, and 3,6-linked Glc were also assigned. The C-2 signal of 3-linked Glc in a linear sequence appeared separately, at 73.76 p.p.m. Based on these assignments, the various D-glucopyranosyl residues of the S. sobrinus alpha-D-glucans were quantitatively estimated from the signal areas of the C-2 atom of 3-linked Glc, the C-3 atom of 3-linked and 3,6-linked Glc, the C-6 atom of 6-linked and 3,6-linked Glc, and the C-6 atom of the omega-Glc groups and 3-linked Glc residues. The figures thus derived for the linkage ratios were close to those obtained by methylation analysis.
TI  - Antitumor activity of lactic acid bacteria on a solid fibrosarcoma, sarcoma-180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
AB  - Antitumor activity of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus lactis was investigated in solid mouse fibrosarcoma. Intratumor administration of lyophilised bacterial cells at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt resulted in the regression of tumors in a maximum number of animals. Intraperitoneal injection at the same dose resulted in a significant increase in the survival time but was ineffective in curing the animals. Intratumor injection of Streptococcus thermophilus at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt also inhibited the growth of fibrosarcoma accompanied by an increase in the survival time while intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus prolonged only the survival time and did not result in cure. In mice bearing the ascitic form of sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus resulted in complete cure in a very significant proportion of tumor-bearing mice. S. thermophilus was more effective in sarcoma-180 than in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The cured tumors did not recur.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria from prepacked meat and meat products.
AB  - Ninety-four strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from refrigerated, prepacked meat and meat products were together with 59 reference strains of Brochothrix, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Streptococcus phenotypically classified, using 96 unit characters. Data were examined using Simple Matching (SSM) or Jaccard coefficient (SJ), and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Twenty-three clusters with two or more members were defined at the 84% SSM-similarity level which corresponded to the SJ-similarity level of 61%. Based on SSM, most field strains were included in nine clusters, and with three unsignificant exceptions these contained no reference strains. The field clusters were designated Carnobacterium piscicola (cluster 1; 5% of field isolates), Carnobacterium divergens (cluster 2; 9% of field isolates), Leuconostoc (cluster 9; 18% of field isolates) and Lactobacillus (cluster 4, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14; together 60% of field isolates). The Lactobacillus clusters had many features in common with cluster II of Shaw & Harding (1984). Phenotypical characteristics of major clusters are given. The SSM and SJ based classifications basically coincided for the field strains; the exception was cluster 4 which now were split in two parts. Fourteen clusters were made up of mainly reference strains (SSM). Most of them included more than one type strain on species level; exceptions were Brochothrix thermosphacta (cluster 3), Lactobacillus salivarius (cluster 17) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (cluster 18). Several rearrangements were seen amongst the clusters of the reference strains when SJ, instead of SSM, was used for clustering.
TI  - Effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial population of Nigerian orange juice.
AB  - The effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial load of Nigerian orange juice was studied over a period of 1 month. Results obtained indicated that pasteurization at 60 degrees and 80 degrees C for 20 to 40 min, freezing at -5 degrees C, and addition of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.4% (w/v) could form a microbiological basis for the preservation of the juice for 1 month. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. paramesenteroides, Streptococcus avium, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the micro-organisms isolated from the untreated and treated juice samples.
TI  - The formation of alpha-D-(1----3) branch linkages by a D-glucansucrase from Streptococcus mutans 6715 producing a soluble D-glucan.
AB  - An exocellular D- glucansucrase that synthesizes a water-soluble, alpha-D-(1----6)-linked D-glucan having a high proportion of alpha-D-(1----3) branches was purified from the culture broth of Streptococcus mutans 6715. The rate of incorporation of D-[14C]glucose from [14C]sucrose into D-glucan of high molecular weight by this enzyme was increased (stimulated) by the presence of exogenous Leuconostoc mesenteroides B- 512F dextran, and it was found that this dextran could act as an acceptor. A highly branched dextran, containing 45-50% of alpha-D-(1----3) branch linkages, did not stimulate the enzyme nearly so much as B- 512F dextran, which has a low degree (5%) of alpha-D-(1----3) branches. We interpret this as evidence that the stimulating effects of dextran are not due to priming. If they were, the more highly branched dextran should have produced the greatest stimulation per unit weight, because a much greater number of nonreducing-end, priming sites would be available. We show that the D- glucansucrase was capable of transferring D-glucosyl groups from sucrose to B- 512F dextran to form alpha-D-(1----3) branches, thereby rendering the dextran more resistant to hydrolysis by endodextranase . The presence of 1.6M ammonium sulfate caused the enzyme to synthesize a D-glucan having a much higher percentage of alpha-D-(1----3) linkages.
TI  - p-Nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside, a new substrate for glucansucrases.
AB  - p-Nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside has been shown to be a substrate for the glucansucrases of various strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus mutans. The products from a digest of p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside with L. mesenteroides B-512F dextransucrase were found to include dextran, a series of p-nitrophenyl isomaltodextrin glycosides, and p-nitrophenyl nigeroside. The kinetics of the reaction were non-Michaelis-Menten, possibly because p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside has a dual role in the reaction as both a D-glucosyl donor and acceptor.
TI  - Disproportionation reactions catalyzed by Leuconostoc and Streptococcus glucansucrases.
AB  - Glucansucrases from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F and Streptococcus mutans 6715 were found to utilize a number of D-gluco-oligosaccharides as D-glucosyl donors and as acceptors. These donors included isomaltotriose and its homologs, panose, maltotriose, and dextran. In each case, D-glucosyl groups were transferred from the donor to an acceptor sugar. When the donor sugar also acted as an acceptor, disproportionation reactions occurred. Isomaltotriose, for example, gave rise to isomaltose and isomaltotetraose initially, and to a series of isomalto-oligosaccharides eventually. In addition to forming alpha-D-(1----6) linkages in the reactions, dextransucrase from S. mutans 6715 was capable of forming alpha-D-(1----3)-linked products.
TI  - Characterization of a mutant of serotype g Streptococcus mutans strain 6715 lacking dextran-induced agglutination.
AB  - A spontaneous mutant of Streptococcus mutans 6715 (serotype g) defective in dextran-induced agglutination ability was isolated. The wild type strain and its mutant were termed as 6715-DP and 6715-DN, respectively. Both strains possessed serotype g antigen, and exerted similar sugar fermentation patterns. Strain 6715-DP was rapidly and strongly agglutinated upon addition of high molecular weight dextran, whereas the mutant strain 6715-DN was not. [14C]Dextran prepared from Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase and [14C]sucrose bound to fresh or lyophilized 6715-DP cells, but not to the mutant 6715-DN cells. However, both strains adhered to a glass surface in the presence of sucrose. Furthermore, heat-treated (100 degrees C, 10 min) cells of both strains bound cell-free glucosyltransferase, although dextran agglutination ability of strain 6715-DP was destroyed by this treatment, indicating that receptors for dextran and glucosyltransferase were different entities. Furthermore, serotype c, e, and f strains S. mutans did not agglutinate upon addition of dextran, nor did they bind [14C]dextran. However, all these strains and both 6715-DP and 6715-DN strains induced marked dental caries in SPF rats. It is concluded that dextran-induced agglutination ability is not a necessary condition for S. mutans to induce dental caries.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Culture of five commonly used Acid-producing bacteria on banana pulp.
AB  - A significant fraction of the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. The use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. The abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing ripe or green bananas were examined. Three homofermentative bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the pH of a puree of ripe bananas from 4.8 to about 3.5 to 3.6 in 7 days at 37 degrees C. Action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in pH was less pronounced. Very little gas evolved. Lactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermenti) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in pH. About twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. The fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in a clear liquor. The color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. Fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance and aroma throughout a 1-month storage test.
TI  - [Lactic acid bacteria and streptococci of the human stomach normally and in pathological processes].
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were either absent or present in negligent quantities in the stomach of apparently healthy man. But in case of various pathological processes in the stomach and duodenum lactic acid bacteria accumulated (up to a million cells per 1 ml of gastric contents). Under these conditions coccal forms sharply prevailed over the bacillary ones. In patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer of the stomach the most frequent were Streptococcus faecalis and its variants; in oncological patients--Str. faecium, strains affiliated to Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and sometimes Str. durans.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans and Leuconostoc mesenteroides by sodium fluoride and ionic tin.
AB  - Sodium fluoride caused inhibition of growth rate and growth levels of Streptococcus mutans with glucose as the primary energy and carbon source. Stannous fluoride increased growth lag nad caused a much greater inhibition of growth rate than did sodium fluoride. Neither compound was found to be bactericidal when culture viability was measured after 6 days of incubation. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which lacks a phosphotransferase system for sugar transport, showed less inhibition of growth rate with both inhibitors than did S. mutans, which possesses a phosphotransferase system. Metabolism of glucose or lactose which requires enolase activity shoed sodium fluoride inhibition, whereas metabolism of arginine or pyruvate does not involve enolase activity and showed no inhibition of growth.
TI  - Induction of cytochrome formation and stimulation of oxidative dissimilation by hemin in Streptococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
TI  - Aerobic and facultative microflora of fresh and spoiled refrigerated dough products.
AB  - The microbial flora of fresh, unsterile, dough products held at refrigeration temperatures was compared with the microbial flora of the same products that had spoiled spontaneously. Various methods based on selective media were used to determine molds, yeasts, and bacteria present. Except for two special cases in which a yeast and Penicillium roqueforti induced spoilage, all of the samples deteriorated because of bacterial growth. A total of 1,132 bacterial isolates was subjected to further classification. In the spoiled products, 92% of the isolates belonged to the Lactobacillaceae. More than one-half of these (53%) belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, and an additional 36% were in the genus Leuconostoc. In the genus Leuconostoc almost all of the strains (94%) were L. mesenteroides. The third most common genus present was Streptococcus, represented by 3% of the total isolates. A preliminary taxonomic study of the microflora of refrigerated dough products revealed none of the isolates to be indicators of fecal contamination and none to be forms known to produce toxins. The highest counts encountered in the moist, fresh products were up to 200 million lactic acid bacteria per g in buttermilk biscuits, with a psychrophilic count as high as 4.8 million. In the spoiled samples, the highest total counts were 820 million in buttermilk biscuits. Mold counts were no higher than 1,800, except in the sample ruined by P. roqueforti where the count was 130,000 mold colonies.

TI  - Spherical Lactic Acid-producing Bacteria of Southern-grown Raw and Processed Vegetables.
AB  - The frequency and levels of population of the spherical lactic acid-producing bacteria were determined on raw and processed yellow summer and zucchini squash, a variety of greens, green beans, okra, southern peas, and butter and lima beans, and on fresh cucumbers and corn flowers. Six taxa occurred consistently: Leuconostoc mesenteroides, yellow-pigmented streptococci, Streptococcus faecium, Aerococcus viridans, and S. faecalis and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. The same taxa occurred with the same order of frequency on processed, frozen vegetables, but with a marked decrease in the occurrence of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. S. lactis, S. cremoris, S. equinus, S. bovis, and pediococci were isolated infrequently. No other member of the viridans group of the streptococci and no member of the pyogenic group was isolated. Approximately 88% of the cultures were identified. Total counts of the lactic-acid-producing bacteria rarely exceeded 10 per gram of sample, and there was a reduction by 90% during the second year of study, probably because of drought. Only one bacterial species was found on 40% of the raw and 34% of the processed vegetable samples. Two or more species or taxa were present on the remainder of 153 raw and 56 processed vegetable samples. A. viridans was present on squash, greens, okra, and southern peas, and its frequency of occurrence on vegetables suggests that plants are its natural habitat.
TI  - Acetaldehyde utilization by Leuconostoc species.
AB  - Single-strain cultures of Leuconostoc dextranicum and L. mesenteroides were found to be capable of utilizing acetaldehyde in both acidified and nonacidified milk cultures at 21 and 30 C. L. dextranicum utilized acetaldehyde more rapidly than L. mesenteroides when the pH of the medium was near that of normal ripened lactic dairy cultures. Acetaldehyde production and utilization varied widely among different two-strain cultures of lactic streptococci and leuconostocs. The concentration of acetaldehyde in ripened single-strain lactic streptococcal cultures was lowered by adding a large inoculum of ripened L. citrovorum culture and continuing incubation at 21 or 5 C.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL). Some of the effectors, e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, Lactobacillus lactis, L. brevis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of S. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most cultures were inhibitory, and some (S. faecium and L. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the Staphylococcus. Low-temperature meat lactobacilli and Leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited S. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 C throughout its growth. Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 C, as well. When the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat Lactobacillus, and L. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 C, and all but the meat Lactobacillus did so at 22 C. A ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 C, except that S. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by S. faecalis. A ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. In general, the more effector bacteria there were in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of S. aureus. Inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 C, less so at 20 or 25 C, and least at 30 or 37 C, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. Results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of S. aureus were similar, for the most part.
TI  - ROLE OF LEUCONOSTOC MESENTEROIDES IN LEAVENING THE BATTER OF IDLI, A FERMENTED FOOD OF INDIA.
AB  - The fermentation of the batter of idli, a fermented food of India, was studied. The microorganisms responsible for the characteristic changes in the batter were isolated and identified. Although there is a sequential change in the bacterial flora, the predominant microorganism responsible for souring, as well as for gas production, was found to be Leuconostoc mesenteroides. In the later stages of fermentation, growth of Streptococcus faecalis and, still later, of Pediococcus cerevisiae becomes significant. The fermentation of idli demonstrates a leavening action caused by the activity of the heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium, L. mesenteroides. As far as is known, this is the first record of a leavening action produced exclusively by the activity of a lactic acid bacterium.

TI  - TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE DEXTRANSUCRASE SYNTHESIS BY A LACTOBACILLUS.
AB  - Dunican, L. K. (Cornell University, Ithaca, New York), and H. W. Seeley, Jr. Temperature-sensitive dextransucrase synthesis by a lactobacillus. J. Bacteriol. 86:1079-1083. 1963.-Dextran synthesis was found to be temperature-dependent in Lactobacillus strain RWM-13. Dextran was not formed above 37 C, although growth of cells occurred up to 42 C. Logarithmically growing cells transferred from 30 C to 40 C ceased producing dextran while growth decreased nominally. An examination of the extracts of cells broken by sonic treatment showed that as the temperature of growth was increased above 37 C the production of dextransucrase decreased. By use of an inhibitor of invertase, 10(-4)m AgNO(3), it was shown that invertase replaced dextransucrase activity at temperatures above 37 C. In contrast to dextransucrase in Leuconostoc mesenteroides, the enzyme in Lactobacillus strain RWM-13 was constitutive and thus resembled that of Streptococcus bovis. Thermosensitivity of dextransucrase synthesis has not been observed in Leuconostoc or Streptococcus.
TI  - NATURE OF THE LIPIDS OF SOME LACTIC ACID BACTERIA.
AB  - Ikawa, Miyoshi (University of California, Berkeley). Nature of the lipids of some lactic acid bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 85:772-781. 1963.-Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus cerevisiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were grown on a lipid-free medium, and the amounts of acetone-soluble lipids, acetone-insoluble phospholipids, and unextracted or bound lipid in the cells were estimated. Neutral glycerides appeared to be absent, or present only in traces, in L. casei and S. faecalis. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides, and P. cerevisiae, in addition to containing glycerides, appeared to contain glycolipids of glucose and galactose. Glycerol was present in the phospholipid fraction of all the organisms, and, in addition, galactose was present in L. mesenteroides. Paper chromatography of hydrolysates of the phospholipid fractions showed the absence of the usual phospholipid nitrogen bases, serine, ethanolamine, and choline, in these organisms. Microbiological assays of lyophilized unextracted cells for myo-inositol and choline also showed that lipids containing these components occurred in very small amounts at most. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the phospholipid fraction of L. casei, L. plantarum, P. cerevisiae, and S. faecalis was lysine, which seemed to be exclusively of the l configuration. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the L. mesenteroides phospholipid fraction was d-alanine. These amino acids appeared to be bound in components of the phospholipid fraction and not free.
