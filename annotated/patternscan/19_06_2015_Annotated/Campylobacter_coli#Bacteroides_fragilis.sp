TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == [traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment].
AB  == bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (etec) ou enteroadherent escherichia coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp., campylobacter jejuni, acrobacter  sp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis. prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis)  is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ors) consisting of salt, sugar and water. antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea.
AB  == purpose of review: travelers' diarrhea affects 20-60% of travelers to low-income  regions of the world. much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new  information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies. recent findings: travel to south asia, followed by sub-saharan africa and south america, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers.  women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and il-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin e. coli. overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. a new transdermal lt vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. it remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent  late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. for self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter spp., such as south and southeast asia and possibly north africa, central and south america. summary: there is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == aetiology of diarrhoea in a birth cohort of children aged 0-2 year(s) in rural mirzapur, bangladesh.
AB  == the incidence of aetiology-specific diarrhoea and the pathogenicity of infectious agents in a birth cohort (n=252) in rural bangladesh were determined. stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected from diarrhoeal cases over two years and routinely on a monthly basis. stool samples from children with diarrhoea were compared with stool samples from children without diarrhoea to calculate rates of isolation and pathogenicity of agents. in total, 1750 stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 5679 stool specimens from children without diarrhoea were  tested. an infectious agent was identified in 58% of the stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 21.6% of the stool specimens from children without diarrhoea. the most commonly-isolated pathogens from all specimens were enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteroadherent e. coli, shigella, campylobacter jejuni, giardia, and rotavirus. etec (st and lt-st toxin), enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, shigella, and rotavirus were associated more with disease than with asymptomatic infections. aetiology-specific infections were associated with acute episodes. the isolated enteropathogens were essentially the same as those found in other tropical rural settings. enterotoxigenic b. fragilis was also identified as a pathogen. ongoing vaccine efforts focusing on shigella, rotavirus, and etec would be useful.

TI  == microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  == drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. poor water  quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and vibrio cholerae o1, and possibly enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp. v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum. all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is  a huge problem. emerging environmental pathogens, such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. in adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. so in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e) various enteroviruses, c. jejuni  and h. pylori are emerging issues in adults.

TI  == case-control study of enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. the center treats more than 100,000  patients a year. to obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in october 1979.  the first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982,  which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. in subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. to assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. the children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. they were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. the study was conducted from february 1993 to june 1994. a potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (p =  0.0001). even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified  rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp.  , and vibrio cholerae o1 as major pathogens. the present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. in addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp., v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., diffusely adherent e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. enteroinvasive e. coli,  enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. the major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. as in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, v. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic e. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. with a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. this knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.

TI  == comparison of lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides, porphyromonas, prevotella, campylobacter and wolinella spp. by tricine-sds-page.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera bacteroides (b. fragilis), prevotella (pr. melaninogenica), porphyromonas  (po. gingivalis), campylobacter (c. fetus subsp. fetus), and wolinella (w. succinogenes), and from the type strains of b. distasonis, b. forsythus, b. ureolyticus, po. levii, po. macacae, and c. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (westphal method). s-form lpss, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. lipid a was not stained. also  profiles from lps of escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:b4 and 055:b5, could be distinguished. while w. succinogenes showed a relatively short s-form lps on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including b. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder lpss. po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest o-chain. the long o-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.

TI  == purification and characterization of ferritin from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we purified an iron-containing protein from campylobacter jejuni using ultracentrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. electron microscopy of this  protein revealed circular particles with a diameter of 11.5 nm and a central core with a diameter of 5.5 nm. the protein was composed of a single peptide of 21 kda and did not serologically cross-react with horse spleen ferritin. the uv-visible  spectrum of the protein showed no absorption peaks in the visible region, indicating that little or no heme is bound. the ratio of fe:phosphate of c. jejuni ferritin was 1.5:1. from these morphological and chemical examinations, we concluded that the c. jejuni purified protein is a ferritin of the same class as  that of helicobacter pylori and bacteroides fragilis and differs from the heme-containing bacterioferritin of escherichia coli. the 30 n-terminal amino acids were sequenced and were found to resemble the sequences of other ferritins  strongly (h. pylori ferritin, 73% identity; b. fragilis ferritin, 50% identity; e. coli gene-165 product, 50% identity), and to a lesser degree, bacterioferritins (e. coli bacterioferritin, 26% identity; azotobacter vinelandii, 26% identity; horse spleen ferritin 30% identity). proteins that cross-reacted with antiserum against the ferritin of c. jejuni were found in other campylobacter species and in h. pylori, but not in vibrio, e. coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == a comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci  were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold  dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin  against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.

TI  == spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (cp-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a; also designated xz-450 [pliva pharmaceuticals, zagreb, yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. it was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against branhamella catarrhalis, campylobacter species, and legionella species. it had activity similar to that of erythromycin against chlamydia spp. azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family enterobacteriaceae; its mic for 90% of strains of escherichia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates. it had moderate activity against bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. the  mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14c]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates.  an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and  10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at  4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == erythromycin. new indications and toxicities.
AB  == although erythromycin was introduced into clinical medicine more than 28 years ago, the indications for its use continue to expand. this antibiotic has emerged  as appropriate therapy for legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus species, enteritis and colitis produced by campylobacter fetus, and soft tissue and pleuropulmonary  anaerobic infections in which bacteroides fragilis plays no role. in combination  with an aminoglycoside, erythromycin has proven to be effective for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colon surgery. additional  therapeutic indications continue to be explored. the renewed interest in erythromycin has resulted in a closer examination of its potential for toxicity.  new untoward events attributed to erythromycin administration have been described. this antibiotic has produced both reversible hearing loss and pseudomembranous colitis. erythromycin also possesses the ability to inhibit the  degradation of theophylline.
