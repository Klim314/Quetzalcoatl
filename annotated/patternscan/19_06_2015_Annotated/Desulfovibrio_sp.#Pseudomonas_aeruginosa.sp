TI  == tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (cahs), perchloroethene (pce), carbon tetrachloride (ct),  chloroform (cf) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-dca), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  clostridium sp. and paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens, shewanella oneidensis and desulfovibrio vulgaris). effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (ec50) were determined. the octanol-water partition coefficient or log po/w of a cah proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar cahs cf and 1,2-dca, respectively, than the two relatively  less polar compounds pce and ct. ec50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher  tolerance levels. overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to cahs than  respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to cahs. these data extend the current understanding of the impact of cahs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.

TI  == [lectin-binding analysis of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix carbohydrate composition of corrosion-aggressive bacteria].
AB  == the carbohydrate components of biofilms of corrosion-aggressive bacteria were studied by transmisstion electron microscopy using lectins labeled with colloidal gold. n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and neutral carbohydrates d-glucose and d-mannose were found within the exopolymeric matrix. lectins with equal carbohydrate specificity demonstrated different degrees of interaction with the carbohydrate components of bacterial biofilms. to identify n-acetyl-d-galactosamine in biofilms of desulfovibrio sp. 10 and bacillus subtilis 36, the lba lectin appeared to be most specific; in the case of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine in biofilms of b. subtilis 36 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27, the wga lectin. during visualization of neutral carbohydrates in the studied  cultures, the psa lectin was most specific. we have shown that lectins labeled with colloidal gold could be used as an express method for the identification and localization of carbohydrates in glycopolymers of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix.

TI  == [role of polymer complexes in the formation of biofilms by corrosive bacteria on  steel surfaces].
AB  == the composition of exopolymer complexes (epcs), synthesized by the monocultures desulfovibrio sp. 10, bacillus subtilis 36, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 and by  microbial associations involved in the corrosion of metal surfaces has been studied. an analysis of the monosaccharide composition of carbohydrate components, as well as the fatty acid composition of the lipid part of epcs, was  carried out by gas-liquid chromatography (glc). it was found that bacteria in biofilms synthesized polymers; this process was dominated by glucose, while the growth of bacteria in a suspension was marked by a high rhamnose content. hexouronic acids and hexosamine have been revealed as a part of b. subtilis 36 and p. aeruginosa 27 epcs. qualitative differences were revealed in the fatty acid composition ofexopolymers in biofilms and in a bacterial suspension. it was  shown that the transition to a biofilm form of growth led to an increase in the unsaturation degree of fatty acids in the exopolymers of associative cultures. the results can be used to develop methods to control microbial corrosion of metal surfaces.

TI  == [role of exopolymeric substances of corrosion-aggressive bacteria in the biofilm  formation on the steel surface].
AB  == it had been done the comparative study of the exopolymeric substances (eps) synthesized by the sulfidogenic microbial community and monocultures of desulfovibrio sp. 10, bacillus subtilis 36 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 under various growth models as biofilm and plankton was performed. it was established that biofilm-produced exopolymers contained increased amount of glucose and fucose, while planktonic ones had more amount of mannose and rhamnose. the amount of rhamnose was 24% of the total amount of carbohydrates in the planktonic-produced exopolymers synthesized by pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 and bacillus subtilis 36. glucuronic acid, galactosamine and glucosamine along with neutral carbohydrates were found in the composition of eps synthesized by associative cultures, while only galactosamine was found in eps synthesized by desulfovibrio sp. 10. the amount of hexuronic acids and hexozamines was, respectively, 4.6 and 1.6 times higher in the biofilm formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 on the steel surface, than in the planktonic exopolymers. it is discussed the role in the biofilm formation of dominative members of the corrosion-aggressive microbial community.

TI  == combined strategy for the precipitation of heavy metals and biodegradation of petroleum in industrial wastewaters.
AB  == the precipitation of chromium(iii), copper(ii), manganese(ii) and zinc(ii) by biogenic hydrogen sulfide generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria, desulfovibrio sp., and the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (tph) in the presence of heavy metal by pseudomonas aeruginosa at18 have been carried out. an anaerobic stirred tank reactor was used to generate hydrogen sulfide with desulfovibrio sp. culture and the precipitation of more than 95% of each metal was achieved in 24 h (metal solutions contained: 60, 49, 50 and 80 mg l(-1) of chromium, copper, manganese and zinc sulfates). a stirred tank reactor with p. aeruginosa at18, in  the presence of the heavy metal solution and 2% (v/v) of petroleum, led to the degradation of 60% of the total petroleum hydrocarbons and the removal of cr(iii) 99%, cu(ii) 93%, zn(ii) 46% and mn(ii) 88% in the medium through biosorption phenomena. these results enabled the development of an integrated system in which the two processes were combined. the overall aim of the study was achieved, with  84% of tph degraded and all of the metals completely removed. work is currently underway aimed at improving this system (decrease in operation time, culture of p. aeruginosa in anaerobic conditions) in an effort to apply this process in the  bioremediation of natural media contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum.

TI  == the influence of fluid shear and aici3 on the material properties of pseudomonas  aeruginosa pao1 and desulfovibrio sp. ex265 biofilms.
AB  == an understanding of the material properties of biofilms is important when describing how biofilms physically interact with their environment. in this study, aerobic biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) biofilms of desulfovibrio sp. ex265 were grown under different fluid shear stresses (tau g) in a chemostat recycle loop. individual biofilm microcolonies were deformed by varying the fluid wall shear stress (tau w). the deformation was quantified in terms of strain (epsilon), and  the relative strength of the biofilms was assessed using an apparent elastic coefficient (eapp) and residual strain (epsilon r) after three cycles of deformation. aluminium chloride (alcl3) was then added to both sets of biofilm and the tests repeated. biofilms grown under higher shear were more rigid and had a greater yield shear stress than those grown under lower shear. the addition of  alcl3 resulted in a significant increase in eapp and also increased the yield point. we conclude that the strength of the biofilm is in part dependent on the shear under which the biofilm was grown and that the material properties of the biofilm may be manipulated through cation cross-linking of the extracellular polysaccharide (eps) slime matrix.

TI  == dimethyl sulfoxide as an electron acceptor for anaerobic growth.
AB  == the isolation from lake mud of a bacterium which can use dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as an electron acceptor for growth is described. the isolate, called strain dl-1, was a small, gram negative, non-motile spiral. the sole product of dmso reduction was dimethyl sulfide (dms). other electron acceptors used by the isolate included sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, methionine sulfoxide, tetramethylene sulfoxide, nitrate, and oxygen (microaerophilically). sulfate was  not reduced and could not even be assimilated. lactate or succinate could serve as electron donors, with acetate as the main product. hydrogen could be used as an electron donor if acetate was present in the medium as a carbon source. the organism has a c-type cytochrome, and most likely uses electron transport phosphorylation during dmso reduction. cultures of desulfovibrio sp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris were tested for growth using dmso as an electron acceptor, and only the proteus strain grew. both proteus and  strain dl-1 are versatile at coupling reductions with energy generation. there is a marked resemblance between strain dl-1 and the recently described sulfur-reducing spirillum of wolfe and pfennig.
