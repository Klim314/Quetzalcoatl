TI  - Lactococcus garvieae carries a chromosomally encoded pentapeptide repeat protein  that confers reduced susceptibility to quinolones in Escherichia coli producing a cytotoxic effect.
AB  - This study characterises a chromosomal gene of Lactococcus garvieae encoding a pentapeptide repeat protein designated as LgaQnr. This gene has been implicated in reduced susceptibility to quinolones in this bacterium, which is of relevance to both veterinary and human medicine. All of the L. garvieae isolates analysed were positive for the lgaqnr gene. The expression of lgaqnr in Escherichia coli reduced the susceptibility to quinolones, producing an adverse effect. The reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was 16-fold in E. coli ATCC 25922 and 32-fold in E. coli DH10B, compared to the control strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration of nalidixic acid was also increased 4 or 5-fold. The effect of the expression of lgaqnr in E. coli was investigated by electron microscopy and was observed to affect the structure of the cell and the inner membrane of the recombinant cells.
TI  - Immunoprotection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Lactococcus garvieae against Lactococcosis in tilapia.
AB  - In this study, the gene encoding 40 kDa GAPDH of L. garvieae was determined and overexpressed by using the Escherichia coli expression system. Analysis results indicated that the sequences of GAPDH of L. garvieae nucleotide and its amino acid are highly homologous (80.4-100%) to several products of GAPDH from L. garvieae and other Streptococcus-related bacteria. According to Western blotting results, rabbit antiserum and tilapia infection serum reacted strongly to the recombinant GAPDH protein. In another experiment, tilapia were immunized intraperitoneally with formalin-killed L. garvieae whole cells, recombinant GAPDH (50 mug fish(-1)) from L. garvieae or both. ISA 763A was used as an adjuvant for vaccine and saline was used as a negative control. The fish challenged at 4 weeks after immunization with GAPDH+WC+ISA had the highest survival rate at 100%, followed by fish immunized with WC+ISA or GAPDH+ISA, which had RPS values of 87.5% and 50%, respectively. Additionally, specific antibody responses against L. garvieae whole cells and GAPDH were based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Following 4 weeks of immunization, the specific antibody level of all vaccine groups significantly increased, except for antibody responses against L. garvieae GAPDH of those immunized with formalin-killed L. garvieae whole cells. Our results further demonstrated that GAPDH from L. garvieae protected tilapia from experimental L. garvieae infection, implying the potential use of L. garvieae GAPDH as a vaccine against L. garvieae.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Acute and subchronic toxicity and genotoxicity of SE5-OH, an equol-rich product produced by Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - The consumption of soy-based products is associated with a number of health benefits and much of these benefits are proposed to be due to the soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein, glycitein, their glycosides, and equol, an isoflavone naturally produced from daidzein. Equol is a naturally bacterially-derived metabolite of daidzein and is produced by bacteria in the gut of those humans capable of hosting the particular organism. To allow all humans to enjoy the health benefits of equol, a new functional food ingredient has been developed that relies on bacterial conversion of daidzein to equol under strictly controlled conditions. This new food substance, termed SE5-OH, has been studied extensively for its acute and subchronic toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats, as well as for its potential genotoxicity. The oral LD(50) is >4,000 mg/kg. In a 91-day, subchronic study, the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 2,000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. SE5-OH was negative in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 and in Escherichia coli tester strain WP2uvrA with and without metabolic activation. SE5-OH was negative for chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster lung cells up to 3,000 microg/ml with and without metabolic activation and did not induce increases in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes taken from Sprague-Dawley rats administered (via gavage) up to 4,000 mg/kg SE5-OH twice daily for two consecutive days.
TI  - Construction of transposition insertion libraries and specific gene inactivation  in the pathogen Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - This paper reports the development of genetic tools in Lactococcus garvieae, an important Gram-positive bacterial pathogen affecting both fish and mammals. The vector pGKV210, a broad host range vector, was introduced by electroporation into L. garvieae UNIUD074. The maximal frequency obtained was 3.2 x 10(5) transformants/mug of DNA. Moreover, this effect is highly reproducible and appears to be constant, since all L. garvieae strains tested were transformed. Once the optimal transformation procedure was established, it was used to generate isogenic and transposition mutants. Insertional mutagenesis of the L. garvieae SA9H10L gene, similar to a Streptococcus pyogenes gene encoding the M protein (emm64), was carried out using the conditional replication plasmid pORI19. Transposition mutagenesis using the streptococcal temperature-sensitive suicide vector pTV408 to deliver Tn917 into the chromosome of L. garvieae was also achieved at a frequency of ca. 10(-4). Transposon flanking DNA sequences were obtained by plasmid rescue in Escherichia coli and their sequencing analysis demonstrated that the transposon was inserted at different chromosomal loci. Tn917 also made it possible to select a mutant in the operon involved in mannitol fermentation in this microorganism. The results obtained in the present study lay the foundation for future research on the virulence mechanisms of L. garvieae.
TI  - Identification and antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in porcine blood from industrial slaughterhouses--a preliminary study.
AB  - Ninety-seven lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from slaughterhouse porcine blood in order to select autochthonous LAB strains for use as biopreservatives of this by-product. They were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing; and their inhibition capacity was determined against four bacterial species frequently found in contaminated blood, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus spp. The taxonomic study showed an unexpected low diversity of LAB in blood, i.e. only 8 different species were found, from which just 4, i.e. Enterococcus raffinosus, Lactobacillus murinus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus garvieae, amounted to more than 90% of all isolates. Inhibition tests in solid culture media proved that S. aureus and Bacillus spp. were inhibited by most LAB strains obtained from porcine blood. E. coli was the indicator less affected by the isolated LAB species. Several isolates efficiently inhibited the growth of all tested indicators.
TI  - Purification and characterization of lysozyme from plasma of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica).
AB  - Lysozyme was purified from the plasma of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica)  using a combination of ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies. The molecular mass of purified lysozyme was estimated at 18.4 kDa by SDS-PAGE, and its isoelectric point was greater than 10. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified enzyme revealed a high-sequence homology with i-type lysozymes. No similarity was found however between the N-terminal sequence of oyster plasma lysozyme and N-terminal sequences of other i-type lysozymes, suggesting that the N-terminal sequences of the i-type lysozymes may vary to a greater extent between species than reported in earlier studies. The optimal ionic strength, pH, cation concentrations, sea salt concentrations, and temperature for activity of the purified lysozyme were determined, as well as its temperature and pH stability. Purified oyster plasma lysozyme inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus sp.) and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Vibrio vulnificus). This is a first report of a lysozyme purified from an oyster species and from the plasma of a bivalve mollusc.
TI  - Identification of genes in a KG- phenotype of Lactococcus garvieae, a fish pathogenic bacterium, whose proteins react with antiKG- rabbit serum.
AB  - Five different clones (SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10) were isolated from the gene library of the Lactococcus garvieae SA8201 (KG-) strain by immunological screening using rabbit serum against L. garvieae (KG-) phenotype cells. A Western blot analysis indicated that the molecular sizes of immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10, which were fused with LacZ protein, were 25, 30, 28, 26 and 13 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01 and SA8A11 were homologous to a processing protease of Bacillus subtilis (36.6%), dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli (34.6%), trigger factor of B. subtilis (45.8%) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase of Vibrio furnissii (37.1%), respectively. There was no significant homologous sequence of SA9H10 in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and SwissProt. We cloned and sequenced a longer DNA fragment (SA9H10L) of SA9H10 from the gene library. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone was weak homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (22.7%). Five genes were specifically expressed in the KG- phenotype strains. However, SA8A11 and SA9H10 was expressed in the mutated strain SA8201-TTC, whose serological phenotype was changed from KG- to KG+ by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
TI  - Application of flow cytometry for rapid detection of Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - Flow cytometry (FCM) technique was applied to rapid determination of cell number  of Lactococcus garvieae. An antiserum against L. garvieae was prepared and its immunological property was examined. The present antibody would recognize some epitopes of L. garvieae with a high specificity. The optimum conditions for the FCM assay were as follows: discriminate value, 60; dilution ratio of the antiserum, 1.0 x 10(4). Calibration curve for L. garvieae cells was linear, in the range of 2.4 x 10(4)-1.5 x 10(7) cells/mL. The detection of L. garvieae in cell suspensions contaminated with Escherichia coli was carried out. A good correlation was observed in the range of 20-90% for the mixing ratio of L. garvieae. One FCM assay could be completed within 2 min, and the total assay time, including the preparation of bacterial sample, was within 3 h.
