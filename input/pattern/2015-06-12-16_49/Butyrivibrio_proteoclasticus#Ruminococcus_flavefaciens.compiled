TI  - Diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the diversity of the Butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (GO) supplementation as revealed by molecular analysis of cloned 16S rRNA genes. Six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. Goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with GO ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). Ruminal contents were used for DNA extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. A total bacterial clone library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene cloned sequences using universal primers. The resulting plasmids selected by Butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a Butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. Butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and GO group, respectively. In libraries, clones were classified to the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio, Butyrivibrio and others within the family Lachnospiraceae. Additionally, some specific clones were observed in GO group, being classified to the genus Ruminococcus and others within the family Ruminococcaceae. Based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. B. proteoclasticus and Ps. ruminis) in control and GO groups, respectively. Further clones identified as B. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and R. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and GO groups, respectively. The majority of clones resembled Ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for Lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. The two clone libraries also appeared different in Shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and GO group 2.91). Our results indicated that the Butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.
TI  - Forage type and fish oil cause shifts in rumen bacterial diversity.
AB  - Despite evidence supporting improved incorporation of beneficial polyunsaturated  fatty acids (PUFA) into ruminant products, such as meat and milk, following red clover and fish oil (FO) inclusion in the ruminant diet, little is known regarding the concomitant bacterial diversity. We evaluated the effects of feeding grass vs. red clover silage with incremental FO inclusion on known lipolytic, biohydrogenating, cellulolytic and proteolytic rumen bacterial communities of steers. Following 14 days of dietary adaptation, liquid-associated (LAB) and solid-associated (SAB) bacterial communities were harvested, DNA extracted and bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and specific-bacterial quantitative PCR (QPCR) were undertaken. DGGE-derived dendrograms showed that diet caused the greatest change in LAB and SAB bacterial diversity, with FO inclusion at the 2% and 3% dry matter intake also causing some changes. QPCR revealed that diet resulted in changes in the DNA concentration of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, the Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. FO inclusion caused changes in A. lipolytica, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens DNA concentration only. In the B. proteoclasticus group, which are the only known bacteria with the capacity to biohydrogenate PUFA to 18:0, DNA concentration did not correlate to 18:0 flow to the duodenum, however, suggesting that other bacteria may play a role in biohydrogenation. A greater understanding of microbial changes that accompany beneficial dietary changes will lead to novel strategies to improve ruminant product quality.
