TI  - Calcium carbonate precipitation by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from biofilms  formed on deteriorated ignimbrite stones: influence of calcium on EPS production and biofilm formation by these isolates.
AB  - Heterotrophic CaCO3-precipitating bacteria were isolated from biofilms on deteriorated ignimbrites, siliceous acidic rocks, from Morelia Cathedral (Mexico) and identified as Enterobacter cancerogenus (22e), Bacillus sp. (32a) and Bacillus subtilis (52g). In solid medium, 22e and 32a precipitated calcite and vaterite while 52g produced calcite. Urease activity was detected in these isolates and CaCO3 precipitation increased in the presence of urea in the liquid medium. In the presence of calcium, EPS production decreased in 22e and 32a and increased in 52g. Under laboratory conditions, ignimbrite colonization by these isolates only occurred in the presence of calcium and no CaCO3 was precipitated. Calcium may therefore be important for biofilm formation on stones. The importance of the type of stone, here a siliceous stone, on biological colonization is emphasized. This calcium effect has not been reported on calcareous materials. The importance of the effect of calcium on EPS production and biofilm formation is discussed in relation to other applications of CaCO3 precipitation by bacteria.
TI  - Decolorisation and detoxification of Direct Blue-15 by a bacterial consortium.
AB  - Studies were carried out on decolorisation and biotransformation of the dye Direct Blue-15 into 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (O'-dianisidine) and a sulphonated derivative by a five-member bacterial consortium. Chromatographic studies revealed further complete biodegradation of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine coupled with release of ammonia, but the recalcitrant sulphonated derivative persisted. The microorganisms identified in the mixed consortium by 16S rDNA sequence analysis were Alcaligenes faecalis, Sphingomonas sp. EBD, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Enterobacter cancerogenus. The cytotoxicity data showed a significant reduction in the toxicity (P<0.001) of the degraded dye as evidenced from the number of viable human polymorphonuclear leukocyte cells present.
