TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.
