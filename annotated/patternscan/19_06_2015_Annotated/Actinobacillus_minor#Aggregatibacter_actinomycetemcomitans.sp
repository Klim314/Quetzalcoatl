TI  == the highly leukotoxic jp2 clone of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: evolutionary aspects, epidemiology and etiological role in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == for many years, attention has been given to the oral bacterium aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, as a species possibly implicated in the etiology of aggressive periodontitis in adolescents. one of the major virulence factors of a. actinomycetemcomitans is the leukotoxin which is able to kill important cells of  the immune system. as demonstrated in population genetic analyses, the population structure of a. actinomycetemcomitans is mainly clonal with evolutionary lineages corresponding to the serotypes. a particular highly leukotoxic clone (jp2) of serotype b has been discovered. the jp2 clone, with an estimated origin some 2400 years ago, is found to be highly conserved, based on analyses of a collection of  jp2 clone strains collected through more than 20 years from individuals of diverse origin and living geographically widespread. despite demonstration of minor evolutionary changes within the genome of jp2 clone strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, the jp2 clone strains constitute a unique clonal type, the characteristics of which include a 530 basepair deletion in the leukotoxin operon implicated in the enhanced leukotoxic activity of the clone. mapping of the geographic occurrence of the jp2 clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans has revealed that its colonization is largely restricted to individuals of african descent. characteristic mutations, which allow jp2 clone isolates from the mediterranean region to be distinguished from isolates from west africa, including the cape verde islands, suggest that the jp2 clone initially emerged as a distinct genotype in the mediterranean region of africa and subsequently spread to west africa, from where it might have been transferred to the american continent during the transatlantic slave trade. the finding of a sustained selective colonization of individuals of african descent, despite geographical separation from the african continent for centuries, suggests that the jp2 clone might have  a distinct host tropism. further studies are needed to elucidate the reasons for  the apparent selective colonization of the mediterranean and western african populations. the jp2 clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans appears to play a prominent role in the etiology of aggressive periodontitis compared to other clonal types of the species. while a. actinomycetemcomitans, in general, is considered an opportunistic pathogen of the resident oral microbiota, the jp2 clone has features similar to those of an exogenous pathogen. clonal types other  than jp2 can be isolated from healthy as well as periodontally diseased individuals, whereas the jp2 clone has been isolated primarily from periodontally diseased individuals. as demonstrated in a prospective cohort study in morocco, where the jp2 clone is endemically present, the presence of this clone in dental  plaque confers a remarkably increased risk for development of aggressive periodontitis, suggesting that the jp2 clone is an important etiological agent of aggressive periodontitis in adolescents. support for association of clonal types  other than jp2 of a. actinomycetemcomitans with aggressive periodontitis has also been provided, but the association is much weaker. nearly half of the jp2 clone carriers were found to be persistently infected during a two-year follow-up period, which indicates a level of stability of colonization with the jp2 clone similar to that previously reported for non-jp2 clonal types of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the relative risk of aggressive periodontitis is highest for individuals with stable jp2 clone colonization. although the method used is not quantitative, this finding adds to the evidence for a causal role of the jp2  clone in aggressive periodontitis. longitudinal data shows that few individuals are colonized with the jp2 clone de novo after puberty. patterns of parent-child  carriage and shared colonization of jp2 clone strains among siblings have been demonstrated in other studies, altogether indicating that transmission of the jp2 clone, like other clonal types of a. actinomycetemcomitans, occurs vertically, and through close person to person contacts. in conclusion, a conserved and highly leukotoxic clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans with unique characteristics and with an apparent linkage to individuals of african descent has been identified. being aware that the genetic constitution of the hosts has not been considered and that focus in our studies has been on a. actinomycetemcomitans only, and not on other members of the oral microbiota, we conclude that the jp2 clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans is a likely etiological agent of aggressive periodontitis in adolescents.

TI  == microbiological and immunological characteristics of young moroccan patients with aggressive periodontitis with and without detectable aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans jp2 infection.
AB  == cross-sectional and longitudinal studies identify the jp2 clone of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as an aetiological agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp) in adolescents of northwest african descent. to gain information on why a significant part of moroccan adolescents show clinical signs of periodontal disease in the absence of this pathogen we performed comprehensive mapping of the subgingival microbiota of eight young moroccans, four of whom were diagnosed with clinical signs of agp. the analysis was carried out by sequencing  and phylogenetic analysis of a total of 2717 cloned polymerase chain reaction amplicons of the phylogenetically informative 16s ribosomal rna gene. the analyses revealed a total of 173 bacterial taxa of which 39% were previously undetected. the jp2 clone constituted a minor proportion of the complex subgingival microbiota in patients with active disease. rather than identifying alternative aetiologies to agp, the recorded infection history of the subjects combined with remarkably high concentrations of antibodies against the a. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin suggest that disease activity was terminated in  some patients with agp as a result of elimination of the jp2 clone. this study provides information on the microbial context of the jp2 clone activity in a jp2-susceptible population and suggests that such individuals may develop immunity to agp.

TI  == a clinical study: melaleuca, manuka, calendula and green tea mouth rinse.
AB  == a novel mouthrinse (ind 61,164) containing essential oils and extracts from four  plant species (melaleuca alternifolia, leptospermum scoparium, calendula officinalis and camellia sinensis) were tested. this study aimed to evaluate the  safety, palatability and preliminary efficacy of the rinse. fifteen subjects completed the phase i safety study. seventeen subjects completed the phase ii randomized placebo-controlled study. plaque was collected, gingival and plaque indices were recorded (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). the relative abundance of two periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tanerella forsythensis) was determined utilizing digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. ancova was used at the p = 0.05 level of significance. two subjects reported a minor adverse event. one subject withdrew from the study. several subjects objected to the taste of the test rinse but continued treatment. differences between gingival index, plaque index or relative abundance of either bacterial species did not reach statistical significance when comparing nine placebo subjects with eight test rinse subjects. subjects exposed to the test rinse experienced no abnormal oral lesions, altered vital signs, changes in liver, kidney, or bone marrow function. larger scale studies would be necessary to determine the efficacy and oral health benefits of the test rinse.

TI  == endpoint quantitative pcr assays for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for periodontal pathogens are so sensitive that they detect infections of no clinical significance. quantitative pcr (qpcr) may provide a solution to this problem. however, most qpcr systems require expensive real-time thermal cyclers. objective: our goal was to develop qpcr assays which would allow endpoint quantification. materials and methods: 16s rrna primers for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were adapted to the amplifluor qpcr system, which incorporates fluorescein into the pcr product so that endpoint fluorescence is proportional to the original amount of template. dna dilutions representing known numbers of cells were used as standard curves. pooled subgingival plaques from the four deepest pockets of 21 severe adult periodontitis patients were assayed. buccal molar supragingival plaque from 35 dental students provided healthy controls. endpoint fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader. results: optimized standard curves were linear in log-log or semilog fits over a range of 100-10(6) cells. countable b. forsythus was present in all patients, with counts (as logs) from 2.4 to 7.3 (mean = 5.0), and 11 controls with counts from 2.1 to 4.5 (mean = 3.0). p. gingivalis was present in 11 patients and no controls, with counts from 2.2 to 4.7 (mean = 3.2). a. actinomycetemcomitans was present in two patients, with counts of 1.5 and 3.5. conclusions: amplifluor qpcr assays discriminated between  plaque samples differing by one log or more, allowing major infections to be distinguished from minor ones. this approach allows high-throughput qpcr of plaque samples, using equipment available to many laboratories.

TI  == serum-mediated release of leukotoxin from the cell surface of the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the leukotoxin of the periodontopathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is  an important virulence factor that lyses human neutrophils and monocytes and thus, it may enable the bacterium to evade the local host defense. the toxin also induces degranulation of neutrophils and cytokine release in monocytes. to trigger these biological activities, leukotoxin has to be released from the bacterium and diffuse into the periodontal tissues. to date, the conditions found to cause toxin release have been artificial and have included high ion concentration and alkaline conditions. to study the release of the toxin under conditions mimicking the natural environment of the periodontium the ability of human serum to enable leukotoxin release from the bacterial surface was examined. suspensions of leukotoxic a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were incubated with various concentrations of human serum or serum albumin. the suspensions were centrifuged and the leukotoxin in the supernatants or the cell pellets was detected by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. serum was found to cause the  rapid release of leukotoxin from the bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. pure albumin exhibited a similar effect. the leukotoxin released was active against human neutrophils. only a minor proportion of it was associated with membranous vesicles produced by the bacteria. the results indicate that serum, a fluid closely related to the exudate in inflamed periodontal pockets, releases leukotoxin from the cell surface of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the process may enable the diffusion of the toxin from the bacterial biofilm into the surrounding tissues, where it can exert its biological effect.

TI  == salivary iga subclasses and bacteria-reactive iga in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the local salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) response in patients with aggressive periodontitis to oral microorganisms and its role for the pathogenesis has not been determined. this study investigated the hypothesis that aggressive periodontitis patients have impaired oral secretory immunity. our test group was  made-up of 19 aggressive periodontitis patients and 19 age- and gender-matched periodontally healthy controls. total iga, iga subclass 1, iga subclass 2 and iga reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, treponema denticola atcc 35404 and candida albicans dsm 3454 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in whole unstimulated and stimulated saliva. a statistically  significantly lower concentration and secretion rate of total salivary iga (p < 0.01) and iga1 (p < 0.001) was found in the aggressive periodontitis group in resting and stimulated saliva. a decrease of iga2 (p < 0.05) was seen in resting  saliva. although only minor differences were detected in the concentration and secretion of bacteria-reactive iga in both groups, the proportion of bacteria-reactive iga from the total iga was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the aggressive periodontitis group in all three microorganisms tested. our results indicate an inhibition of total secretory iga. in particular an iga subclass 1-specific decrease in aggressive periodontitis was noted, while the bacteria-reactive humoral immune system in saliva was activated. the role of the  decrease of iga1 immunoglobulins in aggressive periodontitis with respect to susceptibility for periodontal diseases has to be elucidated.

TI  == regulation of matrix metalloproteinase production by cytokines, pharmacological agents and periodontal pathogens in human periodontal ligament fibroblast cultures.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). produced by both infiltrating and resident cells of the periodontium, play a role in physiologic and pathologic events. it is recognized that an imbalance between activated mmps and their endogenous inhibitors leads to pathologic breakdown of the extracellular matrix during periodontitis. to date, little is known about the regulation of mmp synthesis and secretion in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlfs). the purpose of this  study was to examine the effects of cytokines, pharmacological agents (protein synthesis inhibitor and protein kinase c inhibitors) and predominant periodontal  pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) on  mmp production in human pdlfs using gelatin zymography. the gelatin zymograms revealed that the main gelatinase secreted by human pdlfs migrated at 72 kda and  represents mmp-2. minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kda regions  that correspond to mmp-9. we found that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and il-1alpha can elevate mmp-2 secretion in human pdlfs. these results indicate  that periodontal pathogens and inflammatory cytokines play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix in periodontal diseases. thus, activation of mmps may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in addition, h7, staurosporine, cycloheximide and tgf-beta could suppress mmp-2 production. agents that target protein synthesis or the protein kinase c pathway in human pdlfs inhibit mmp-2 production, and such inhibition may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal inflammation. taken together, these findings suggest a possible new therapeutic approach, involving the use of drugs that modify host-response mechanisms to suppress or inhibit mmp-mediated tissue destruction.

TI  == population structure and genetic diversity of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains isolated from localized juvenile periodontitis patients.
AB  == the phylogeny of 20 actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains isolated from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) was investigated by using partial sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes, arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr), and four additional pcr assays that amplified polymorphic regions in the leukotoxin (lkt), cytolethal distending toxin (cdt), major fimbrial subunit (flp-1), and serotype-specific o polysaccharide gene clusters. our analysis also included four strains isolated from healthy subjects and nine reference strains. we found that  a. actinomycetemcomitans strains comprised three major phylogenetic lineages. one lineage consisted of serotype b strains, a second lineage consisted of serotype c strains, and a third lineage consisted of serotype a, d, e, and f strains. 16s rrna sequences within each lineage were highly conserved (<1% base substitutions), whereas sequences between lineages were exceptionally divergent (1.9 to 5.0% substitutions). two strains exhibited 16s rrna sequences that were even more distantly related to those of the three major lineages (2.7 to 6.7% substitutions), indicating that additional minor lineages or variants exist. the  distribution of 16s rrna sequences and lkt, cdt, flp-1, and ap-pcr genotypes was  consistent with a clonal population structure, with little evidence of assortative recombination between strains of different serotypes. strains from all three major lineages were recovered from ljp patients, suggesting that phylogenetically diverse strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans carry pathogenic potential.

TI  == outer membrane-like vesicles secreted by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are enriched in leukotoxin.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is associated with early onset periodontal diseases and secretes membranous vesicles that appear to contain several virulence-associated proteins. however, the composition of these vesicles and the process leading to their secretion are not well defined. electron micrographs of  thin sectioned bacterial cells and purified vesicle preparations showed that vesicles are spherical lipid bilayers, 50-100 nm in diameter, that appear to form by budding from the outer membrane of the bacterium. thin layer chromatography identified the predominant lipid components of vesicles as lipopolysaccharide, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, similar to the main lipid constituents  of the outer membrane. however, vesicles also contained minor lipids that were not detected in outer membrane samples. the major protein constituents of vesicles co-migrated with proteins in outer membrane extracts of a. actinomycetemcomitans, but the outer membrane preparations possessed polypeptides that were not detected in vesicles. three vesicle proteins were identified; the heat-modifiable ompa homologue of a. actinomycetemcomitans, a 28 kda lipoprotein  related to the major outer membrane lipoprotein of mannheimia haemolytica and leukotoxin. incubation of leukotoxin-sensitive human hl60 cells with vesicles from a. actinomycetemcomitans strains jp2 and 652 resulted in cell lysis, indicating that vesicle-associated leukotoxin is biologically active. vesicles from the highly leukotoxic strain jp2 were five- to 10-fold more toxic than vesicles from the minimally leukotoxic 652 strain. furthermore, the specific leukotoxic activity of jp2 vesicles was approximately four- to five-fold higher than isolated outer membrane preparations from jp2, suggesting that vesicles are  enriched in leukotoxin. together, these results suggest that the formation of a.  actinomycetemcomitans vesicles occurs by a process that results in the enrichment of leukotoxin.

TI  == intraoral distribution of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in young adults with minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the intraoral distribution of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in young adults with minor signs of periodontal disease but harboring the organisms in the oral cavity. 17 healthy volunteers, 20 to 27 years of age, participated. samples from mucosal surfaces of the oro-pharyngeal cavity and saliva (n = 221) as well as subgingival plaque from every tooth (n =477) were selectively cultivated for a. actinomycetemcomitans. species identity and presence of the leukotoxin encoding gene, ltxa, were checked by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. moreover, the leukotoxin promoter region  was analyzed. no isolate harbored a 530 bp deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin gene, signaling minimally toxic strains. 42.1 +/- 30.4% extracrevicular and 34.4 +/- 29.5% subgingival samples were culture-positive. in  extracrevicular samples, the organism could easily be recovered from cheek mucosa (62%), saliva (59%) and the palatal tonsils (41%). mean log-transformed numbers of a. actinomycetecomitans colony forming units (cfu/ml) in culture-positive material ranged between 1.8 from the hard palate and 2.3 from 10 microl saliva. the highest prevalence in subgingival plaque was observed at maxillary 3rd molars (55%) followed by maxillary lateral incisors (50%) and mandibular 3rd molars (41%). mean log-transformed counts of cfu/ml ranged between 2.2 at maxillary 3rd  molars and 3.4 at upper central incisors. when adjusted for jaw, site and tooth type, the odds of isolating higher numbers of the organism were increased with every mm probing depth by a factor of 1.35 (p <0.05). the odds ratio for bleeding on probing was 1.38. thus, in this young adult population with minor periodontal  disease, a. actinomyetemcomitans was mainly associated with some deviation from gingival health. of concern might be a minority of subjects (29%) with an extremely wide distribution of the organism in the oral cavity.

TI  == despite large-scale t cell activation, only a minor subset of t cells responding  in vitro to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans differentiate into effector t cells.
AB  == recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has a potent t cell stimulatory effect, activating more than half of all t cells. however, since the fate of these activated t cells was  not known, the present study sought to determine whether all of these t cells differentiate into effector cells. to that end, the intracellular expression of t cell cytokines (il-2, ifn-gamma, il-4 and il-10) in response to a. actinomycetemcomitans was determined by flow cytometry. results demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the expression of the cytokines, most reaching peak levels at 24-48 h. at 48 h, the proportion of t cells expressing each of the cytokines were as follows: il-2 (1.7%+/-0.3), ifn-gamma (1.8%+/-0.5), il-4 (1.0%+/-0.2) and il-10 (1.5%+/-0.5). these data indicated that only 2-5% of all t cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans expressed any t cell cytokines. the finding of large-scale t cell activation in the absence of cytokine expression suggests that the activation of t cells in response to a. actinomycetemcomitans is incomplete. to investigate this phenomenon, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were cultured with a. actinomycetemcomitans for 24 h followed by sorting of the activated (cd69+) cells by immunomagnetic separation and restimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and ionomycin. results demonstrated that nearly 90% of the t cells were unresponsive to further  restimulation. a possible explanation for this unresponsiveness is the induction  of clonal anergy among the responding t cells. to determine possible preferential effects of the stimulation on specific cytokines, the expression of each cytokine among t cells responding to a. actinomycetemcomitans was compared to the maximum  levels achieved by pma + ionomycin stimulation. results showed that number of il-2+ and ifn-gamma+ t cells observed in response to a. actinomycetemcomitans were between 2% and 7% of those seen in response to pma + ionomycin. conversely,  the proportions of t cells expressing il-4 or il-10 were between 35% and 90% of those following stimulation with pma + ionomycin. hence, a. actinomycetemcomitans appears to more preferentially induce t cells expressing il-4 and il-10. collectively, these data suggest that the in vitro stimulation of t cells with a. actinomycetemcomitans leads to partial activation, i.e. only a minor subset of t  cells responding to a. actinomycetemcomitans differentiate into effector cells, while a significant proportion become unresponsive to restimulation, suggesting clonal anergy.

TI  == absence of an especially toxic clone among isolates of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans recovered from army recruits.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a major periodontal pathogen which is associated with early-onset and adult periodontitis. the organism has been shown  to be widely distributed among dentate, healthy individuals as well. it has been  demonstrated that a. actinomycetemcomitans shows great genetic diversity. an especially virulent clone of the organism (jp2-like) with a specific 530-base pair (bp) deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin gene has been isolated from localized juvenile periodontitis patients and related subjects of african and african-american origin. the aim of the present study was to examine  the presence of this specific clone employing specific oligonucleotide primers in a polymerase chain reaction among 51 isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans recovered from 201, 18- to 25-year-old recruits with no or minor periodontal disease. in addition, clinical isolates from 37 periodontitis patients were analyzed as well as reference strains atcc 29524, nctc 9710, y4 and jp2. primers  amplifying a specific 285-bp amplification product in the ltxa region of the leukotoxin gene and a specific 547-bp amplification product of 16 s rrna were used to genetically confirm identification of the organisms. primers amplifying sequences in the leukotoxin promoter region were used to identify the deletion. species specific primers definitively identified all a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates. no isolates from army recruits or the reference strains displayed the deletion in the leukotoxin promoter region. however, in the periodontitis group,  a 24-year-old individual from ghana with localized juvenile periodontitis was identified with an intraoral infection with highly toxic a. actinomycetemcomitans (jp2-like). present results confirm previous observations of absence of a highly  toxic clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans among periodontally healthy and diseased  caucasians as well as a possible presence in localized juvenile periodontitis in  individuals of african origin.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in destructive periodontal disease. three-year follow-up results.
AB  == background: convincing data exist that a. actinomycetemcomitans is an etiologic agent of periodontal disease. the purpose of this longitudinal study was to evaluate a. actinomycetemcomitans as a diagnostic indicator for periodontal disease in treated and periodontally maintained patients. methods: following comprehensive mechanical/surgical and supportive amoxicillin plus metronidazole therapy in 13 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated destructive periodontal disease, we monitored subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans at 4 individual sites in each patient up to 3 years post-therapy. the periodontal status was determined, and a. actinomycetemcomitans levels were quantitatively enumerated on tsbv agar in cfu/ml. six patients with a persistence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans at each reexamination within 3 years post-therapy were selected to be at risk for minor periodontal treatment outcomes and further recurrence of periodontal disease (test group). seven subjects with a complete suppression of a. actinomycetemcomitans at each post-therapy visit served as controls. results: the periodontal parameters decreased from overall values of 6.39 mm (probing depth, pd) and 7.64 mm (clinical attachment level, cal) at the outset to 3.81 mm (pd) and 5.62 mm (cal) 2 years post-therapy (friedman, p< or =0.05). at the 3-year reexamination, the pd/cal scores increased to 4.03/5.78 mm. among the 6 individuals (46%) with persistence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans at the final 3-year visit (test group), periodontal status  yielded increased levels of 4.45 mm (pd) and 6.60 mm (cal). the control subjects  (n = 7) revealed lower values of 3.67 mm (pd) and 5.09 mm (cal). however, on a patient level, during the 3-year observational trial, the periodontal status of the 13 individuals was not statistically affected by subgingival infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: although in advanced periodontal disease,  comprehensive mechanical and antimicrobial treatment is an appropriate regimen for sustained improvement of periodontal health, long-term control of subgingival infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans could not be achieved. in the maintenance care of destructive periodontitis, the persistence of a. actinomycetemcomitans is not a diagnostic parameter for periodontal disease.

TI  == clonal diversity of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans isolates from young adults with minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a major periodontal pathogen which is associated with both early-onset periodontitis and adult cases refractory to conventional periodontal therapy, although the organism has also been shown to be widely distributed among dentate healthy individuals. the observed disease status may be associated with a variation in virulence of different strains or clones. the aim of the present study was to analyse genotype distribution as assessed by  an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) among 51 isolates of a.  actinomycetemcomitans recovered from more than 200 young adult recruits with no or minor periodontal disease. in addition, isolates from 25 periodontitis patients as well as reference strains were genotyped. primers amplifying (i) a specific sequence in the ltxa region, (ii) a specific 16s rrna sequence and (iii) sequences in the leukotoxin promoter region were used to verify species identity  of the strains. three random oligonucleotide primers were employed to analyse genomic polymorphisms of the organism by means of pcr. a total of 19 genotypes could be distinguished, which were grouped by cluster analysis into 5 major clusters based on genetic similarity and a complete linkage sort. whereas 3 clusters assembled a. actinomycetemcomitans genotypes isolated from both healthy  subjects and periodontitis patients, one cluster containing 4 different genotypes exclusively comprised isolates from healthy or gingivitis subjects. another cluster with 2 genotypes consisted of strains originating from periodontitis patients (p < 0.05). one strain characterized by a specific 530 bp deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin region was identified in a ghanese patient  with localized juvenile periodontitis. it was concluded that there is considerable clonal diversity of a. actinomycetemcomitans strains isolated from healthy or periodontally diseased subjects, and that genetically closely related  groups might be associated with health or disease.

TI  == binding of the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == the interaction of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, an important pathogen implicated in juvenile and adult periodontitis, with collagenous and noncollagenous proteins of the extracellular matrix was investigated. a. actinomycetemcomitans suny 465 bound to immobilized type i, ii, iii and v but not type iv collagen. binding to immobilized collagen was saturable and concentration dependent. this interaction could not be inhibited by soluble collagen, suggesting that binding was dependent on a specific collagen conformation. bacteria grown anaerobically exhibited decreased collagen-binding activity as compared with organisms grown acrobically. bacterial outer membrane proteins were essential for binding to collagen. a actinomycetemcomitans suny 465 also bound to immobilized fibronectin. in contrast, bacteria did not bind to fibrinogen, bone sialoprotein, alpha 2-hs glycoprotein or albumin. the mechanism of the interaction with fibronectin was more complex, possibly involving both protein and nonproteinaceous components. the majority of other a. actinomycetemcomitans strains tested bound to extracellular matrix proteins in a manner similar to suny 465 but with minor variation. these results demonstrate that a. actinomycetemcomitans binds to proteins found in connective tissue. the interaction with extracellular matrix proteins may contribute to the virulence of this pathogen at oral and extraoral sites of infection.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. clinical and microbiological baseline data.
AB  == at present, several risk factors for the initiation and progression of periodontitis have been identified. in order to investigate the role of various potential clinical and microbiological risk factors and indicators, a longitudinal study was initiated in a young population deprived from regular dental care. the present communication describes the baseline cross-sectional data obtained in 1987 in terms of the clinical periodontal condition and prevalence of periodontal bacteria in the oral cavity. all inhabitants in the age range 15-25 years of a village with approximately 2000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were examined clinically and microbiologically. in total, 255 adolescents, comprising 130 males and 125 females participated in the study. samples for bacteriological examination were taken from the gingiva, the dorsum of the tongue, and the saliva. plaque index, bleeding upon probing, pocket depth, and attachment loss (al) were scored on the  approximal surfaces from the vestibular aspect of all teeth as well as the mid-vestibular and mid-lingual aspects of the ramfjord teeth. calculus was scored only on the 4 surfaces of the ramfjord teeth. following the clinical measurements, the deepest bleeding pocket with no clinical loss of attachment was sampled for microbiological examination. in addition, in 37 subjects a deep bleeding (> or = 4 mm) with at least 4 mm of attachment loss was sampled. moderate periodontitis (max. al 3-4 mm) was found in 26% of the population, advanced periodontitis (max. al > or = 5 mm) in 8%, whereas 66% of the population showed no or minor periodontitis (max. al 0-2 mm). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found in 57% of the population, porphyromonas gingivalis in 87%, prevotella intermedia and motile rods in all cases and spirochetes in 89%. p. gingivalis (66%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (37%) and spirochetes (63%) were, of all the sampled sites of the oral cavity, most frequently detected in pockets without attachment loss. motile rods were most prevalent on the tongue and in the saliva (92% and 89%, respectively). a high prevalence of the investigated periodontal bacteria was detected both in the pockets without and with attachment loss. no significant association between the  clinical periodontal parameters and the prevalence of the microorganisms was observed at a patient level. at a site level, both p. gingivalis and spirochetes  were more prevalent in sites with attachment loss. the actual role of these putative periodontal pathogens may be elucidated more extensively, when longitudinal data on the present population become available.

AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == racial tropism of a highly toxic clone of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans associated with juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains with enhanced levels of production of leukotoxin are characterized by a 530-bp deletion from the promoter region of  the leukotoxin gene operon. previous isolates with this deletion constituted a single clone belonging to serotype b, although they displayed minor differences among each other. we have analyzed the geographic dissemination of this clone by  examining 326 a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from healthy and periodontally diseased individuals as well as from patients with different types of extraoral infections originating from countries worldwide. a total of 38 isolates, all belonging to the same clone, showed the 530-bp deletion. comparison of a 440-bp sequence from the promoter region of the leukotoxin gene operon from 10 of these  strains revealed complete identity, which indicates that the deletion originates  from a single mutational event. this particular clone was exclusively associated  with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). in at least 12 of 28 families from which the clone was isolated, more than one family member had ljp. notably, all the subjects carrying this clone had a genetic affiliation with the african population. these observations suggest that juvenile periodontitis in some adolescents with an african origin is associated with a disseminating clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == a longitudinal study of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in army recruits.
AB  == during recruiting examinations 201 recruits, 18-25 yr old, were examined for subgingival and extracrevicular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the organism was isolated in 55 subjects, most often at low levels. cluster analysis  revealed 3 clusters with no (a, n = 86) or minor (b, n = 92) periodontal disease  and low dmf-s, as well as established periodontitis, increased d + df-s and high  dmf-s (c, n = 22). when leaving the 12-months' service, 105 recruits were re-examined (54 cluster a, 41 cluster b, 9 cluster c subjects, 1 recruit who was  not clustered). an increase of periodontal probing depth (ppd) of > or = 3 mm at  1 or more sites occurred in 33 subjects: 9 (17%) in cluster a, 16 (39%) in cluster b, 7 (78%) in cluster c and in the not-clustered recruit. considerable variation in frequency distributions of ppd alterations was observed, therefore significant (p < 0.1) mean increase (1-sample t-test) and skew g1 (s-statistic) were additionally considered to define an "active" case. a total of 7 recruits (6.7%) met the criteria. logistic regression analysis revealed a significant influence of self-reported smoking habits on activity status. thus, heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes/d) had a 14-fold higher risk (p = 0.030) for developing or progressing periodontitis compared to non- or light smokers (< 10 cigarettes/d).  in particular, cluster b recruits appeared to have a lower risk (p = 0.11) for developing periodontitis than cluster c recruits (established periodontitis, high dmf-s). a. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated in 29 recruits (27.6%) at baseline  and 30 recruits (28.6%) after 12 months. presence of the organism was not a risk  factor for periodontitis. however, in active subjects, significantly more samples were only a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive at re-examination compared to inactive recruits. it was concluded that smoking is a significant risk factor for periodontitis. subjects with established periodontitis tend to deteriorate further. a. actinomycetemcomitans seems not to increase the risk for developing or progressing periodontitis in this age group. longer studies involving larger populations are needed to confirm these observations.

TI  == potential diagnostic value of sampling oral mucosal surfaces for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in young adults.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of early onset and refractory adult periodontitis. early diagnosis  of colonization of the oral cavity might be of importance in order to initiate preventive measures. the aim of the present study was to determine the potential  diagnostic value of oral mucosal and salivary tests to identify, among healthy young men with no or minor periodontal disease, individuals colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans. two hundred and one male recruits, 18-25 yr of age, took part in the present study. mean values of periodontal parameters suggested only minor periodontal disease. of the sites, 64.8 +/- 17.6% (mean +/- sd) had a periodontal probing depth (ppd) of 1 or 2 mm, only 1.6 +/- 2.9% deep sites of > or = 5 mm were detected. more than 1000 subgingival and extracrevicular samples were selectively cultivated for a. actinomycetemcomitans. the organism was isolated in 55 subjects (27%). the odds for presence of at least 1 deep site of 5 mm was increased by a factor 1.99 if a. actinomycetemcomitans, could be recovered. in identifying subjects colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans, diagnostic test parameters sensitivity and predictive value for a negative test were 74.5 +/- 5.9% and 91.1 +/- 2.3%, respectively, for both saliva and dorsum of tongue samples. in contrast, pooled subgingival plaque from mesial surfaces of 1st molars was only 34.5 +/- 6.4% sensitive; the negative predictive value was 80.2 +/- 3.0%. the results point to a high diagnostic value of oral mucosal and especially saliva samples to identify young adult individuals colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == semiquantitative analysis of periodontopathogens by gene amplification.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, which are known as major causative organisms of periodontitis, were semiquantitatively identified by two-step polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the sets of specific primers for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the lkta and the fima genes, respectively. the set of universal primers for eubacteria was designed from the nucleotide sequence of  a highly conserved region in the eubacterial 16s rrna sequence. the number of bacteria detectable by one-step pcr assay was no fewer than 10(3) cells. less than 10(3) bacterial cells were detectable by two-step pcr assay. subgingival plaque samples from 37 sites of 16 patients were obtained with paperpoints and analyzed by two-step pcr assay. more than 2 x 10(6) bacterial cells were found in the subgingival plaque samples from all diseased sites. in contrast, the number of total bacteria in those from more than half of healthy sites estimated by pcr  assay was less than 2 x 10(6) cells, suggesting that subgingival plaque in diseased sites consists of a relatively larger number of bacteria compared with the population in healthy sites. while a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in both healthy and diseased sites, p. gingivalis was observed only in diseased sites. both periodontopathic bacteria occupied a minor part (less than 0.1%) of the total subgingival plaque bacteria.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) serotypes  to selected antimicrobial agents was investigated by the agar dilution method on  supplemented mueller-hinton test medium. eighty-three a.a. strains, 80 recent isolates from 40 periodontally healthy or diseased subjects, and three type strains were included in the study. serotype a represented 20, serotype b 32, serotype c 17, and serotype e 7 and nontypable 4 of the tested strains. the most  effective drugs against all a.a. serotypes in vitro were cefaclor, cefuroxime, tetracycline hydrochloride, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole), and ciprofloxacin, which inhibited 100% of the strains at 4.0 micrograms/ml, 4.0 micrograms/ml, 1.0 microgram/ml, 2.0 micrograms/ml, 0.06 microgram/ml, and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively. serotypes a and e were more susceptible to cefaclor and cefuroxime than were serotypes b and c; 100% of the first two groups were inhibited at 2.0 micrograms/ml and 1.0 microgram/ml. ampicillin inhibited 92% of the tested strains at 1.0 microgram/ml. serotype b was always susceptible to ampicillin. metronidazole exhibited the best activity against serotype a strains. the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration values for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, doxycycline, and metronidazole were encountered among serotype b isolates. the results of the present study indicate minor differences in the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility patterns  of different a.a. serotypes, except to metronidazole. also, the new oral cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole, rare antimicrobial agents in periodontology, showed promising efficacy against all a.a. strains.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == microbiological and clinical monitoring of non-localized juvenile periodontitis in young adults: a report of 11 cases.
AB  == it has been shown that patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) often harbor actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival area. however, little is known of the oral microflora in non-ljp juvenile periodontitis patients with less extensive disease. the purpose of this study was to describe the microflora and clinical parameters of young adults with minor to moderate periodontitis during treatment for a period of 1 year. eleven patients 15 to 16 years of age were studied. all of them had 4 to 8 mm loss of attachment at minimally one site, but the typical clinical description of localized juvenile periodontitis was an exclusion criterion in this study. microbiological examination of the deepest periodontal pocket and of the tongue revealed that 6 patients harbored actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 5 harbored porphyromonas gingivalis. almost all subjects showed relatively high proportions  of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, motile organisms, and spirochetes. on the basis of clinical and microbiological parameters the 11 patients could be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. six cases had moderate periodontal breakdown with loss of attachment at 7 to 44 sites. all harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and 5 of them p. gingivalis. these 6 cases responded relatively well to initial treatment despite the continued presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the other group consisted of 5 cases with relatively minor periodontal breakdown; i.e, 1 or 2 sites with 4 to 6 mm loss of attachment. neither a. actinomycetemcomitans nor p. gingivalis was detected in the deepest pocket of these patients. all 5 responded well to initial treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
