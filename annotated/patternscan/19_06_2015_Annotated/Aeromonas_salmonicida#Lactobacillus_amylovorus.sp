TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
