TI  == antibacterial activity of phyllantus emblica, coriandrum sativum, culinaris medic, lawsonia alba and cucumis sativus.
AB  == present study deals with the demonstration of the antibacterial activity of very  common medicinal plants of pakistani origin i.e., phyllantus emblica, coriandrum  sativum, culinaris medic, lawsonia alba and cucumis sativus. the extracts were prepared in crude form by the use of hydro-alcoholic solution and were screened for antibacterial activity against various bacterial species by disk diffusion method. assay was performed using clinical isolates of b. cereus, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and e. coli. crude extract of phyllantus emblica fruit exhibited strong activity against standard cultures of all studied bacteria. lawsonia alba  showed good activity against standard cultures of all the used microorganisms. coriandrum sativum was effective only against bacillus cereus, while cucumis sativus and culinaris medic showed poor activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa only. hence, phyllantus emblica exhibited strong antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria it means that phyllantus emblica extract contains some compounds which have broad spectrum of bactericidal activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sequentially extracted organic solvent extracts of fruits, flowers and leaves of lawsonia inermis l. from jaffna.
AB  == objective: to reveal the antibacterial activity of sequentially extracted different cold organic solvent extracts of fruits, flowers and leaves of lawsonia inermis (l. against) some pathogenic bacteria. methods: powders of fruits, flowers and leaves of l. inermis were continuously extracted with dichloromethane (dcm), ethyl acetate and ethanol at ambient temperature. the dried extracts were  prepared into different concentrations and tested for antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method, and also the extracts were tested to determine the available phytochemicals. results: except dcm extract of flower all other test extracts revealed inhibitory effect on all tested bacteria and their inhibitory effect differed significantly (p<0.05). the highest inhibitory effect was showed  by ethyl acetate extract of flower against staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and  pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), and ethyl acetate extract of fruit on escherichia coli (e. coli) and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis). the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flower, fruit and leaf expressed inhibition even at 1 mg/100 microl against all test bacteria. among the tested phytochemicals flavonoids were detected in all test extracts except dcm extract of flower. conclusions: the study demonstrated that the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of fruit and flower of l. inermis are potentially better source of antibacterial  agents compared to leaf extracts of respective solvents.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lawsonia inermis linn (henna) against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antibacterial activity of henna (lawsonia inermis linn) obtained from different regions of oman against a wide array of micro-organisms. methods: fresh henna samples were obtained from different regions of oman as leaves and seeds. 100 g fresh and dry leaves and 50 g of fresh and dry seeds were separately soaked in 500 ml of ethanol for three days, respectively, with frequent agitation. the mixture was filtered, and the crude extract was collected. the crude extract was then heated, at 48 degrees c in a water bath to evaporate its liquid content. the dry crude henna extract was then  tested for its antibacterial activity using well-diffusion antibiotic susceptibility technique. henna extracts were investigated for their antibacterial activity at different concentrations against a wide array of different micro-organisms including a laboratory standard bacterial strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa (nctc 10662) (p. aeruginosa) and eleven fresh clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained from patients attending the sultan qaboos university hospital (squh). 2-hydroxy-p-nathoqinone-tech (2-hpnt, mw=174.16, c10h6o3) was included as control (at 50% concentration) along with the henna samples tested. results: henna samples demonstrated antibacterial activity against all isolates but the highest susceptibility was against p. aeruginosa with henna samples obtained from al-sharqyia region. conclusions: omani henna from al-sharqyia region demonstrates high in vitro anti-p. aeruginosa activity compared with many henna samples from different regions of oman.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of henna extracts.
AB  == lawsonia inermis (henna plant) has been used in herbal medicine for ages. however, the medical benefits of this plant have been discussed in only a few publications. in this study, the antibacterial effects of water, alcoholic and oily extracts of lawsonia inermis leaves against bacterial cultures isolated from various skin diseases were investigated and compared with tetracycline, ampicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics. cultures of staphylococcus  aureus staphylococcus epidermidis (co-agulase negative staphylococci or cons), ss-hemolytic streptococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were obtained from 74 (35 females, 39 males) patients with different skin infections who attended the dermatology outpatient clinic in basra general hospital. the bacterial isolates were treated with l. inermis extracts in vitro. alcoholic and oily extracts were more effective than the water extract which had no effects using standard method of nccl, 2000.alcoholic extracts had the highest antibacterial activity with a mic of 0.125-0.150 microg/ml against ss-hemolytic streptococci and against cons was 0.125-175 microg/ml .oily extracts had a mic of 0.25-0.30 microg/ml against staphylococcus epidermidis (cons). both alcoholic and oily extracts had the same mic (0.5 microg/ml) on staphylococcus aureus. however, alcoholic extracts were more effective on pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mic of 0.5-0.57 microg/ml than oily extract (mic of 0.20-0.28 microg/ml). however, there were no statically differences between the effects of oily and alcoholic henna extracts (p= 0.050).when comparing the extracts' mics with those of antibiotics,  alcoholic extracts showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the isolated bacteria in vitro but oily extracts had much similar mics to those of antibiotics and there are significant difference between effect of both extracts and antibiotics p>0.050.
