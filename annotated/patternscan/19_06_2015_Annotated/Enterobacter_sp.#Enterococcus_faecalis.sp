TI  == extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  == sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter  sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.

TI  == health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  == capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. we surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the alberto lofgren state park, sao paulo, brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. all animals were serologically  negative for rickettsia rickettsii, leishmania spp., and trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), leptospira sp. (26%), and toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. frequently cultured enterobacteria included escherichia coli (61%), enterococcus  casseiflavus (35%), enterococcus faecalis (35%), enterobacter aerogenes (32%), klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and serratia marcescens (32%). no potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. fecal parasitology revealed infection by protozoophaga sp. (58%), viannella spp. (23%), strongyloides spp. (10%), and ancilostomatidae (10%). a total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), a. dubitatum adults (52%), and a. cajennense adults (5%). the capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, leptospira sp., and toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == anti-bacterial studies on hemigraphis colorata (blume) h.g. hallier and elephantopus scaber l.
AB  == objective: to examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, hemigraphis colorata (h. colorata) leaves and stem and elephantopus scaber (e. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected  pathogens. methods: the fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. the dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 ml of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for  preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. results: the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum  ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root and h. colorata leaves and stem  demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the  above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. the results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of h. colorata leaves and stem. the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). the root ethanolic extracts of e. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (24 mm), escherichia coli (e. coli) (16 mm) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) (13 mm). the chlorofrom extracts of e. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against bacillus cereus (b. cereus) (12 mm), the leaves ethanolic extracts of e.  scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz.,  enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) (18 mm), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) (17 mm), salmonella typhi (s. typhi) (14 mm) and enterobacter sp. (11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == effect of low extraction temperatures on microbiological quality of rendered chicken fat recovered from skin.
AB  == ground or finely homogenized skin, inoculated with circa 7 log10 cfu/g of an acinetobacter sp., brochothrix thermosphacta, candida tropicalis, debaryomyces hansenii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterococcus faecalis, a lactobacillus sp., or pseudomonas fluorescens, or not inoculated, was heated to 50 or 80 c to release fat from adipocytes, and the released fat was separated by centrifugation. extraction at 80 c resulted in nearly complete inactivation of indigenous and inoculated flora, resulting in microbiological counts generally below detection level in skin residue and rendered fat. in contrast, large numbers of organisms (3.69 to 7.28 log10 cfu/g) survived the 50 c extraction process. even though the majority (91.5 to 99.9%) of these organisms remained in  the residual skin at the time of fat separation, some organisms were also found occasionally in fat at concentrations of 2.85 to 3.74 log10 cfu/g. therefore, an  additional step such as flash pasteurization is recommended for safety, should extraction temperatures below 80 c be selected.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == controlled comparison of biomerieux vital and bactec nr-660 systems for detection of bacteremia and fungemia in pediatric patients.
AB  == the biomerieux vital automated blood culture system measures a decrease in fluorescence to detect the presence of microorganisms in blood. to assess the performance of vital with aer aerobic medium versus that of the nonradiometric bactec nr-660 peds plus medium for the detection of sepsis in children, a total of 12,146 blood specimens were collected at three university medical centers and  inoculated into aer and peds plus bottles that were weighed before and after filling. the sample volumes were considered adequate in 6,276 bottle pairs. the total yield of isolates was 629, of which 489 (78%) were judged to be the cause of true infections. staphylococci (p < 0.001) and yeasts (p < 0.05) were detected more often in peds plus bottles, as were all microorganisms combined (p < 0.001). the improved detection in the peds plus medium was most marked for patients on antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.001), but remained statistically significant even for patients not on therapy (p < 0.025). there were 431 episodes of sepsis, including 407 considered adequate for analysis. of the 363 unimicrobial episodes, 278 were detected by both bottles, 64 were detected by peds plus bottles only, and 21 were detected by aer bottles only (p < 0.01). no false-negative cultures were detected by terminal subculture of the peds plus bottles when the companion  aer bottle was positive. however, there were 14 false-negative cultures (7 yeasts, 5 staphylococci, 1 enterococcus faecalis, and 1 enterobacter sp.) on terminal subculture of the aer bottles when the companion peds plus bottle was positive. when both systems were positive, the vital system detected bacteria earlier than did the bactec system by a mean of 1.6 h. also, false-positive signals were less common with the vital system. we conclude that the vital system with aer medium must be modified to improve the detection of clinically important staphylococci and yeasts if it is to perform comparably to the bactec nr-660 nonradiometric system with peds plus medium for a pediatric population.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  == we made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (cmz) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with  the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. determination of bacteriological efficacy while 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. isolates obtained  were: 5 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2  strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of neisseria sp., pseudomonas maltophilia, enterobacter sp., alpha-streptococcus, beta-streptococcus and gram-positive cocci. causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the  15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. e. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. as for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. while  an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of cmz administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: e. coli (n = 50), enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  == cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. this study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc). cefoperazone was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive proteus, serratia and  enterobacter sp. particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. the activity of cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci and haemophilus was also determined. in general, the differences between mic and mbc  were minimal. additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
