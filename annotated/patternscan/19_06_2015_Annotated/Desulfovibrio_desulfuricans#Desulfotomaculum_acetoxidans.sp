TI  == stable carbon isotope ratios of lipid biomarkers of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == we examined the potential use of natural-abundance stable carbon isotope ratios of lipids for determining substrate usage by sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb). four srb were grown under autotrophic, mixotrophic, or heterotrophic growth conditions, and the delta13c values of their individual fatty acids (fa) were determined. the fa were usually 13c depleted in relation to biomass, with deltadelta13c(fa - biomass) of -4 to -17 per thousand; the greatest depletion occurred during heterotrophic growth. the exception was desulfotomaculum acetoxidans, for which substrate limitation resulted in biomass and fa becoming isotopically heavier than the acetate substrate. the delta13c values of fa in desulfotomaculum acetoxidans varied with the position of the double bond in the monounsaturated c16 and c18 fa, with fa becoming progressively more 13c depleted  as the double bond approached the methyl end. mixotrophic growth of desulfovibrio desulfuricans resulted in little depletion of the i17:1 biomarker relative to biomass or acetate, whereas growth with lactate resulted in a higher proportion of i17:1 with a greater depletion in 13c. the relative abundances of 10me16:0 in  desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and desulfobacterium autotrophicum were not affected by growth conditions, yet the deltadelta13c(fa - substrate) values of 10me16:0 were considerably greater during autotrophic growth. these experiments indicate that fa delta13c values can be useful for interpreting carbon utilization by srb in natural environments.

TI  == stable carbon isotope fractionation by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == biogeochemical transformations occurring in the anoxic zones of stratified sedimentary microbial communities can profoundly influence the isotopic and organic signatures preserved in the fossil record. accordingly, we have determined carbon isotope discrimination that is associated with both heterotrophic and lithotrophic growth of pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb). for heterotrophic-growth experiments, substrate consumption was monitored to completion. sealed vessels containing srb cultures were harvested at different time intervals, and delta(13)c values were determined for gaseous co(2), organic substrates, and products such as biomass. for three of the four srb, carbon isotope effects between the substrates, acetate or lactate and co(2), and the cell biomass were small, ranging from 0 to 2 per thousand. however, for desulfotomaculum acetoxidans, the carbon incorporated into biomass was isotopically heavier than the available substrates by 8 to 9 per thousand. srb grown lithoautotrophically consumed less than 3% of the available co(2) and exhibited substantial discrimination (calculated as isotope fractionation factors [alpha]), as follows: for desulfobacterium autotrophicum, alpha values ranged from 1.0100 to 1.0123; for desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, the alpha value was 0.0138, and for desulfotomaculum acetoxidans, the alpha value was 1.0310. mixotrophic growth of desulfovibrio desulfuricans on acetate and co(2) resulted in biomass with a delta(13)c composition intermediate to that of the substrates.  the extent of fractionation depended on which enzymatic pathways were used, the direction in which the pathways operated, and the growth rate, but fractionation  was not dependent on the growth phase. to the extent that environmental conditions affect the availability of organic substrates (e.g., acetate) and reducing power (e.g., h(2)), ecological forces can also influence carbon isotope  discrimination by srb.
