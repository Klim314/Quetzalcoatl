TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == microbial diversity in failed endodontic root-filled teeth.
AB  == background: persistent/secondary infections of human root canals play an important role in the failure of endodontic treatment. this study used 16s rrna sequencing to assess microbial diversity in root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. methods: dna was extracted from 15 teeth with persistent intraradicular infections, and the 16s rrna of all present bacteria were amplified by pcr, followed by cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna amplicons. results: all sample extracts were positive for pcr amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers. negative control reactions yielded no amplicons. sixty-five phylotypes belonging to seven phyla were identified from 760 clones; a mean of 9.4 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range 3 - 15). twenty-eight phylotypes were detected in more than one sample, revealing a high inter-sample variability. parvimonas micra (60%, 9/15), solobacterium moore (47%, 7/15), dialister invisus (33%, 5/15), enterococcus faecalis (33%, 5/15), filifactor alocis (27%, 4/15), and fusobacterium nucleatum (27%, 4/15) were the prevalent species. nineteen as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were identified, comprising a substantial proportion of the bacteria in many cases. conclusions: persistent intraradicular infections were present in all root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. the current observations reveal new  candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and phylotypes that may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == in vitro analysis of the cytotoxicity and the antimicrobial effect of four endodontic sealers.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the cytotoxicity  and antibacterial properties of four different endodontic sealers using human periodontal ligament fibroblast cell proliferation and visual analysis of growth  inhibition. methods: a silicone (guttaflow), silicate (endosequence bc), zinc oxide eugenol (pulp canal sealer ewt) and epoxy resin (ah plus jet) based sealer  were incubated with pdl fibroblasts (10(4) cells/ml, n=6) up to 96 h. cell proliferation (rfu) was determined by means of the alamar blue assay. cell growth and morphology was visualized by means of fluorescent dyes. possible antibacterial properties of the different sealers were visualized by means of sem (enterococcus faecalis; parvimonas micra). results: fibroblast proliferation depended on sealer and cultivation time. after 72 and 96 h guttaflow and endosequence bc showed relatively non-cytotoxic reactions, while pulp canal sealer ewt and ah plus jet caused a significant decrease of cell proliferation (p<0.001). visualization of cell growth and morphology with various fluorescent dyes supplemented the results. no antibacterial effect of endosequence bc to p. micra was found, whereas guttaflow showed a weak, pulp canal sealer ewt and ah plus jet extensive growth inhibition. also, no antibacterial effect of guttaflow, endosequence bc or ah plus jet to e. faecalis could be detected. conclusions: these in vitro findings reveal that guttaflow and endosequence bc can be considered as biocompatible sealing materials. however, prior to their clinical employment, studies regarding their sealing properties also need to be considered.
