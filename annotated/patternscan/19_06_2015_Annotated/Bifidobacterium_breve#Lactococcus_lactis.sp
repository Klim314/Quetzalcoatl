TI  == discovering novel bile protection systems in bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 through functional genomics.
AB  == tolerance of gut commensals to bile salt exposure is an important feature for their survival in and colonization of the intestinal environment. a transcriptomic approach was employed to study the response of bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 to bile, allowing the identification of a number of bile-induced genes with a range of predicted functions. the potential roles of a selection of  these bile-inducible genes in bile protection were analyzed following heterologous expression in lactococcus lactis. genes encoding three transport systems belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (mfs), bbr_0838, bbr_0832, and bbr_1756, and three abc-type transporters, bbr_0406-0407, bbr_1804-1805, and  bbr_1826-1827, were thus investigated and shown to provide enhanced resistance and survival to bile exposure. this work significantly improves our understanding as to how bifidobacteria respond to and survive bile exposure.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the immunomodulatory effects of multispecies probiotic formulations for management of allergic diseases.
AB  == modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics could  possibly offer a way of prevention or management of allergic diseases. the objective of this study was to determine the immunomodulating effects of various  multispecies probiotic combinations in vitro, as preamble to application in vivo. multispecies probiotic combinations were formulated and tested for their effects  on in vitro cytokine production by human mononuclear cells and were compared to products that already have shown beneficial effects in vivo. all 4 tested combinations of probiotics showed a 40-71% decrease of th2 cytokine production (il-4, il-5, and il-13) and a variable increase of th1 (ifn-gamma) and treg cytokine (il-10) production compared to the medium. a specific probiotic mixture  that contained bifidobacterium breve w25, bifidobacterium lactis atcc sd 5219, b. lactis atcc sd 5220, lactobacillus plantarum w62, lactobacillus salivarius w57 and lactococcus lactis w19 was superior in its stimulating effect on il-10 production (significant better than the other tested combinations; p=0.001). modulation of in vitro cytokine production profiles can be used to differentiate  between selected probiotic formulations for their immunomodulatory properties. in the future it should be demonstrated whether the immunomodulatory capacities from the multispecies probiotic formulation with the desired profile will be effective in vivo (in adolescents, followed by application in children).

TI  == in vitro screening of probiotics and synbiotics according to anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects.
AB  == there is emerging evidence of the efficiency of probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic treatments in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) and one of their long-term complications, colorectal cancer (crc). in this study, various strains  of probiotic lactic acid bacteria, prebiotic glucooligosaccharides (gos) or a synbiotic combination of the two were screened for anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects in different in vitro models in the context of such diseases. to mimic ibd response to gram negative bacteria, ht-29 cells were sensitised to inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (lps) by ifngamma which increased expression of tlr4, the lps biosensor, and were then treated by probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. secreted il-8 and activated nf-kappab were monitored as inflammation biomarkers. a selection of active strains were then subjected to a second inflammatory cell culture model consisting of inflammatory  activated transgenic caco-2 cells transfected by a reporter gene under the control of nf-kappab inducible promoter. quantification of reporter gene expression allowed us to demonstrate some probiotic inhibitory properties or to confirm such characteristics in two different models. proliferation of cancerous  ht-29 cells was monitored by xtt assay. only three probiotic strains induced a proliferation decrease, but with a lack of reproducibility. binary or ternary probiotic associations, complemented or not by prebiotic gos, significantly decreased proliferation, especially with a synbiotic association of bifidobacterium breve, lactococcus lactis and oligoalternan, a gos. this combination was selected for the following experiments. we showed the involvement of both bacterial and carbohydrate compounds of this synbiotic in the observed effect by dose range tests. we demonstrated that this decrease in proliferation may be due to an induction of a differentiated phenotype, as shown by the up-regulation of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker of differentiation, monitored by real-time rt-pcr in ht-29 cells treated by the selected synbiotics.  thus, this study demonstrates the ability of probiotics to exert anti-inflammatory effects and shows some anti-proliferative characteristics for a specific synbiotics. these products should be further evaluated in animal models  to confirm the in vitro results.

TI  == enhancing bile tolerance improves survival and persistence of bifidobacterium and lactococcus in the murine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == background: the majority of commensal gastrointestinal bacteria used as probiotics are highly adapted to the specialised environment of the large bowel.  however, unlike pathogenic bacteria; they are often inadequately equipped to endure the physicochemical stresses of gastrointestinal (gi) delivery in the host. herein we outline a patho-biotechnology strategy to improve gastric delivery and host adaptation of a probiotic strain bifidobacterium breve ucc2003  and the generally regarded as safe (gras) organism lactococcus lactis nz9000. results: in vitro bile tolerance of both strains was significantly enhanced (p <  0.001), following heterologous expression of the listeria monocytogenes bile resistance mechanism bile. strains harbouring bile were also recovered at significantly higher levels (p < 0.001), than control strains from the faeces and intestines of mice (n = 5), following oral inoculation. furthermore, a b. breve strain expressing bile demonstrated increased efficacy relative to the wild-type  strain in reducing oral l. monocytogenes infection in mice. conclusion: collectively the data indicates that bile tolerance can be enhanced in bifidobacterium and lactococcus species through rational genetic manipulation and that this can significantly improve delivery to and colonisation of the gi tract.

TI  == potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == aim: to analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs). methods: cytokine production and maturation of modcs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and flow cytometric analysis (facs), respectively. the kinetics of mrna expression of cytokine genes was determined by northern blotting. the involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. results: all studied bacteria induced the maturation of modcs in a dose-dependent manner. more detailed analysis with s. thermophilus ths, b. breve bb99, and l. lactis subsp. cremoris arh74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of modc maturation markers hla class ii and cd86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. however, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce modc cytokine gene expression. s. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (tnf-alpha, il-12, il-6, and ccl20) and th1 type (il-12 and ifn-gamma) cytokines, while b. breve and l. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory il-10. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (pi3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. conclusion: our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce modc maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.

TI  == molecular characterization of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 different antibiotics (chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin) were determined for 143 strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria using the etest. different mics were found for different species and strains. based on the distribution of these mic values, most of the strains were either susceptible or intrinsically resistant to these antibiotics. however, the mic range of some of these antibiotics showed a bimodal distribution, which suggested that some of the tested strains possess acquired antibiotic resistance. screening for resistance genes was performed by pcr using specific primers, or using a dna microarray with around 300 nucleotide probes representing 7 classes of antibiotic resistance genes. the genes identified encoded resistance to tetracycline [tet(m), tet(w), tet(o) and tet(o/w)], erythromycin and clindamycin  [erm(b)] and streptomycin [aph(e) and sat(3)]. internal portions of some of these determinants were sequenced and found to be identical to genes described in other bacteria. all resistance determinants were located on the bacterial chromosome, except for tet(m), which was identified on plasmids in lactococcus lactis. the contribution of intrinsic multidrug transporters to the antibiotic resistance was investigated by cloning and measuring the expression of bifidobacterium breve genes in l. lactis.

TI  == two membrane proteins from bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 constitute an abc-type multidrug transporter.
AB  == intrinsic resistance to drugs is one of the main determining factors in bacterial survival in the intestinal ecosystem. this is mediated by, among others, multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters, membrane proteins which extrude noxious  compounds with very different chemical structures and cellular targets. two genes from bifidobacterium breve encoding hypothetical membrane proteins with a high homology with members of the atp-binding cassette (abc) family of multidrug efflux transporters, were expressed separately and jointly in lactococcus lactis. cells co-expressing both proteins exhibited enhanced resistance levels to the antimicrobials nisin and polymyxin b. furthermore, the drug extrusion activity in membrane vesicles was increased when both proteins were co-expressed, compared to membranes in which the proteins were produced independently. both proteins were co-purified from the membrane as a stable complex in a 1:1 ratio. this is believed to be the first study of a functional abc-type multidrug transporter in  bifidobacterium and contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms  underlying the capacity of intestinal bacteria to tolerate cytotoxic compounds.

TI  == investigation of protein export in bifidobacterium breve ucc2003.
AB  == the molecular interactions between the bifidobacterial cell and its natural environment, namely, the gastrointestinal tract of its host, are particularly important in understanding the presumed positive effects of bifidobacterium on the health status of the host. in this study an export-specific reporter system,  designed for use in gram-positive organisms and based on the use of the staphylococcal nuclease (nuc) as a reporter, was employed to identify exported proteins in bifidobacterium breve ucc2003. a b. breve genomic library of translational fusions to the nuc-encoding gene devoid of its own export signal was established in the shuttle vector pfun (i. poquet, s. d. ehrlich, and a. gruss, j. bacteriol. 180:1904-1912, 1998) and screened for bifidobacterial export signals. sequence analysis of the fusion proteins obtained that displayed a nuclease-producing phenotype in both lactococcus lactis and b. breve predicted the presence of a classical signal peptide and/or single or multiple transmembrane domains, thus indicating that some of the export signals in b. breve are comparable to those used in l. lactis. cell fractionation studies, zymograms, nuclease assays, and western blotting were employed to confirm the function of the predicted signals and to determine the location and activity of the exported fusion proteins in b. breve and/or l. lactis.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
