TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - The cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  - AIM: To examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. Samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. Microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (ATB system). The antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. RESULTS: A total number of 54 species were isolated. The most common was E. faecalis followed by Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus spp. Five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. However, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. Radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by Actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococci and Streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. The resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication.

TI  - Combined effect of a mixture of tetracycline, acid, and detergent, and nisin against Enterococcus faecalis and Actinomyces viscosus biofilms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the combined effect of a mixture of tetracycline, acid, and detergent (MTAD) and Nisin against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Actinomyces viscosus (A. viscosus) biofilms. METHODS: This study was conducted between June and December 2013 in collaboration with Dental Caries Research Chair, College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Single-species biofilms (n=9/species/observation period) were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 5, 10, or 15 minute incubation with MTADN (MTAD with 3% Nisin), 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or normal saline. The colony forming units were counted using the Dark field colony counter. RESULTS: A 100% bactericidal effect of 5.25% NaOCl was noted during the 3 observation periods; a significant reduction (p=0.000) in mean survival rates of E. faecalis (77.3+13.6) and A. viscosus (39.6+12.6) was noted after 5 minutes exposure to MTADN compared with normal saline (78000000+5291503) declining to almost no growth after 10 and 15 minutes. The survival rates of the E. faecalis and A. viscosus biofilm were no different after treatment with MTADN and 5.25% NaOCl at the 3 observation periods (p=1.000). CONCLUSION: A combination of MTAD and Nisin was as effective as NaOCl against E. faecalis and A. viscosus biofilms.
TI  - Synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% proteinase K and 2% CHX (with and without ultrasonics). 2% CHX was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (P < 0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase K and CHX group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu mL-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log10 cfu mL-1 ) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu mL-1 ). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase K. CONCLUSION: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.
TI  - Antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (PDT) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during root canal treatment. The aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (CSRBnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. METHODS: The interaction of CSRBnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. Their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (OD260nm) using Enterococcus faecalis. The penetration of CSRBnps into E. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Multispecies biofilms of Streptococcus oralis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. The biofilms were subjected to PDT (60 J/cm(2)) using CSRBnps and rose bengal. The treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and CLSM. RESULTS: The CSRBnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. Atomic force microscopy showed adherence of CSRBnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after PDT. CSRBnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (P < .05). CSRBnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. Scanning electron microscopy and CLSM confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.
TI  - Individual growth detection of bacterial species in an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model.
AB  - Most in vitro studies on the antibacterial effects of antiseptics have used planktonic bacteria in monocultures. However, this study design does not reflect the in vivo situation in oral cavities harboring different bacterial species that live in symbiotic relationships in biofilms. The aim of this study was to establish a simple in vitro polymicrobial model consisting of only three bacterial strains of different phases of oral biofilm formation to simulate in vivo oral conditions. Therefore, we studied the biofilm formation of Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) on 96-well tissue culture plates under static anaerobic conditions using artificial saliva according to the method established by Pratten et al. that was supplemented with 1 g l(-1) sucrose. Growth was separately determined for each bacterial strain after incubation periods of up to 72 h by means of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and live/dead staining. Presence of an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was visualized by Concanavalin A staining. Increasing incubation times of up to 72 h showed adhesion and propagation of the bacterial strains with artificial saliva formulation. An and Ef had significantly higher growth rates than Fn. Live/dead staining showed a median of 49.9 % (range 46.0-53.0 %) of living bacteria after 72 h of incubation, and 3D fluorescence microscopy showed a three-dimensional structure containing EPS. An in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model was established to better simulate oral conditions and had the advantage of providing the well-controlled experimental conditions of in vitro testing.
TI  - Improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-II photosensitizers.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. This demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) uses light activated photosensitizers (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. Positively charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of PS for light-mediated killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield PhiDelta of >97%. Upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase C8, 1260 +/- 50 mW/cm(2)) the PS showed high activity against the oral key pathogens Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. At a concentration of 10 muM, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 J/cm(2)) after one single treatment. The pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.
TI  - Characterisation of the antibacterial effect of polyethyleneimine nanoparticles in relation to particle distribution in resin composite.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterise the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating cross-linked quaternised polyethyleneimine (QPEI) nanoparticles in relation to their distribution in the bulk material. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating QPEI nanoparticle was tested against various oral pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscousus, Lactobacilus casei and whole saliva. Nanoparticle distribution in the modified resin composite was assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the degree of conversion was recorded. RESULTS: Total bacterial inhibition was detected against all the tested pathogens following direct contact with the outer surface of the modified resin composite. Similarly, the inner surface of the modified resin composite caused total inhibition. Electron microscope images showed bacterial death. XPS revealed surface I(-) ions on both the outer and the inner surfaces of the modified composite. No I(-) ions were detected in the unmodified composite. Nanoparticle distribution was higher on the inner surface of the modified composite. The composite's degree of conversion was unaffected by nanoparticle addition. CONCLUSIONS: QPEI nanoparticles represent a new generation of antibacterial nanoparticles which are highly promising in preventing bacterial recontamination when restoring teeth.
TI  - New bacterial composition in primary and persistent/secondary endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to analyze the microbiota of primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections of patients undergoing endodontic treatment with respect to clinical and radiographic findings. METHODS: Samples from the root canals of 21 German patients were taken using 3 sequential sterile paper points. In the case of a root canal filling, gutta-percha was removed with sterile files, and samples were taken using sterile paper points. The samples were plated, and microorganisms were then isolated and identified morphologically by biochemical analysis and sequencing the 16S rRNA genes of isolated microorganisms. RESULTS: In 12 of 21 root canals, 33 different species could be isolated. Six (50%) of the cases with isolated microorganisms were primary, and 6 (50%) cases were endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth. Twelve of the isolated species were facultative anaerobic and 21 obligate anaerobic. Monomicrobial infections were found for Enterococcus faecalis and Actinomyces viscosus. E. faecalis was most frequently isolated in secondary endodontic infections (33%). Moraxella osloensis was isolated from a secondary endodontic infection that had an insufficient root canal filling accompanied by a mild sensation of pain. A new bacterial composition compromising Atopobium rimae, Anaerococcus prevotii, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Dialister invisus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses. CONCLUSIONS: New bacterial combinations were found and correlated to clinical and radiographic findings, particularly to chronic apical abscesses. M. osloensis was detected in root canals for the second time and only in German patients.
TI  - In vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. The role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of three oral rinses, Acclean, Noplak and Prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. Oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an MTT assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an XTT assay. RESULTS: The two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio lm-grown organisms when compared to the Prevention oral rinse. CONCLUSION: Both Acclean and Noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. In addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. However, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. In this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. METHODS: Antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin G, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized Etest method (Bio Merieux, Marcy-1'Etoile, France). The antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. Additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. RESULTS: Different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. Five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermentum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella buccae, and Propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. Most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.
TI  - The effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  - AIM: To establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K with or without ultrasonic activation. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. The treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase K, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (with and without ultrasonics). NaOCl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: Nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium pH became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. The CLSM showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. On the disc model, trypsin and proteinase K were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. NaOCl was the most effective agent (P < 0.001). In the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (P < 0.05). Chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase K (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (P < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/- 4.9). CONCLUSION: Trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. METHODS: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and 50 mug/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. RESULTS: Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (P < .001). The HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBD3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial efficacies of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic irrigation systems in vitro.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To ensure root canal treatment success, endodontic microbiota should be efficiently reduced. The in vitro bactericidal effects of a hydrodynamic system and a passive ultrasonic irrigation system were compared. METHODS: Single-rooted extracted teeth (n = 250) were contaminated with suspensions of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, mixed aerobic cultures, or mixed anaerobic cultures. First, the antibacterial effects of the hydrodynamic system (RinsEndo), a passive ultrasonic irrigation system (Piezo smart), and manual rinsing with 0.9% NaCl (the control) were compared. Colony-forming units were counted. Second, the 2 systems were used with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) alone or NaOCl + 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX). The colony-forming units in the treated and untreated roots were determined during a period of 5 days. RESULTS: Both irrigation systems reduced bacterial numbers more effectively than manual rinsing (P < .001). With NaCl, ultrasonic activated irrigation reduced bacterial counts significantly better than hydrodynamic irrigation (P = .042). The NaOCl + CHX combination was more effective than NaOCl alone for both systems (P < .001), but hydrodynamic irrigation was more effective with NaOCl + CHX than the passive ultrasonic irrigation system. CONCLUSIONS: Both irrigation systems, when combined with NaOCl + CHX, removed bacteria from root canals.
TI  - Photodynamic biofilm inactivation by SAPYR--an exclusive singlet oxygen photosensitizer.
AB  - Prevention and control of biofilm-growing microorganisms are serious problems in  public health due to increasing resistances of some pathogens against antimicrobial drugs and the potential of these microorganisms to cause severe infections in patients. Therefore, alternative approaches that are capable of killing pathogens are needed to supplement standard treatment modalities. One alternative is the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB). The lethal effect of PIB is based on the principle that visible light activates a photosensitizer, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g., singlet oxygen, which induces phototoxicity immediately during illumination. SAPYR is a new generation of photosensitizers. Based on a 7-perinaphthenone structure, it shows a singlet oxygen quantum yield PhiDelta of 99% and is water soluble and photostable. Moreover, it contains a positive charge for good adherence to cell walls of pathogens. In this study, the PIB properties of SAPYR were investigated against monospecies and polyspecies biofilms formed in vitro by oral key pathogens. SAPYR showed a dual mechanism of action against biofilms: (I) it disrupts the structure of the biofilm even without illumination; (II) when irradiated, it inactivates bacteria in a polymicrobial biofilm after one single treatment with an efficacy of >/= 99.99%. These results encourage further investigation on the potential of PIB using SAPYR for the treatment of localized infectious diseases.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from dugongs (Dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in Queensland, Australia, 2000-2011.
AB  - Microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (Dugong dugon). This study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the University of Queensland's School of Veterinary Science for postmortem examination. Thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. The most abundant bacteria included Aeromonas spp., Clostridium spp., Vibrio spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas spp. In six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. Mixed infections containing Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp.; Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, and Serratia marcescens; and Actinomyces spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and Enterococcus faecalis was associated with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. Clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. The significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. It is also difficult to fulfil Koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. Regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of three new and two established root canal irrigation solutions.
AB  - This study sought to assess the efficacy of two established and three relatively  new root canal irrigants against five different microorganisms using the agar diffusion method. Sodium hypochloride (NaOCl)-based irrigants demonstrated the most effective antimicrobial activity.
TI  - The effects of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium enrich mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Calcium Enrich Mixture) CEM (mixed with different concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cements used in this in vitro study included Gray proRoot MTA and CEM with the microorganisms being entrococcus faecalis, streptococcus muntas, Candida albicans, Actinomyces, Escherichia coli, and a mixture of these microorganisms. CHX was used in the form of liquid at 0.2%, 2%, and 0.12% concentrations. Contact dilution and colony count method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of these cements. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour intervals, we cultured the samples on blood agar medium. Colonies were counted after incubation at 37 degrees . Data were statistically analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the antimicrobial activity of MTA and CEM. RESULTS: All concentrations of CHX were mixed with MTA and the CEM had antibacterial activities on all microorganisms' strains except for the Enterococcus faecalis and the mixture group. MTA had better antibacterial activity than the CEM, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.13). The mixing of MTA and the CEM with CHX significantly increased the antibacterial properties of both cements (P < 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the different concentrations of CHX. The antibacterial activity of the materials increased through time. CONCLUSION: The mixture of MTA and CEM with different concentration of CHX significantly increased the antibacterial activity.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. METHODS: Four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. Simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. The LIVE/DEAD BacLight technique (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). Redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. RESULTS: The 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. The biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. A high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. The community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which E. faecalis, L. salivarius, and S. gordonii were most abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. This multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.
TI  - Effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and Streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  - Dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  Controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. Chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and S. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. Cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) was investigated. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. Live/Dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), was used to observe and analyze S. mutans biofilms. MIC and MBC results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. Lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by SEM. Furthermore, CLSM images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against S. mutans biofilms. Toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of HGFs in 5 min. Our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.
TI  - Short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (SZ) to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC #29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC#25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #27853), Candida albicans (ATCC #90028), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC #33277), Actinomyces israelii (ATCC #12102), and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC# 15032). SZ was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to MTA powder. The control group was MTA powder with no SZ. The antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed MTA specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. The amounts of silver ion release from MTA specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. The pH of MTA specimens was measured with a pH meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. MTA with 2% and 0.2% SZ specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for P. intermedia and A. israelii. MTA without SZ inhibited C. albicans, E. Coli, and P. intermedia. The highest silver release was detected in 2% SZ MTA at 24 h. The incorporation of SZ may enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Identification of dominant pathogens in periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to identify dominant pathogens in the periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. METHODS: thirty-three root-filled teeth with persistent apical periodontitis referred for surgical treatment were selected. Microbial samples were collected from the periapical lesions during apical surgery. Microbial identification was performed with species-specific primers prepared according to the sequence analysis data using a 16S rRNA technique. RESULTS: among the 33 cases, in 5 cases none of the target species were detected, 6 cases showed the presence of only one species, and 22 cases showed more than two species. Porphyromonas endodontalis (45% of sample) was the most commonly detected dominant microbial species in the study sample, followed by Actinomyces viscosus (42%), Candida albicans (36%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (27%). Fusobacterium, Actinomyces israelii and Enterococcus faecalis were also detected in 27%, 21% and 15% of the sample, respectively. The most frequently isolated species, P. endodontalis, was in most cases detected together with Actinomyces (14 cases) and P. gingivalis (6 cases). None of the lesions analysed in the present study contained Prevotella intermedia. There was no correlation in relation to the presence of sinus tracts and the bacterial species. CONCLUSION: a mixed population of pathogens was found in the endodontic lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. P. endodontalis, A. viscosus, C. albicans and P. gingivalis were the dominant species identified.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - [Effect of compound Chinese traditional medicine on infected root canal bacteria  biofilm].
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of compound Chinese traditional medicine(CTM), which composed of gallic acid, magnolol and polysaccharide of Blettila striata, against the infected root canal bacterial biofilm. METHODS: Actinomyces viscosus (Av), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) were composed to form biofilm, then confocal laser scan microscope (CLSM) was used to observe and study the bacterial activity. SAS6.12 software package was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The biofilm thickness reduced after treatment by both CTM and ZnO (P>0.05),while there was a significant decrease of the percentage of vital bacterias after treatment by CTM (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The compound Chinese traditional medicine is effective on biofilm control, so that it would be an effective disinfecting drug for root canal sealers. Supported by Research Fund of Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanghai Municipality (Grant No.2008L008A).
TI  - [Etiology and treatment strategy of refractory periapical periodontitis].
AB  
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (NEC), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland.
AB  - Using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), new endodontic cement (NEC) and Portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar for Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538) and Candida (ATCC 10231). For Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541) and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) blood agar medium was used. Wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. The positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for Enterococcus faecalis. NEC created larger inhibition zones than MTA and Portland cement. This difference was significant for Portland cement (P < 0.05), but not for MTA (P > 0.05). Among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for Actinomyces group (P < 0.05). The antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (P < 0.05). It was concluded that NEC is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of intracanal medicaments on the external root surface.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess in vitro the antimicrobial action of intracanal medicaments in the external root surface, with or without of cementum. METHODS: After the placement of intracanal medicaments, the coronal and apical openings were sealed. The antimicrobial action of 2% chlorhexidine gel (2%CHX); calcium hydroxide+2% chlorhexidine gel (CH+2%CHX); calcium hydroxide+2% chlorhexidine gel+zinc oxide (CH+2%CHX+ZnO); calcium hydroxide+saline solution (CH+SS) was evaluated against Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Actinomyces viscosus and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The samples were placed over the agar, and the zones of inhibition of microbial growth were measured after the incubation period. RESULTS: The antimicrobial effects of the medicaments could be ranked from strongest to weakest as follows: 2%CHX, CH+2%CHX, CH+2%CHX+ZnO, CH+SS. No differences among groups were verified in the presence or absence of cementum. CONCLUSIONS: 2%CHX containing medicaments diffused into the dentin and reached the outer surface, exerting antimicrobial action.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Impact of growth conditions on susceptibility of five microbial species to alkaline stress.
AB  - The effects of different growth conditions on the susceptibility of five taxa to  alkaline stress were investigated. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were grown as planktonic cells, allowed to adhere to dentin for 24 hours, grown as monospecies or multispecies biofilms on dentin under anaerobic conditions with a serum-enriched nutrient supply at 37 degrees C for 5 days. In addition, suspended biofilm microorganisms and 5-day old planktonic multispecies cultures were used. Microbial recovery upon direct exposure to saturated calcium hydroxide solution (pH 12.5) for 10 and 100 minutes was compared with control exposure to physiologic saline. Planktonic microorganisms were most susceptible; only E. faecalis and C. albicans survived in saturated solution for 10 minutes, the latter also for 100 minutes. Dentin adhesion was the major factor in improving the resistance of E. faecalis and A. naeslundii to calcium hydroxide, whereas the multispecies context in a biofilm was the major factor in promoting resistance of S. sobrinus to the disinfectant. In contrast, the C. albicans response to calcium hydroxide was not influenced by the growth condition. Adherence to dentin and interspecies interactions in a biofilm appear to differentially affect the sensitivity of microbial species to calcium hydroxide.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (RCM) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. STUDY DESIGN: The antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted and tested against anaerobic bacteria Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, and Clostridium perfringens and against Enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL standardized inocula. The tubes were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. Blood agar RCM subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. RESULTS: All drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. E. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and RCM broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. Ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of EEP.
TI  - Surface antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) is recommended for use worldwide, not only in developing countries where resources are not readily available, but also in more industrialized countries. The antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials may improve the restorative treatment outcome. Glass ionomer cement (GIC) has been advocated as the preferred restoration material for ART. The authors evaluated the antibacterial properties of restorative materials-three GICs and a zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE)-in vitro. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis were the test microorganisms. The authors used a quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the restorative materials using the direct contact test (DCT) of freshly prepared and one-week-aged materials. RESULTS: The freshly prepared GICs and ZOE showed no bacterial growth in all tested bacteria compared with a control. This effect lasted for at least one week for S. mutans and A. viscosus but not for E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional GICs used in ART showed antibacterial surface properties against cariogenic bacteria for at least one week. Further study on the long-term antimicrobial effects of GICs is needed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The antimicrobial properties of freshly prepared restorative materials and aged restorative materials used in ART have a potent effect against cariogenic bacteria. These properties have crucial importance in preventing secondary caries.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez on five common endodontic pathogens.
AB  - Microbial control of the root canal system is one of the key objectives of root canal therapy. Triclosan is a widely accepted broad spectrum antimicrobial agent proven to be effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Triclosan acts by blocking bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. The addition of Gantrez copolymer has been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of triclosan. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez against Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both test solutions was determined for each of the 5 microorganisms by using microtiter serial dilutions. Samples were streaked on 5% sheep blood agar plates and placed in an anaerobic incubator to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The MBC of triclosan ranged from 12-94 microg/mL. The MBC of triclosan with Gantrez ranged from <0.3-10.4 microg/mL. The addition of Gantrez enhanced the bactericidal activity of triclosan. Both triclosan and triclosan with Gantrez demonstrated bactericidal activity against the 5 specific endodontic pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  - AIM: To define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. METHODOLOGY: The hypothesis was tested ex vivo that Nd:YAG laser irradiation has a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. Resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (CSEM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct Nd:YAG laser irradiation, respectively. RESULTS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation (1.5 W, 15 Hz, four times for 5 s) of Enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a 99.7% kill, but no sterilization. The CSEM procedure verified that the extent of radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. After 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of Actinomyces naeslundii or Streptococcus anginosus were discernible. However, when micro-colonies of S. anginosus and specially biofilms of E. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using ESEM and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. Endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of medicated root canal filling materials.
AB  - Bacteria remaining within the root canal system are a significant factor in endodontic failures. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha formulations against common endodontic pathogens. Standard, tetracycline, or iodoform (also called medicated gutta-percha; MGP) containing gutta-percha were tested against Actinomyces israelii, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum using the agar diffusion method. Resilon points and tetracycline disks/E-tests were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Resilon did not display antimicrobial properties. Standard gutta-percha and MGP inhibited F. nucleatum and A. naeslundii, with MGP also inhibiting A. israelii. Tetracycline containing gutta-percha was found to inhibit growth from all four bacterial species tested. The results of this study suggest that the use of tetracycline containing gutta-percha as an obturation material may be useful as a complement to the cleaning and disinfection phase of root canal procedures.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. The results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. Sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. In conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of varying concentrations of sodium hypochlorite on the endodontic microorganisms Actinomyces israelii, A. naeslundii, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the resistance of microorganisms associated with refractory endodontic infections to sodium hypochlorite used as a root canal irrigant. METHODOLOGY: Two strains each of Actinomyces naeslundii, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis were tested as late logarithmic phase inocula, against sodium hypochlorite adjusted to 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.25% w/v. Contact times used were 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 s. In the case of E. faecalis, additional experiments used contact times of 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 30.0 min. Anti-microbial action was halted by sodium thiosulphate addition. Survivors were measured primarily using viable counts on drop plates. Additionally, pour plates were used to count low colony-forming units (cfu) and dilutions to 10(-6) were used to count high cfu. RESULTS: All concentrations of NaOCl lowered cfu below the limit of detection after 10 s in the case of A. naeslundii and C. albicans. However, E. faecalis proved to be more resistant to NaOCl. Using 0.5% NaOCl for 30 min reduced cfu to zero for both strains tested. This compares with 10 min for 1.0%, 5 min for 2.5% and 2 min for 5.25% (P < 0.001). Regression analysis for the dependent variable log(e)(count + 1) with log(e)(time + 1) and concentration as explanatory variables gave rise to a significant interaction between time and concentration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The published association of E. faecalis with refractory endodontic infection may result, at least partially, from high resistance of this species to NaOCl. This does not appear to be the case with A. naeslundii or C. albicans.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.

TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. METHODOLOGY: Sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. During nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was removed and the canals were sampled. Microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. The association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth. In most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. Of the microbial species isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% Gram-positive microorganisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. Obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was Peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (P < 0.01). Significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (P < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and Prevotella intermedia/P. nigrescens (P < 0.05); (c) sinus and Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001) or Actinomyces spp. (P < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and Streptococcus spp. or Candida spp. (both with P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly Gram-positive microbial species. Facultative anaerobes, especially E. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.
TI  - Evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. Microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. A total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. The bacterial genera most frequently recovered were Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Actinomyces. Antibiotic sensitivity of Enterococcus faecalis and Peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the E-test system. All species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. However, 20% of the E.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. It was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. E.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Bacteriophage isolation from human saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteriophages for Gram-positive oral pathogens in human saliva.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples from 31 donors were screened for the presence of bacteriophages for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteriophages for Enterococcus faecalis were found in seven samples. Enterococcus faecalis phages were still present in saliva re-collected from one donor one month, and one year after initial saliva collection. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and stability of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages in human saliva suggests a possible role of these bacteriophages in the oral ecosystem. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phage therapy as a way to control oral bacteria might be considered.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteriological cultures of removed intrauterine devices and pelvic inflammatory  disease.
AB  - Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are highly effective, long-term methods of contraception. Although evidence of a direct association between IUD use and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is scarce, concerns about PID related to IUDs use has limited their use throughout the world. We designed this study to examine the effect of IUDs on PID. For the study, we recruited 200 participants from among women who requested an IUD as a means of contraception. The IUDs were removed 36 months later or in case of PID. No PID cases were recorded during the follow-up period. Prior to IUD insertion, 121 women (60.5%) had symptoms and/or signs of lower genital tract infection, whereas during the follow-up period 179 women (89.5%) had symptoms and/or signs of lower genital tract infection. The Papanicolaou smears were negative for Actinomyces throughout the study period. Also, cultures for sexualy transmitted disease microorganisms were negative throughout the study period. Following IUD removal, 189 IUD cultures (94.5%) were positive. The bacterial flora of the removed IUDs consisted of common aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that do not account for PID. The most common microorganisms identified were Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Eschericia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. IUDs are a very effective and safe method of contraception if potential recipients are selected carefully. Culture of the removed IUDs and therapeutic management of women with positive cultures are not recommended when women are asymptomatic for PID.
TI  - Actinomyces species, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Actinomyces species,  streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. Samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples. All root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, Actinomyces species in 9.4%, and E. faecalis in 7.5%. The most prevalent species were members of the Streptococcus anginosus group. With regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most prevalent species were S. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), E. faecalis (11.5%), and S. anginosus (7.7%). S. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). The other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were A. gerencseriae (14.8%), S. gordonii (11.1%), S. intermedius (11.1%), A. israelii (7.4%), S. anginosus (7.4%), and S. sanguis (7.4%). S. constellatus was the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Bacteria isolated after unsuccessful endodontic treatment in a North American population.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial flora present in teeth after the failure of root canal therapy in a North American population. These results were then compared with those of the previous Scandinavian studies. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-four root-filled teeth with persistent periapical radiolucencies were selected for retreatment. After removal of the root-filling material, the canals were sampled with paper points, and by reaming of the apical dentin. Both samples were grown under aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions. Then the bacterial growth was analyzed. RESULTS: The microbial flora was mainly of 1 to 2 strains of predominantly gram-positive organisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most commonly recovered bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were cultivated in 34 of the 54 teeth examined in the study. E faecalis was identified in 30% of the teeth with a positive culture.
TI  - Penetration of bacteria in bovine root dentine in vitro.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a test model to quantify the penetration of bacteria into dentinal tubules. METHODOLOGY: The model consisted of two compartments separated by a bovine dentine specimen with a thickness of 1.5-3.1 mm. The root cementum was removed from the root surface and the specimens were oriented in the model with the pulpal side facing the inoculated chamber of the test model. One compartment contained the test organism and the other was filled with sterile broth that was evaluated for growth of the test organism. The depth of bacterial penetration was measured in the dentine with or without a smear layer using both a histological and a quantitative recovering grinding technique, after 6 weeks of exposure to the microorganisms. RESULTS: E. faecalis penetrated dentine significantly deeper than A. israelii (P < 0.001). After removal of the smear layer with EDTA, E. faecalis penetrated significantly deeper than in dentine pretreated with saline only (P < 0.01) or with a combination of saline and sodium hypochlorite (P < 0.01). Microorganisms were found in 89% of the cultured specimens and in 80% of the specimens that were evaluated with light microscopy. Total penetration through the dentine specimen and infection of the broth in the test compartment of the model occurred in only two out of 72 specimens. CONCLUSION: Collection and immediate culturing of infected dentine dust and counting colony forming units (CFU) allowed an overview of the number of bacteria per sample and was more sensitive than microscopy. Removal of the smear layer enhanced bacterial penetration.
TI  - Microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  - Dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. However, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. Therefore, this study examined bone debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. Twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the Frios Bone Collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. In group S (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. In group NS (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was achieved using the same suction tip. Bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. Colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. Twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes Actinomyces odontolyticus, Eubacterium sp., Prevotella intermedia, Propionibacterium propionicum and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. In group S (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group NS, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (P=0.001). Gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. It is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Cell wall-anchored CshA polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in Streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  - It has been shown previously that inactivation of the cshA gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kDa) in the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii, generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral Actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. We now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) cells, bind CshA-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of cshA mutants. To more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of CshA, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire cshA gene into the replicative plasmid pAM401 and expressed full-length CshA polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. Enterococci expressing CshA exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell surface hydrophobicity over E. faecalis JH2-2 carrying the pAM401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. CshA expression in E. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind Actinomyces naeslundii cells. Electron micrographs of negatively stained E. faecalis cells expressing CshA showed peritrichous surface fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control E. faecalis JH2-2(pAM401) cells. The fibrils bound CshA-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of E. faecalis cells to fibronectin. The results demonstrate that the CshA polypeptide is the structural and functional component of S. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.
TI  - Binding properties of Streptococcus gordonii SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated SspA (1,542 amino acid residues) and SspB (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. These polypeptides are members of the antigen I/II family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as Actinomyces naeslundii. To determine if SspA and SspB have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspA and sspB genes were cloned into expression plasmid vector pTREX1-usp45LS to generate pTREX1-sspA and pTREX1-sspB, respectively, and the Ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface SspA or SspB polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen I/II polypeptide substrates. More than twice as many L. lactis cells expressing SspA bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG) as did L. lactis cells expressing SspB. In contrast, lactococci expressing SspB adhered twice as well as lactococci producing SspA to collagen type I and to Candida albicans. The binding of A. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of Ssp polypeptides. L. lactis(pTREX1-sspB) cells bound in greater numbers to SAG than did Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells expressing SspB from pAM401EB-5. The results suggest that SspA and SspB have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by S. gordonii.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. Baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the Mann-Whitney test. Most of the 40 species tested, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. Prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus constellatus. The odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if S. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total DNA probe count. Since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using DNA probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. The remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Gemella haemolysans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera Bartonella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Eubacterium, Rothia, Gordona, Gemella, Corynebacterium, Leptotrichia, and Actinomyces. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. As a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of S. constellatus were found.
TI  - Acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  - Using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the pH-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results in enhanced survival at low pH. The lower pH limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of Neisseria A182 at pH 6.34; growth of Lactobacillus casei RB1014 stopped at pH 3.81, with species of Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Prevotella and Streptococcus falling between these limits. The working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher pH limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. Adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal pH would trigger the induction of a mechanism that would enhance survival at a pH killing pH 7.5 control cells. The killing pH varied from pH 4.5 for Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 to pH 2.3 for the three Lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three Streptococcus mutans strains killed at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal pH values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the pH list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two pH values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at pH values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at pH 7.5. Predominant among the latter group were the S. mutans and Lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive response exhibited by S. mutans LT11 and S. mutans Ingbritt, involving a process that required protein synthesis. Time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering pH before the acid response was fully functional. These results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as Enterococcus faecalis, to pH values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below pH 3.5.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Disinfection by calcium hydroxide pastes of dentinal tubules infected with two obligate and one facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Bovine dentine cylinders were experimentally infected with Actinomyces israelii,  Fusobacterium nucleatum, or Enterococcus faecalis. The latter is a facultative anaerobic bacteria and the others are obligate anaerobes commonly found in endodontic infections. The infected specimens were exposed to pastes of calcium hydroxide mixed with saline solution or camphorated paramonochlorophenol for periods of 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week. The viability of bacteria after these exposure times was evaluated by specimen incubation in culture medium to compare the effectiveness of the pastes in disinfecting dentinal tubules. The calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol paste effectively killed bacteria in the tubules after a 1-h period of exposure, except for E. faecalis that required one day of exposure. In contrast, the calcium hydroxide/saline paste was ineffective against E. faecalis and F. nucleatum even after 1 week of exposure. The results showed that camphorated paramonochlorophenol increased the antibacterial effects of calcium hydroxide.
TI  - Serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  - This study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. A total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the following age groups: 20-39 years (group A), 40-59 years (group B), 60-79 years (group C) and 80+ years (group D). Only significantly lower mean IgM antibody levels to Streptococcus mutans strain Guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (P < 0.001). With Actinomyces viscosus NCTC 10951 significantly reduced IgM levels (P < 0.02) and significantly elevated IgA levels were observed with increased age (P < 0.05). IgA and IgG antibodies to Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (P < 0.001), whilst a trend toward lower levels of IgM antibodies was recorded with age. No changes in IgA antibodies to Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 were observed but the lowest level of IgM antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (P < 0.05). Mean specific activity was decreased with age with IgM antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with IgG and IgA antibodies to E. coli. Overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum IgM antibody responses. This impairment in the circulatory IgM immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.
TI  - A scanning electron microscopic evaluation of in vitro dentinal tubules penetration by selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro root canal dentinal tubule invasion by selected anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated from endodontic infections was evaluated. Dentinal cylinders obtained from bovine incisors were inoculated with bacteria, and microbial penetration into tubules was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that all bacterial strains tested were able to penetrate into dentinal tubules, but to different extents.
TI  - Pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using Teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root canal bacteria. Models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus faecalis, and Porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. Severe inflammation occurred around the models. Among them, P. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. Further study using P. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. Tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. However, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. Consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - [The bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal].
AB  - The objective of this paper was to determine the quantitative bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal. Four test organisms found frequently in the root canal were compared. The result showed ultrasonic can kill the test organisms effectively in the root canals. The best bactericidal efficiency occurred at 4 or 5 min. of ultrasonic though the more efficiency as the time longer. Bactericidal irrigation could increase the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic and its bactericidal action similar to irrigation bactericidal property.
TI  - Salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of Streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  - Interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. Streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. The salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. Salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis or A. viscosus. Adherence of S. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. Expression of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) gene in Enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus. This interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. The results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis and A. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on S. mutans.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  - Ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. In addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. Fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. The most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, black-pigmented Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented Bacteroides, Veillonella, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans. Of the 50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. This study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - [Chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. Murine peritoneal PMN was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. The PMN response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the CL response were also measured. The bacteria which could induce a high level of CL response of PMN were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were Staphylococcus subsp. and Actinomyces subsp.; low levels were Lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of Streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Phagocytic indexes of PMN to various kind of bacteria were distributed from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 PMN were 27 to 301. There was no correlation between CL values and phagocytic indexes or between CL values and the bacterial number in 100 PMN by limiting the data on Staphylococcus, Streptococcus subsp. and Lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. There was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from PMN by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of PMN. Either catalase activities or SOD activities were measured by H2O2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. Neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of CL response.
TI  - Apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  - Experimental infections in root canals with Streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (Strep-MC4). Actinomyces bovis (Act-MC6) and Bacteroides oralis (Bact-MC3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. The immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. The antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. In 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. After 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and histologically examined. The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. The cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. The radiographic and histologic examinations revealed no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number of teeth with periapical lesions. The radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. Histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. In the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. Mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.
TI  - Bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  - We investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (CF) on 14C-labeled Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and on whole dental plaque. CF was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. CF supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from Streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the CF supernate. The findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. On the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed CF pellet were inactive. Further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by CF from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The role of bacteriolytic factors, present in CF, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.
TI  - Viable and total cell masses in dental plaque as measured by bioluminescence methods.
AB  - Bioluminescence methods have been applied to the measurement of the viable and total cell masses of small samples of dental plaque. The total adenine nucleotide content of dental plaque samples and of a pure culture of bacteria was determined and the adenylate energy charge calculated from this. When a pure culture of bacteria was killed with heat, the adenylate energy charge decreased exponentially with duration of treatment and corresponded with a decrease in the count of viable organisms.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
