TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL935 impacts colonic metabolism in a simulator of the  human gut microbiota during feeding with red wine polyphenols.
AB  - The colonic microbiota plays an important role in the bioavailibility of dietary  polyphenols. This work has evaluated the impact on the gut microbiota of long-term feeding with both a red wine polyphenolic extract and the flavan-3-ol metabolizer strain Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL935. The study was conducted in the dynamic Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME). The feeding of the gut microbiota model with red wine polyphenols caused an initial decrease in the counts of total bacteria in the ascending colon (AC), with Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium being the most affected bacterial groups. The bacterial counts recovered to initial numbers faster than the overall microbial fermentation and proteolysis, which seemed to be longer affected by polyphenols. Addition of L. plantarum IFPL935 helped to promptly recover total counts, Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae and led to an increase in lactic acid formation in the AC vessel at the start of the polyphenol treatment as well as butyric acid in the transverse (TC) and descending (DC) vessels after 5 days. Moreover, L. plantarum IFPL935 favoured the conversion in the DC vessel of monomeric flavan-3-ols and their intermediate metabolites into phenylpropionic acids and in particular 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. The results open the possibilities of using L. plantarum IFPL935 as a food ingredient for helping individuals showing a low polyphenol-fermenting metabotype to increase their colonic microbial capacities of metabolizing dietary polyphenols.
TI  - Effect of a single oral administration of Lactobacillus plantarum DSMZ 8862/8866  before and at the time point of weaning on intestinal microbial communities in piglets.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a single administration of two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum (DSMZ 8862 and 8866) either before or at the time point of weaning can influence the intestinal microbiota of piglets. A total of 176 piglets were allocated into five groups: control (LP0), administration of 5 x 10(9) or 5x10(10) cfu at day 25 of life (LP1, LP2) and administration of 5 x 10(9) or 5 x 10(10) cfu at day 28 of life (LP3, LP4). Piglets were weaned on day 28 of life. On day 25 (LP1, LP2), 28 (LP0, LP3, LP4), 33 (all groups) and 39 (all groups) of life, 10-13 animals of each group were killed and genomic DNA was extracted from small and large intestinal contents. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that administration of L. plantarum had a significant effect in GIT microbial communities as revealed by the Simpson's index of diversity and cluster analysis based on the Dice similarity index; this effect was more pronounced in groups LP3 and LP4. A treatment dependent presence of Clostridium glycolicum-like, Lactobacillus sobrius-like, Eubacterium rectale-like and Roseburia faecalis-like phylotypes was observed. The results show that the administration of L. plantarum at the point of weaning can influence gastrointestinal microbiota in weaning piglets which may have positive results on gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Intra-individual diversity and similarity of salivary and faecal microbiota.
AB  - In the present study, polyphasic analysis [cultivation, combined with the fingerprinting of individual isolates, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] was applied to study whether similar features concerning the diversity and temporal stability of selected bacterial groups could be detected intra-individually in two different niches - the oral cavity and the colon - from ten adult volunteers consuming probiotics. The predominant bacterial microbiota, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group and bifidobacterial populations, were generally stable in salivary and faecal samples, with the greater diversity seen in faeces. Furthermore, different species predominated at the two different sites. Lactobacillus group DGGE profiles were unstable, yet the intra-individual profiles from faecal and salivary samples collected at the same time resembled each other. The ingested probiotic product did not affect the stability of the bacterial groups studied. The culture-based analysis showed that most subjects harboured identical indigenous Lactobacillus genotypes in saliva and faeces (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum group). Thus, identical indigenous lactobacilli were able to inhabit both ends of the orogastrointestinal tract, whereas the composition of the other bacterial groups studied varied between the two sites.
TI  - In vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  - Synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. However, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition has not been determined. Eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four probiotics, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or Bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h pH-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. The prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. Effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using FISH. Rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. Synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group. Lower levels of Escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10 h of fermentation. Probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. Multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of Lactobacillus-Enterococcus were observed when the probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. Here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
