TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == inhibitors of biofilm formation by biofuel fermentation contaminants.
AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == cost-effective endo-mannanase from bacillus sp. cfr1601 and its application in generation of oligosaccharides from guar gum and as detergent additive.
AB  == the indigenous bacteria bacillus sp. cfr1601 produced significant levels of endo-mannanase when grown on agro-wastes, namely, green gram husk and sunflower oil cake (25.6 iu/ml), used as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. under immobilized cell system, synthetic supports (polyurethane foam, scotch brite, polyester; up to 33.2 iu/ml) were found marginally superior as compared to natural supports (cotton and silk; up to 28.2 iu/ml) for endo-mannanase production. cooperative interactions between l-lysine hcl (0.3% w/v), tween 60 (0.3% v/v), and sunflower oil cake (3.0% w/v) in central composite design response surface methodology ameliorated (1.61-fold) endo-mannanase titers to 48.0 iu/ml. partially purified endo-mannanase was tested for its ability to produce oligosaccharides from guar gum. these oligosaccharides were tested in vitro for their ability to promote growth of lactobacillus plantarum mtcc 5422 and lactobacillus salivarius chs 1e. results indicated that low-molecular-weight  degraded products from guar gum were (1) able to support the growth of tested strains [increased o.d600nm up to 2.3-fold and decrease in ph (<6.3) due to production of short chain fatty acid (scfa)] when used as sole carbon source; and (2) after purification and analysis by electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) were found to be composed of mainly disaccharide and tetrasaccharide. the compatibility of endo-mannanase with various detergents together with wash performance test confirmed its potential applicability for laundry industry.

TI  == isolation and identification of a new intracellular antimicrobial peptide produced by paenibacillus alvei an5.
AB  == a wild-type, gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in malaysia. molecular identification using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus paenibacillus. with 97 % similarity to p. alvei (aug6), the isolate was designated as p. alvei an5. an antimicrobial compound was extracted from p. alvei an5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (pbs), producing an antimicrobial  crude extract (ace). the ace showed antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, escherichia coli atcc 29522, bacillus cereus atcc 14579 and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014. by using sp-sepharose cation exchange chromatography, sephadex g-25 gel filtration and tricine sds-page, the ace was purified, which produced a ~2-kda active band. sds-page and infrared (ir) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in  the ace, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and  de novo sequencing using an automatic, q-tof premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence f-c-k-s-l-p-l-p-l-s-v-k (1,330.7789 da). this novel  peptide was designated as an5-2. the antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from ph 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees c. it also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, sds and edta).

TI  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation carried out in a novel-design stainless steel tank: influence on the dynamics of microbial populations and physical-chemical properties.
AB  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out in a novel-design 40-kg-capacity stainless steel tank (sst) was studied in parallel to traditional brazilian methods of fermentation in wooden boxes (40-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb1) and 600-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb2)) using a multiphasic approach that entailed culture-dependent and -independent microbiological analyses of fermenting cocoa bean pulp samples and target metabolite analyses of both cocoa pulp and cotyledons. both microbiological approaches revealed that the dominant species of major physiological roles were the same for fermentations in sst, relative to boxes. these species consisted of saccharomyces cerevisiae and hanseniaspora sp.  in the yeast group; lactobacillus fermentum and l. plantarum in the lactic acid bacteria (lab) group; acetobacter tropicalis belonging to the acetic acid bacteria (aab) group; and bacillus subtilis in the bacillaceae family. a greater  diversity of bacteria and non-saccharomyces yeasts was observed in box fermentations. additionally, a potentially novel aab belonging to the genus asaia was isolated during fermentation in wb1. cluster analysis of the rrna genes-pcr-dgge profiles revealed a more complex picture of the box samples, indicating that bacterial and yeast ecology were fermentation-specific processes  (wooden boxes vs. sst). the profile of carbohydrate consumption and fermentation  products in the pulp and beans showed similar trends during both fermentation processes. however, the yeast-aab-mediated conversion of carbohydrates into ethanol, and subsequent conversion of ethanol into acetic acid, was achieved with greater efficiency in sst, while temperatures were generally higher during fermentation in wooden boxes. with further refinements, the sst model may be useful in designing novel bioreactors for the optimisation of cocoa fermentation  with starter cultures.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial species diversity of spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out at selected farms in ivory coast and brazil.
AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

TI  == bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in manipur state of india.
AB  == soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of schizostachyum capitatum munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in manipur state of india. in this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rdna sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this acidic starter (ph 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (lab) together. the population distribution of dominant species were bacillus subtilis 29.3%, bacillus cereus 35.7%, bacillus pumilus 2.6%, lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, enterococcus faecium 1.2% and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of b. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region and its-rflp profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in b. subtilis, five subgroups in b. cereus and three subgroups in l. brevis isolates. the most abundant b. subtilis subgroup ib.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during rapd analysis. the molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of bacillus and lab distributed in most of the starter samples. these dominant strains of b. subtilis, l. brevis and l. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.

TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

TI  == chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  == the ethanol production in brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. this work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic  fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. lower mic was found for b. subtilis (10 ppm) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of kamoran(r) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for b. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this kamoran(r) dosage. the growth of  industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than  wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. the main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.

TI  == characterization of an l-arabinose isomerase from the lactobacillus plantarum nc8 strain showing pronounced stability at acidic ph.
AB  == gene araa encoding the l-arabinose isomerase (l-ai) from lactobacillus plantarum  nc8 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encodes a polypeptide of 474 residues having 55% identities with l-ais from bacillus stearothermophilus us100  and thermus sp. im6501. the active form of the purified recombinant l-ai nc8 enzyme is a hexamer composed of six identical 55-kda subunits. the purified enzyme was optimally active at 60 degrees c and ph 7.5. it required divalent cations such as co(2+) and mn(2+) for maximal activity and thermostability. the l-ai nc8 was exceptionally active and stable at acidic ph. indeed, it exhibited 68% of its maximal activity at ph 5.5 and retained 89% of activity after a 24-h incubation at ph 5. the apparent k(m) values of the enzyme for l-arabinose and d-galactose were 43.4 and 69.7 mm, respectively, and its catalytic efficiency was c. 10-fold higher for the physiological substrate l-arabinose (15.5 mm(-1) min(-1)) than d-galactose (1.6 mm(-1) min(-1)). the bioconversion yield of d-galactose to d-tagatose by the purified l-ai nc8 after 6 h at 60 degrees c was  30%.

TI  == exploring the use of natural antimicrobial agents and pulsed electric fields to control spoilage bacteria during a beer production process.
AB  == different natural antimicrobials affected viability of bacterial contaminants isolated at critical steps during a beer production process. in the presence of 1 mg/ml chitosan and 0.3 mg/ml hops, the viability of escherichia coli in an all malt barley extract wort could be reduced to 0.7 and 0.1% respectively after 2 hour- incubation at 4 degrees c. the addition of 0.0002 mg/ml nisin, 0.1 mg/ml chitosan or 0.3 mg/ml hops, selectively inhibited growth of pediococcus sp. in more than 10,000 times with respect to brewing yeast in a mixed culture. in the presence of 0.1 mg ml chitosan in beer, no viable cells of the thermoresistant strain bacillus megaterium were detected. nisin, chitosan and hops increased microbiological stability during storage of a local commercial beer inoculated with lactobacillus plantarum or pediococcus sp. isolated from wort. pulsed electric field (pef) (8 kv/cm, 3 pulses) application enhanced antibacterial activity of nisin and hops but not that of chitosan. the results herein obtained  suggest that the use of these antimicrobial compounds in isolation or in combination with pef would be effective to control bacterial contamination during beer production and storage.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == vector-free cloning of a bacterial endo-1,4-beta-glucanase in lactobacillus plantarum and its effect on the acidifying activity in silage: use of recombinant cellulolytic lactobacillus plantarum as silage inoculant.
AB  == in this research, the advantage of use of cellulolytic recombinant lactobacillus  plantarum as microbial inoculants for alfalfa silage fermentation was evaluated.  to such purpose, two l. plantarum strains, one (l. plantarum lp80) currently commercialised and the other (l. plantarum b41) suitable as silage microbial additive, were genetically modified by integration of cela gene, encoding an alkaline endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from bacillus sp., in the chromosome, by means of a vector-free cloning technique. the heterologous gene was cloned in two fashions: preceded by two promoters (ac1 modification) or in translational coupling with a partial upstream orf (ac2 modification). therefore two different  genetically modified organisms (gmos) per each wild-type (wt), producing 43-59 u/l cellulase in 16 h, were examined. thirty-five micro-ensiling experiments were carried out by inoculating the wt or the derived gmos. l. plantarum b41ac1 cellulolytic clone exhibited significantly increased acidification capacity in silage samples incubated at 37 degrees c. no advantage of use was evident for the other gmos.

TI  == the influence of bacterial inoculants on the microbial ecology of aerobic spoilage of barley silage.
AB  == the aerobic decomposition of barley silage treated with two inoculants (laca and  lacb) containing mixtures of lactobacillus plantarum and enterococcus faecium was investigated over a 28-day period. initially, yeast and bacterial populations were larger in silage inoculated with laca than in silage treated with lacb or water alone (control). differences in the succession of yeasts in silage treated  with laca were observed relative to the other two treatments. from silage treatment with laca, issatchenkia orientalis was the most prevalent yeast taxon over all of the sample times, and the filamentous fungus microascus brevicaulis was also frequently isolated at later sample dates (> or = 14 days). in contrast, saccharomyces exiguus was the most prominent yeast recovered from silage treated  with lacb and water alone on days 2 and 4, although it was supplanted by i. orientalis at later sample times. successional trends of bacteria were similar for all three treatments. lactobacillus spp. were initially the most prevalent bacteria isolated, followed by bacillus spp. (primarily bacillus pumilus). however, the onset of bacillus spp. prominence was faster in laca silage, and klebsiella planticola was frequently recovered at later sample times (> or = 14 days). more filamentous fungi were recovered from laca silage on media containing carboxylmethylcellulose, pectin, or xylan. the most commonly isolated taxa were absidia sp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, byssochlamys nivea, monascus ruber, penicillium brevicompactum, pseudoallescheria boydii, and m. brevicaulis. the results of this study indicated that the two bacterial inoculants incorporated into barley at the time of ensilage affected the microbial ecology of silage decomposition following exposure to air. however, neither of the microbial inoculants effectively delayed aerobic spoilage of barley silage, and the rate of decomposition of silage treated with one of the inoculants (laca) was actually enhanced.

AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

TI  == mode of action of glycine on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the mechanism of glycine action in growth inhibition was studied on eight different species of bacteria of various genera representing the four most common peptidoglycan types. to inhibit the growth of the different organisms to 80%, glycine concentrations from 0.05 to 1.33 m had to be applied. the inhibited cells showed morphological aberrations. it has been demonstrated that glycine is incorporated into the nucleotide-activated peptidoglycan precursors. the amount of incorporated glycine was equivalent to the decrease in the amount of alanine.  with one exception glycine is also incorporated into the peptidoglycan. studies on the primary structure of both the peptidoglycan precursors and the corresponding peptidoglycan have revealed that glycine can replace l-alanine in position 1 and d-alanine residues in positions 4 and 5 of the peptide subunit. replacement of l-alanine in position 1 of the peptide subunit together with an accumulation of uridine diphosphate-muramic acid (udp-murnac), indicating an inhibition of the udp-murnac:l-ala ligase, has been found in three bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus cellobiosus and l. plantarum). however, discrimination against precursors with glycine in position 1 in peptidoglycan synthesis has been observed only in s. aureus. replacement of d-alanine residues  was most common. it occurred in the peptidoglycan with one exception in all strains studied. in corynebacterium sp., c. callunae, l. plantarum, and l. cellobiosus most of the d-alanine replacing glycine occurs c-terminal in position 4, and in c. insidiosum and s. aureus glycine is found c-terminal in position 5.  it is suggested that the modified peptidoglycan precursors are accumulated by being poor substrates for some of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. two mechanisms leading to a more loosely cross-linked peptidoglycan and to morphological changes of the cells are considered. first, the accumulation of glycine-containing precursors may lead to a disrupture of the normal balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis during growth. second, the modified glycine-containing precursors may be incorporated. since these are poor substrates in the transpeptidation reaction, a high percentage of muropeptides remains uncross-linked. the second mechanism may be the more significant in most cases.
