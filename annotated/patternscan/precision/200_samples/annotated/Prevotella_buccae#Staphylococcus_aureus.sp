TI == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
