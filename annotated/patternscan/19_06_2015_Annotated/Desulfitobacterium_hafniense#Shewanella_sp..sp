TI  == application of molecular techniques to evaluate the methanogenic archaea and anaerobic bacteria in the presence of oxygen with different cod:sulfate ratios in a uasb reactor.
AB  == in this paper, the microbial characteristics of the granular sludge in the presence of oxygen (3.0+/-0.7 mg o2 l(-1)) were analyzed using molecular biology  techniques. the granules were provided by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (uasb) operated over 469 days and fed with synthetic substrate. ethanol and sulfate were added to obtain different cod/so4(2-) ratios (3.0, 2.0, and 1.6). the results of fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) analyses showed that archaeal cells, detected by the arc915 probe, accounted for 77%, 84%, and 75% in  the cod/so(4)(2-) ratios (3.0, 2.0, and 1.6, respectively). methanosaeta sp. was  the predominant acetoclastic archaea observed by optical microscopy and fish analyses, and confirmed by sequencing of the excised bands of the dgge gel with a similarity of 96%. the sulfate-reducing bacterium desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (similarity of 99%) was verified by sequencing of the dgge band. others  identified microorganism were similar to shewanella sp. and desulfitobacterium hafniense, with similarities of 95% and 99%, respectively. these results confirmed that the presence of oxygen did not severely affect the metabolism of microorganisms that are commonly considered strictly anaerobic. we obtained mean  efficiencies of organic matter conversion and sulfate reducing higher than 74%.
