TI  == functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the south china sea.
AB  == phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. in this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different  marine sponge species in the south china sea using five different culture media.  eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and  grouped into 13 genera, including actinoalloteichus, kocuria, micrococcus, micromonospora, mycobacterium, nocardiopsis, prauserella, rhodococcus, saccharopolyspora, salinispora, serinicoccus, and streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene. based on the screening of phze genes, ten strains, including five streptomyces, two nocardiopsis, one salinispora, one micrococcus, and one serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. the level of phze gene expression was highly expressed in nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on esi-ms and nmr analysis. the compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against bacillus mycoides sj14, staphylococcus aureus sj51, escherichia coli sj42, and micrococcus luteus sj47. this study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.

TI  == antibiotic oxylipins from alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by lc-ms/ms and nmr spectroscopy. five of the isolated compounds present in a. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus bacillus that were isolated from a. brasiliana. it is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from a. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.

TI  == bacterial constituents of indoor air in a high throughput building in the tropics.
AB  == airborne bacteria are significant biotic constituents of bioaerosol. bacteria at  high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (iaq) and result in many diseases. in tropical environments like malaysia that extensively utilize air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health. currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria on iaq in malaysia. this study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data  on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial malaysia, that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role  played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. it was further necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. before scientists can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study. bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally in the order of 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) per m(3) of air. the most prevalent airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels of the building were gram-positive cocci (67.73%), followed by gram-positive rods (24.26%) and gram-negative rods (7.10%). gram-negative cocci were rarely detected (0.71%). amongst the genera identified, kytococcus sp., micrococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., leifsonia sp., bacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. predominated in indoor air. the most dominant bacterial species were kytococcus sedentarius, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus luteus. the opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a high percentage in the cafeteria. the bacteria isolated in this study have been increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. furthermore, some of them are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects, if any, be investigated further.

TI  == inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of red palm weevil (insecta).
AB  == insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. in this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. we investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. after immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. the antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. ox1, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus). in addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial  peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. the data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial  wall. this study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. however, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == nurses' uniforms: how many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  == this pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. to achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in washington state at the beginning of their shift. worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. the results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. after 48 h, mrsa  positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. additional bacteria identified include: bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus roseus. the significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.

TI  == effect of plant age on endophytic bacterial diversity of balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) root and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  == balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) is widely cultivated vegetable and used  as a remedy for asthma in east asia. experiments were conducted to isolate endophytic bacteria from 1-, 3-, and 6-year-old balloon flower roots and to analyze the enzymatic, antifungal, and anti-human pathogenic activities of the potential endophytic biocontrol agents obtained. total 120 bacterial colonies were isolated from the interior of all balloon flower roots samples. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the population of 'low g +  c gram-positive bacteria' (lgcgpb) gradually increased 60.0-80.0% from 1 to 6 years balloon flower sample. on the other hand, maximum hydrolytic enzyme activity showing endophytic bacteria was under lgcgpb, among the bacterial strains, bacillus sp. (bf1-1 and bf3-8), bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5), and bacillus sp. (bf1-3, bf3-6, and bf6-4) showed maximum enzyme activities. besides, bacillus licheniformis (bf3-5 and bf6-6) and bacillus pumilus (bf6-1) showed maximum antifungal activity against phytophthora capsici, fusarium oxysporum, rhizoctonia solani, and pythium ultimum. moreover, bacillus licheniformis was found in 3 and 6 years balloon flower roots, but bacillus pumilus was found only  in 6 years sample. it is presumed that older balloon flower plants invite more potential antifungal endophytes for there protection from plant diseases. in addition, bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5) showed maximum anti-human pathogenic activity. so, plant age is presumed to influence diversity of balloon flower endophytic bacteria.

TI  == structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  == soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by pseudomonas aeruginosa lbi strain. the chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. the chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. the monorhamnolipid rhac10c1) and the dirhamnolipid rha2c10c10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively,  after 144-h of cultivation. the biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). the rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus and mucor miehei at 64 microg/ml and inhibition of neurospora crassa, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/ml. the results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental  and food industry applications.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from south carolina waters. extraction and assay protocols were  developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of l. virgulata. detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using escherichia coli bl21, vibrio harveyii, micrococcus luteus, and a bacillus sp. isolate. this  represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in l. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western atlantic ocean. results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. reverse-phase hplc, hplc-mass spectrometry, and 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy were  used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions  of l. virgulata. corroborative hplc-ms/nmr evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from l. virgulata, in coral extracts. in subsequent assays, partially-purified l. virgulata fractions collected from hplc-ms fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using m. luteus and v. harveyii. this study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in l. virgulata. we speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.

TI  == the lantibiotic mersacidin is an autoinducing peptide.
AB  == the lantibiotic (lanthionine-containing antibiotic) mersacidin is an antimicrobial peptide consisting of 20 amino acids and is produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728. the structural gene (mrsa) and the genes for producer  self-protection, modification enzymes, transport proteins, and regulator proteins are organized in a 12.3-kb biosynthetic gene cluster on the chromosome of the producer strain. mersacidin is produced in stationary phase in a synthetic medium (k. altena, a. guder, c. cramer, and g. bierbaum, appl. environ. microbiol. 66:2565-2571, 2000). to investigate the influence of the alternative sigma factor h on mersacidin biosynthesis, a sigh knockout was constructed. the knockout mutant was asporogenous, and a comparison to the wild-type strain indicated no significant differences concerning mersacidin production and immunity. characterization of the mrsa promoter showed that the gene is transcribed by the  housekeeping sigma factor a. the biosynthesis of some lantibiotic peptides like nisin or subtilin is regulated in a cell-density-dependent manner (m. kleerebezem, peptides 25:1405-1414, 2004). when mersacidin was added at a concentration of 2 mg/liter to an exponentially growing culture, an earlier production of antibacterial activity against micrococcus luteus atcc 4698 in comparison to that of the control culture was observed, suggesting that mersacidin itself functions as an autoinducer. in real-time pcr experiments, the  expression of mrsa was remarkably increased in the induced culture compared to the control. in conclusion, mersacidin is yet another lantibiotic peptide whose biosynthesis can be regulated by an autoinducing mechanism.

(common cockchafer, coleoptera: scarabaeidae) and the mixtures of these bacterial isolates were investigated on a. solstitiale larvae. crystals from bacillus sp. isolated from m. melolontha were also purified, and tested against the second and third-stage larvae of a. solstitiale. the bacterial isolates of a. solstitiale were identified as pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus, based on their morphology, spore formation, nutritional features, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. the insecticidal effects of the bacterial isolates determined on the larvae of a. solstitiale were 90% with b. cereus isolated from  a. solstitiale, and 75% with b. cereus, b. sphaericus and b. thuringiensis isolated from m. melolontha within ten days. the highest insecticidal effects of  the mixed infections on the larvae of a. solstitiale were 100% both with b. cereus+b. sphaericus and with b. cereus+b. thuringiensis. in the crystal protein  bioassays, the highest insecticidal effect was 65% with crystals of b. thuringiensis and b. sphaericus isolated from m. melolontha within seven days. finally, our results showed that the mixed infections could be utilized as microbial control agents, as they have a 100% insecticidal effect on the larvae of a. solstitiale.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  == mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (s. chatterjee, d. k. chatterjee, r. h. jani, j. blumbach, b. n. ganguli, n. klesel, m. limbert, and g. seibert, j. antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). incubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. biosyntheses of dna, rna, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and d-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. thus, unlike type a lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. the formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. in contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. these data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
