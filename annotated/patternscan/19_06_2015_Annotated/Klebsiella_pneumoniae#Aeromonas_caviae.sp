TI  == occurrence of bacteriophages infecting aeromonas, enterobacter, and klebsiella in water and association with contamination sources in thailand.
AB  == the co-residence of bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts in humans, animals,  and environmental sources directed the use of bacteriophages to track the origins of the pathogenic bacteria that can be found in contaminated water. the objective of this study was to enumerate bacteriophages of aeromonas caviae (aecaks148), enterobacter sp. (enspks513), and klebsiella pneumoniae (klpnks648) in water and  evaluate their association with contamination sources (human vs. animals). bacterial host strains were isolated from untreated wastewater in bangkok, thailand. a double-layer agar technique was used to detect bacteriophages. all three bacteriophages were detected in polluted canal samples, with likely contamination from human wastewater, whereas none was found in non-polluted river samples. aecaks148 was found to be associated with human fecal sources, while enspks513 and klpnks648 seemed to be equally prevalent in both human and animal fecal sources. both bacteriophages were also present in polluted canals that could receive contamination from other fecal sources or the environment. in conclusion, all three bacteriophages were successfully monitored in bangkok, thailand. this study provided an example of bacteriophages for potential use as source identifiers of pathogen contamination. the results from this study will assist in controlling sources of pathogen contamination, especially in developing countries.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == detection, prevalence, purification and characterization of lecithinase of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == lecithinase activity in klebsiella is a rare trait as out of 208 strains of klebsiella belonging to 3 species, viz. k. pneumoniae (168), k. planticola (29) and k. oxytoca (11), only 4 strains of k. pneumoniae produced lecithinase positive colonies on egg-yolk-agar. although cell lysates of 16 k. pneumoniae yielded positive results for lecithinase assay on egg-yolk-agar, 19 strains were  detected positive for lecithinase with elisa using anti-lecithinase serum. release of up to 52.12% cell-bound lecithinase could be achieved with polymyxin-b treatment at 100 micrograms/ml concentration. purified lecithinase was determined to be a high molecular weight (70 kda), crystalizable, anionic (pi, 3.5) protein. it possessed cytolytic, haemolytic and dermonecrotic activities but did not induce fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop or infant mouse guts. it was inactivated by boiling, trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment and alkaline ph. serologically, it was related to lecithinase of aeromonas caviae and phospholipase-c of salmonella.
