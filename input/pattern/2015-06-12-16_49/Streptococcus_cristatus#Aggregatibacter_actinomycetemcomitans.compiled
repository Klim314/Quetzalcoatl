TI  - Interference with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. Interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. METHODS: Cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with Streptococcus sanguinis KTH-4, Streptococcus cristatus CC5A, Streptococcus salivarius TOVE and Streptococcus mitis BMS before Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. Experiments were performed in a modified Robbins-device-type flow cell. Bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The streptococci were able to inhibit A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. Statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial bacteria in periodontal treatment.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. This study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. METHODS: The colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled A. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. Culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a Modified Robbins Device. RESULTS: Colonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis). The most inhibiting species was S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
