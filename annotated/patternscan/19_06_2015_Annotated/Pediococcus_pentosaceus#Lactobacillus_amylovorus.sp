TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria strains and fungal biota for potential use as starter cultures in dry-cured ham.
AB  == during the processing of dry-cured meat products, sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins undergo proteolysis, which has a marked effect on product flavor. microbial proteolytic activity is due to the action of mostly lactic acid bacteria (lab) and to a lesser extent micrococci. the proteolytic capacity of molds in various meat products is of interest to meat processors in the mediterranean area. eleven lab and mold strains from different commercial origins were tested for proteolytic activity against pork myosin, with a view to possible use of these strains as starter cultures for iberian dry-cured ham. proteolytic activity was tested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the lab strains with the highest proteolytic activity were lactobacillus plantarum (l115), pediococcus pentosaceus (saga p tm), and lactobacillus acidophilus (fargo 606 tm). the best fungal candidate was penicillium nalgiovense lem 50i followed by penicillium digitatum, debaryomyces hansenii, and penicillium chrysogenum.

TI  == the combination of mixed lactic acid bacteria and dietary fiber lowers serum cholesterol levels and fecal harmful enzyme activities in rats.
AB  == probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria (lab) and prebiotics such as fiber are generally considered beneficial for health. these affect the microflora composition and fermentation metabolites and consequently contribute to local and systemic effects in humans. the beneficial effects of probiotics can be improved  when combined with prebiotics. here we investigated the effects of a mixed lab supplement combined with dietary fiber on the population of lab in the gut, as well as on serum cholesterol levels, fecal water content and microbial harmful enzyme activities. for animal studies, 0.2 ml of mixed lab (bifidobacterium longum spm1205, lactobacillus acidophilus, and safelac isolated from pediococcus  pentosaceus) supplement (10(7) approximately 10(8) colony forming units per day)  was orally administered to male sprague-dawley rats every day for 2 weeks along with a diet containing 5% or 10% cellulose. the mixed lab supplement combined with dietary cellulose significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum total cholesterol and ldl levels. this combination also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the population of lab and the fecal water content and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced microbial harmful enzyme (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase) activities. these effects of lab were particularly improved by its combination with 5% cellulose compared to the control (a diet without cellulose), and the 5% cellulose combination was more effective than the 10% cellulose combination. in conclusion, the incorporation of a fibrous diet such as cellulose with lactic acid bacteria improved the population of lab, and daily consumption of this combination could reduce the serum cholesterol levels and activities of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, tryptophanase, urease in rats.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == effect of culture conditions on production of butter flavor compounds by pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus acidophilus in semisolid maize-based cultures.
AB  == two series of 120 h mixed cultures of pediococcus pentosaceus mitj-10 and lactobacillus acidophilus hansen 1748 were grown in semisolid maize-based media,  applying an orthogonal factorial design in order to establish the most adequate parameters to get compounds related to butter-like flavor. conditions of maize pre-treatment established in the first series were hot lime-treatment for 20 min, grinding and sieving to 0.0165 in., partial defatting and cooking for 25 min. while the culture conditions established for the second series were the addition  of yeast extract (0.2% w/w), and culture starting with 2x10(6) cfu g(-1) and a ratio of p. pentosaceus and l. acidophilus, 3:1. the fermentation profile was studied in a last culture. lactic acid bacteria (lab) prevailed over the native microorganisms, with a specific growth rate of 0.47 h(-1). diacetyl production correlated (r2=0.9972) with the 12 h exponential growth phase of lab. the concentration of diacetyl at that time was 779.56 mg kg(-1). the contents of lactic acid and volatile fatty acids were low at 12 h, 665 and 1312 mg kg(-1), respectively. during the long stationary phase, they increased up to 4800 and 1886 mg kg(-1), respectively. this procedure might be useful to prepare naturally aromatized raw materials for the food industry.

TI  == use of hydrolysates from atlantic cod (gadus morhua l.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sakei and pediococcus pentosaceus. comparative studies with mrs-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == genotypic analyses of lactobacilli with a range of tannase activities isolated from human feces and fermented foods.
AB  == a total of 77 tannase producing lactobacilli strains isolated from human feces or fermented foods were examined for their genotypic profiles and intensities of tannase production. with a pcr-based assay targeting reca gene, all strains except one isolate were assigned to either lactobacillus plantarum, l. paraplantarum, or l. pentosus whereas a 16/23s rdna targeted pcr-based assay identified all except 6 isolates (inclusive of the above one isolate) as one of the closely related species. subsequent dna/dna hybridization assays revealed that these 6 exceptional isolates showed low homology (between 1.2% and 55.8% relative dna binding) against type strains of the three species. supplemental carbohydrate fermentation profiles on the 6 isolates indicated that two of them were identified as l. acidophilus, one as pediococcus acidilactici, one as p. pentosaceus, and two remained unidentifiable. the evidence suggests that the 16/23s rdna targeted pcr assay can be used as a reliable identification tool for  the closely related lactobacilli, and that the tannase gene is widely distributed within members of the lactobacillaceae family. meanwhile, a randomly amplified polymorphism dna (rapd) analysis revealed that all except 8 isolates were well allocated in 4 major rapd clusters, though not species specific, consisting of two l. plantarum predominant clusters, one l. paraplantarum predominant, and one  l. pentosus predominant. the rapd patterns of the 8 non-clustered isolates, which consisted of the 6 unidentifiable isolates and 2 isolates identified as l. pentosus, were <40% similarity to those belonging to the 4 clusters. a quantitative assay of the tannase activities showed that there was a marked variation in the activities among the strains, which did not correlate with either species identification or clustering by rapd.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == effect of some nutritional and environmental parameters on the production of diacetyl and on starch consumption by pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus acidophilus in submerged cultures.
AB  == three series of 5-day submerged cultures with pediococcus pentosaceus mitj-10 and lactobacillus acidophilus hansen 1748 were carried out in starch-based media, and the effect of cultural factors on the changes of starch, diacetyl and amylase activity determined. in axenic cultures, ped. pentosaceus mitj-10 produced more diacetyl (63.27 mg l(-1)) by adding glucose, yeast extract and caco3 (p < 0.01),  at 28 degrees c (p < 0.05); but more starch was consumed (18.4 g l(-1)) in the absence of glucose (p < 0.01). lact. acidophilus hansen 1748 consumed more starch (26.56 g l(-1)) at 28 degrees c, with caco3, glucose (p < 0.01) and yeast extract (p < 0.05); however, the amylolytic activity (10077u l(-1)) was favoured at 35 degrees c (p < 0.01). little starch was consumed in mixed cultures due to the low ph; nevertheless, diacetyl content rose to 135.76 mg l(-1) at 32 degrees c (p < 0.01). therefore, both studied strains might be useful to produce aromatic extensors from starchy substrates. these natural aromatic extensors are of interest to the food industry.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  == in order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. two of these lactobacillus casei crl 431 and l. acidophilus crl 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (bio milk), which is believed to be beneficial for health. the other strains, lactococcus lactis crl 526, pediococcus pentosaceus crl 923 and propionibacterium acidipropionici crl 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. a method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. four of the studied strains, l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. lactis and p. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. l. casei, l. acidophilus, p. pentosaceus and l. lactis contained a4 alpha type murein, while p. acidipropionici contained a3 gamma type. the capacity of orally  administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. only the pg of l. casei showed this activity. no differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study the effects of both ph and organic acids on helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 were tested. lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. casei, lact. bulgaricus, pediococcus pentosaceus and bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, ph and inhibition of h. pylori growth. a standard antimicrobial  plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of h. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. this inhibition was due both to the ph of the solution and its concentration. six strains of lact. acidophilus and one strain of lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited h. pylori growth where as bifidobacterium bifidus, ped. pentosaceus and lact. bulgaricus did not. concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with h. pylori inhibition. the role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of h. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.
