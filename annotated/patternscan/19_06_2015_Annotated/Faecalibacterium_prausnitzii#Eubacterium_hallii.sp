TI  == essential oils have different effects on human pathogenic and commensal bacteria  in mixed faecal fermentations compared with pure cultures.
AB  == a static batch culture system inoculated with human faeces was used to determine  the influence of essential oil compounds (eocs) on mixed faecal microbiota. bacteria were quantified using quantitative pcr of 16s rrna genes. incubation for 24 h of diluted faeces from six individuals caused enrichment of bifidobacterium  spp., but proportions of other major groups were unaffected. thymol and geraniol  at 500 p.p.m. suppressed total bacteria, resulting in minimal fermentation. thymol at 100 p.p.m. had no effect, nor did eugenol or nerolidol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. except for a slight suppression of eubacterium hallii. methyl isoeugenol at 100 or 500 p.p.m. suppressed the growth of total bacteria, accompanied by a large fall in the molar proportion of propionate formed. the relative abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii was unaffected except with thymol at 500 p.p.m. the ability of eocs to control numbers of the pathogen clostridium difficile was  investigated in a separate experiment, in which the faecal suspensions were amended by the addition of pure culture of c. difficile. numbers of c. difficile  were suppressed by thymol and methyl isoeugenol at 500 p.p.m. and to a lesser extent at 100 p.p.m. eugenol and geraniol gave rather similar suppression of c. difficile numbers at both 100 and 500 p.p.m. nerolidol had no significant effect. it was concluded from these and previous pure-culture experiments that thymol and geraniol at around 100 p.p.m. could be effective in suppressing pathogens in the  small intestine, with no concern for beneficial commensal colonic bacteria in the distal gut.

TI  == starch structure modulates metabolic activity and gut microbiota profile.
AB  == normal maize starch and high amylose maize starch (has) either in native or thermally treated forms were used to investigate the effect of starch structure on the production of metabolites and gut microbiota profile using an anaerobic in vitro system. the changes in starch structure during fermentation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (sem), high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ftir). the native normal starch showed a porous structure during fermentation, indicating it was quickly metabolized by gut bacteria, whereas the has showed a smooth structure, suggesting it was utilized gradually. hplc chromatography showed that  amylose fraction with low molecular weight (mw) had a higher resistance to be fermented by gut bacteria than other starch molecular fractions. thermal treatment enhanced starch fermentation kinetics, especially for amylopectin and high mw amylose fractions. ftir analysis suggests that the structure of the normal starch, either in native or thermally treated, was less organized compared to has, and this structural character led to the normal starch to be utilized more quickly by gut bacteria with a faster increase in the ir ratio 1047/1022 cm(-1) (p < 0.01) during fermentation. the measurement of metabolic activity indicates that the normal starch with a less organized structure was utilized faster and generated more acetate and lactate during fermentation; has with a highly organized structure was more likely to produce butyrate, corresponding the significant increase (p < 0.001) in the populations of butyrate-producing strains (faecalibacterium prausnitzii and eubacterium hallii) in the cultures. this study reveals that fermentation kinetics of starch substrate is one of important characteristics for manipulating gut microbiota fermentation behaviours.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to roseburia intestinalis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium  hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. bacteria related to e. hallii and the genera roseburia and faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
