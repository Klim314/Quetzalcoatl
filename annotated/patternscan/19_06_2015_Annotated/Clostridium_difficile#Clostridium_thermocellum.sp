TI  == the correlation between clostridium-difficile infection and human gut concentrations of bacteroidetes phylum and clostridial species.
AB  == we aimed to assess differences in bacterial intensities of bacteroidetes phylum and different clostridial species in the human intestines with respect to c. difficile infection. patients with a stool assay for c. difficile toxin were identified via the microbiology laboratory in our institute. bacterial populations were quantified from stool samples of four groups of patients: group  i-patients with c. difficile associated diarrhea (cdad); group ii-asymptomatic c. difficile carriers; group iii-patients with non-c. difficile diarrhea; group iv-patients with no diarrhea and negative stool samples for the c. difficile toxin (control group). stool was examined for three genes-c. difficile toxin a gene, 16s rrna gene from clostridium thermocellum representing other clostridial  species, and 16s rrna gene from bacteroides fragilis representing the bacteroidetes phylum. fifty-nine patients underwent analysis of the stool (cdad group 14, carriers group 14, non-c. difficile diarrhea group 16, control group 15). c. difficile concentration was highest in the cdad group, followed by the carriers group. higher concentrations of both clostridial species and bacteriodetes were observed in the control and non-c. difficile diarrhea groups compared to the cdad and carriers groups. we demonstrated an inverse association  between infection with c. difficile and the abundance of bacteroidetes phylum and other clostridial species in human intestines. studies with larger samples and broader diagnostic procedures are needed in order to better explore and understand this association.

TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == high activity of inclusion bodies formed in escherichia coli overproducing clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d.
AB  == the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by escherichia coli overproducing clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d (egd) was investigated. egd was found in inclusion bodies as a 68 kda form, whereas the size of the cytoplasmic form was 65 kda. upon solubilization with urea followed by dialysis, the 68 kda form was converted to the 65 kda species. proteolysis occurred within the cooh-terminal, reiterated region of the 68 kda form, which is conserved among most c. thermocellum endoglucanases, but is not required for catalytic activity. the specific activity of the enzyme embedded in inclusion bodies was close to that of the purified protein. thus, inclusion body formation does not involve denaturation of the catalytic domain of egd, but, more likely, the participation  of the reiterated, conserved region in intermolecular interactions.
