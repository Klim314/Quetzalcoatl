TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == a differential medium for lactic acid-producing bacteria in a mixed culture.
AB  == aims: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue (mmrs-bpb) was tested as a medium for counting and differentiation of each lactic acid-producing bacterium (lab), especially in a mixed culture. methods and results: type strains of 10 lab species (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis, l. bulgaricus, l. gasseri, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. reuteri, weissella confusa, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. infantis) and five commercial yogurts were inoculated on plate count agar with bromocresol purple, mmrs, and mmrs-bpb.  each type strain showed more clearly formed colonies on the three media under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. especially each type strain produced colonies with specific characteristics of each species on mmrs-bpb. commercial yogurts produced the largest number of colonies with various shapes and colours on mmrs-bpb. conclusions: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue under anaerobic conditions is appropriate for counting and differentiating each lab in a mixed culture. significance and impact of the study: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue will  be useful in isolation and enumeration of each lab from fermented foods as well as intestinal microflora.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).
