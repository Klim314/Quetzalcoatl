TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == bone and joint infections due to anaerobic bacteria: an analysis of 61 cases and  review of the literature.
AB  == the diagnosis of anaerobic bone and joint infections (bji) were underestimated before the advent of molecular identification and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). we report  61 cases of anaerobic infections based on our 4-year experience with the management of bji. a total of 75% of cases were post-surgical infections, associated with osteosynthesis devices (65%). early infections occurred in 27% of cases, delayed infections in 17.5% of cases, and late infections in 55% of cases. we recorded 36 species of 93 anaerobic strains using maldi-tof ms (91) and molecular methods (2). we identified 20 strains of propionibacterium acnes, 13 of finegoldia magna, six of peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, and six of p. harei. polymicrobial infections occurred in 50 cases. surgical treatment was performed in 93.5% of cases. the antibiotic treatments included amoxicillin (30%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (16%), metronidazole (30%), and clindamycin (26%). hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used in 17 cases (28%). the relapse rate (27%) was  associated with lower limbs localization (p = 0.001). p. acnes bji was associated with shoulder (p = 0.019), vertebra (p = 0.021), and head flap localization (p =  0.011), and none of these cases relapsed (p = 0.007). f. magna bji was associated with ankle localization (p = 0.014). anaerobic bji is typically considered as a post-surgical polymicrobial infection, and the management of this infection combines surgical and medical treatments. maldi-tof ms and molecular identification have improved diagnosis. thus, physicians should be aware of the polymicrobial nature of anaerobic bji to establish immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment during the post-surgical period until accurate microbiological results have been obtained.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically relevant gram-positive anaerobic cocci collected over a three-year period in the netherlands.
AB  == the susceptibility of 14 species of 115 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) was  determined for 14 antibiotics. to assure correct identification, strains were genotypically identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequencing. susceptibility differences (mic(5)(0) and mic(9)(0)) for penicillin g, clindamycin, tigecycline, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ertapenem, meropenem, metronidazole, and doxycycline were found for the three clinically most relevant gpac species: finegoldia magna, parvimonas micra, and peptoniphilus harei.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus by multiplex pcr assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
