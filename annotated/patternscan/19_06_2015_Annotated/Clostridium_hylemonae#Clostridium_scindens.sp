TI  == diversity of intestinal clostridium coccoides group in the japanese population, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == we used sensitive rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr)  to quantify the clostridium coccoides group, which is a major anaerobic population in the human intestine. for this purpose, the c. coccoides group was classified into 3 subgroups and 19 species for expediency in accordance with the  existing database, and specific primers were newly developed to evaluate them. population levels of the c. coccoides group in human feces determined by rt-qpcr  were equivalent to those determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 96 volunteers (32 young children, 32 adults and 32 elderly) by using the 22 new primer sets together with the c. coccoides group-specific primer setm revealed that (i) total counts obtained as the sum of the 3 subgroups and 19 species were equivalent to the results obtained by using the c. coccoides group-specific primer set; (ii) total c. coccoides-group counts in the elderly were significantly lower than those in young children and adults; (iii) genus blautia was the most common subgroup in the human intestinal c. coccoides-group populations at all age populations tested; (iv) the prevalences of fusicatenibacter saccharivorans and genus dorea were significantly higher in adults than in young children and the elderly; and (v) the prevalences of c. scindens and c. hylemonae, both of which produce secondary bile acid in the human intestine, were significantly higher in the elderly than in young children and adults. hierarchical clustering and principal  component analysis showed clear separation of the bacterial components between adult and elderly populations. taken together, these data suggest that aging plays an important role in the diversity of c. coccoides-group populations in human intestinal microbiota; changes in this diversity likely influence the health of the host.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a bile acid inducible 7alpha-dehydroxylating operon in clostridium hylemonae tn271.
AB  == primary bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, conjugated to either glycine or taurine and secreted into bile. bile salts undergo enterohepatic circulation several times each day. during this process, they are biotransformed into a variety of metabolites by gut bacteria. the major biotransformation is the 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid yielding deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively. 7alpha-dehydroxylation is a multi-step pathway. the genes encoding  enzymes in this pathway have been identified in two species of "high" activity strains of clostridia. here, we report the isolation and characterization of a bile acid inducible (bai) operon in clostridium hylemonae, a "low" activity 7alpha-dehydroxylating strain. the gene organization and sequence of the baibcdefghi operon was highly conserved between c. hylemonae and "high" activity  strains. surprisingly, the baia gene was missing from the bai operon of c. hylemonae. the baia gene was isolated using pcr and degenerate oligonucleotide primers. the mrna start site for the large bai operon was determined and shown to be only 11bp from the initiation codon of the first gene. it was also discovered  that allocholic acid (5alpha) induced the bai operon and stimulated the conversion of [24-(14)c] cholic acid to [24-(14)c] allodeoxycholic acid in cultures of c. scindens and c. hylemonae allodeoxycholic acid. finally, it was discovered that the addition of testosterone to the growth medium markedly increased 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid in clostridium scindens and c. hylemonae. we hypothesize that testosterone may be a gratuitous inducer of genes  involved in the reductive arm of the bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation pathway.

TI  == assignment of eubacterium sp. vpi 12708 and related strains with high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity to clostridium scindens and proposal of clostridium hylemonae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == unknown eubacterium-like organisms vpi 12708 and five strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) had high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity; the unknown clostridium-like organisms tn-271t and tn-272 also had the same activity. analysis of their 16s rdna sequences demonstrated that all strains belong to cluster xiva of the genus clostridium (collins et al., 1994). strain vpi 12708 and five other strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) formed a single cluster and strains tn-271t and tn-272 formed another single cluster. clostridium scindens jcm 6567t was the most closely related species for two clusters in the phylogenetic tree. values for dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain vpi 12708 and the other five strains were greater than 70%, showing that these micro-organisms were a single species. therefore, we identified strain vpi  12708 and the five other strains as c. scindens. in addition, dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain tn-271t and strain n-272 revealed that strains tn-271t and tn-272 were distinct from c. scindens jcm 6567t. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and dna-dna similarity data, it was  concluded that strains tn-271t and tn-272 are members of a new species of the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium hylemonae is proposed. the type strain is strain tn-271t (= jcm 10539t).
