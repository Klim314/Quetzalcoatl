TI  == culture-independent evaluation of the appendix and rectum microbiomes in children with and without appendicitis.
AB  == purpose: the function of the appendix is largely unknown, but its microbiota likely contributes to function. alterations in microbiota may contribute to appendicitis, but conventional culture studies have not yielded conclusive information. we conducted a pilot, culture-independent 16s rrna-based microbiota  study of paired appendix and rectal samples. methods: we collected appendix and rectal swabs from 21 children undergoing appendectomy, six with normal appendices and fifteen with appendicitis (nine perforated). after dna extraction, we amplified and sequenced 16s rrna genes and analyzed sequences using clovr. we identified organisms differing in relative abundance using anova (p<0.05) by location (appendix vs. rectum), disease (appendicitis vs. normal), and disease severity (perforated vs. non-perforated). results: we identified 290 taxa in the  study's samples. three taxa were significantly increased in normal appendices vs. normal rectal samples: fusibacter (p = 0.009), selenomonas (p = 0.026), and peptostreptococcus (p = 0.049). five taxa were increased in abundance in normal vs. diseased appendices: paenibacillaceae (p = 0.005), acidobacteriaceae gp4 (p = 0.019), pseudonocardinae (p = 0.019), bergeyella (p = 0.019) and rhizobium (p = 0.045). twelve taxa were increased in the appendices of appendicitis patients vs. normal appendix: peptostreptococcus (p = 0.0003), bilophila (p = 0.0004), bulleidia (p = 0.012), fusobacterium (p = 0.018), parvimonas (p = 0.003), mogibacterium (p = 0.012), aminobacterium (p = 0.019), proteus (p = 0.028), actinomycineae (p = 0.028), anaerovorax (p = 0.041), anaerofilum (p = 0.045), porphyromonas (p = 0.010). five taxa were increased in appendices in patients with perforated vs. nonperforated appendicitis: bulleidia (p = 0.004), fusibacter (p = 0.005), prevotella (p = 0.021), porphyromonas (p = 0.030), dialister (p = 0.035). three taxa were increased in rectum samples of patients with appendicitis compared to the normal patients: bulleidia (p = 0.034), dialister (p = 0.003), and porphyromonas (p = 0.026). conclusion: specific taxa are more abundant in normal appendices compared to the rectum, suggesting that a distinctive appendix  microbiota exists. taxa with altered abundance in diseased and severely diseased  (perforated) samples may contribute to appendicitis pathogenesis, and may provide microbial signatures in the rectum useful for guiding both treatment and diagnosis of appendicitis.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
