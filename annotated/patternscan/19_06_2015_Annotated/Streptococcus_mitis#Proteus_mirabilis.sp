TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.
