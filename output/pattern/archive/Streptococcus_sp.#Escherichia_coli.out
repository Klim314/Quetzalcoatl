genome-wide mapping of cystitis due to streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli in mice identifies a unique bladder transcriptome that signifies pathogen-specific antimicrobial defense against urinary tract infection.
the most common causes of urinary tract infections (utis) are gram-negative pathogens such as escherichia coli; however, gram-positive organisms, including streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), also cause uti. in gbs infection, uti progresses to cystitis once the bacteria colonize the bladder, but the host responses triggered in the bladder immediately following infection are largely unknown. here, we used genome-wide expression profiling to map the bladder transcriptome of gbs uti in mice infected transurethrally with uropathogenic gbs that was cultured from a 35-year-old women with cystitis. rna from bladders was applied to affymetrix gene-1.0st microarrays; quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (qrt-pcr) was used to analyze selected gene responses identified in array data sets. a surprisingly small significant-gene list of 172 genes was identified at 24 h; this compared to 2,507 genes identified in a side-by-side comparison with uropathogenic e. coli (upec). no genes exhibited significantly altered expression at 2 h in gbs-infected mice according to arrays despite high bladder bacterial loads at this early time point. the absence of a marked early host response to gbs juxtaposed with broad-based bladder responses activated by upec at 2 h. bioinformatics analyses, including integrative system-level network mapping, revealed multiple activated biological pathways in the gbs bladder transcriptome that regulate leukocyte activation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cytokine-chemokine biosynthesis. these findings define a novel, minimalistic type of bladder host response triggered by gbs uti, which comprises collective antimicrobial pathways that differ dramatically from those activated by upec. overall, this study emphasizes the unique nature of bladder immune activation mechanisms triggered by distinct uropathogens.
an escherichia coli cell membrane chromatography-offline lc-tof-ms method for screening and identifying antimicrobial peptides from jatropha curcas meal protein isolate hydrolysates.
a novel, simple, and rapid method, named cell membrane affinity extraction (cmae)-offline liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (lc-tof-ms) was developed for screening and identifying antimicrobial peptides from jatropha curcas meal protein isolate hydrolysates (jcmpih) obtained by proteolytic enzyme (pepsin, trypsin, protamex, neutrase, flavourzyme, papain, alcalase, and acid protease) hydrolysis. a cationic antimicrobial peptide (cailthkr, jcpep8) was successfully isolated and identified by this method. antimicrobial assay indicated that jcpep8 was active against the tested microorganisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, shigella dysenteriae atcc 51302, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27553, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus subtilis atcc 23631, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619) with minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 29 to 68 microg/ml. jcpep8 induced significant morphological alterations of the tested microbe surfaces, as shown by transmission electron microscopy, indicating strong membrane disruption. the results showed that cmae-offline lc-tof-ms could be a promising method for discovering high-throughput screening antimicrobial peptides from jcmpih.
characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.
heterologous expression ofa histone-like protein from streptococcus intermedius in escherichia coli alters the nucleoid structure and inhibits the growth of e. coli.
escherichia coli failed to survive after transformation with a streptococcus intermedius histone-like protein gene (si-hlp) and its promoter-harbored plasmid. the promoter function of si-hlp in e. coli was determined using enhanced green fluorescence protein (egfp) gene as a reporter. the inhibitory effect of si-hlp on e. coli viability was verified by a tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. further study suggested that si-hlp may alter the bacterial nucleoid structure, leading to the growth inhibition of e. coli.
inhibition of p-fimbriated escherichia coli adhesion by multivalent galabiose derivatives studied by a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance.
objectives: uropathogenic p-fimbriated escherichia coli adheres to host cells by  specific adhesins recognizing galabiose (galalpha1-4gal)-containing structures on cell surfaces. in search of agents inhibiting this first step of infection, the inhibition potency of a set of synthetic mono- and multivalent galabiose compounds was evaluated. in order to mimic the flow conditions of natural infections, a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance (spr) was established. methods and results: for the measurement of the binding of e. coli to a surface containing galabiose, live bacteria were injected over the flow cell, and the inhibition of adhesion caused by the galabiose inhibitors was recorded. quantitative binding data were recorded in real-time for each inhibitor. the results were compared with those of conventional static haemagglutination and elisa-based cell adhesion assays. compared with the gram-positive streptococcus suis bacteria, which also bind to galabiose and whose binding inhibition is strongly dependent on the multivalency of the inhibitor, e. coli inhibition was only moderately affected by the valency. however, a novel octavalent compound was found to be the most effective inhibitor of e. coli papg(j96) adhesion, with an ic50 value of 2 microm. conclusions: measurement of bacterial adhesion by spr is an efficient way to characterize the adhesion of whole bacterial cells and allows the characterization of the inhibitory potency of adhesion inhibitors under dynamic flow conditions. under these conditions, multivalency increases the anti-adhesion potency of galabiose-based inhibitors of p-fimbriated e. coli adhesion and provides a promising approach for the design of high-affinity anti-adhesion agents.
intestinal microflora in 45 crows in ueno zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (corvus macrorhynchos) captured from july to  december 2002 at ueno zoo, tokyo were identified as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas maltophila, staphylococcus spp., micrococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. e. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). in an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of e. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin g, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were o8, o114 and o144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.

neonatal early onset escherichia coli sepsis: trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis.
background: although intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis has lowered the incidence of early onset group b streptococcus (gbs) sepsis, there are concerns that the increased use of antibiotics may raise the incidence of non-gbs antimicrobial-resistant infections. the objective of this study was to determine trends in the incidence and antimicrobial resistance of early onset sepsis caused by escherichia coli in the era of antimicrobial prophylaxis. methods: all neonates with early onset e. coli infection who were born at la paz hospital, madrid, from january 1, 1992, through december 31, 2002, were identified from a microbiologic register of all neonatal infections. to evaluate the effect of the guidelines for gbs prevention, data were pooled and compared for: 1992 through 1995 (period 1); 1996 through 1998 (period 2); and 1999 through 2002 (period 3). results: early onset e. coli infection was diagnosed in 41 of 84 612 live births. the infection rate did not change significantly during the 3 time periods (0.56, 0.24 and 0.55 per 1000 during periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively; p = 0.936, linear-by-linear association). the proportion of e. coli infections that were resistant to ampicillin increased significantly among preterm infants, from 25% (1 of 4) in period 1, to 100% (2 of 2) in period 2 and to 91% (10 of 11) in period 3 (p = 0.017, linear-by-linear association), but not among term infants, with 67% (8 of 12) in period 1, 50% (1 of 2) in period 2 and 44% (4 of 5) in period 3 (p = 0.317, linear-by-linear association). conclusions: although the incidence of early onset sepsis caused by e. coli remained stable during the study period, antibiotic-resistant e. coli infections increased among preterm infants. on the whole these trends are reassuring with respect to gbs prophylaxis. however, the increase in the proportion of ampicillin-resistant infections in preterm infants suggests that continuing evaluation of the risks and benefits of prophylaxis in this group is critical.
inhibition of small intestinal colonization of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli by streptococcus faecium m74 in pigs.
colonizing and anti e. coli activity of s. faecium m74 was tested by oral inoculation of cesarean derived, colostrum deprived piglets with streptococcus faecium m74 and subsequently with a heat stable enterotoxin (st) producing e. coli (o101 : k30 : k99 : nm). enterotoxin neutralization and co-culture studies were also performed in vitro. bacterial counts in 10 cm ileal segments, fluorescein antibody stained cryostat sections, as well as 0.5 micron sections from the ilea of the experimental pigs taken 16 hours post exposure to enterotoxic e. coli (etec) all indicated that s. faecium m74 could not colonize the ileum of the newborn pigs, in a single high (7 x 10(8) - 3 x 10(10)) dose either in tsb or in milk suspension, in contrast to the etec. however, s. faecium given in milk suspension resulted a marked decrease in ileal colonization of etec and in weight loss of piglets. in vitro experiments indicated that neither extracellular nor cell-bound products of s. faecium m74 could neutralise st, but there was a significant reduction of ph in the tsb cultures of s. faecium that was accompanied by a reduction in etec counts of the mixed cultures.
