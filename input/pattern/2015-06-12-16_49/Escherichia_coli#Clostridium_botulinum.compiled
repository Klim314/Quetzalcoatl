TI  - Microbiological and physicochemical analysis of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey for assessing quality standards and commercialization.
AB  - Due to the interest in the production and trading of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey in the province of Misiones, Argentina, in this work we assessed microbiological and physicochemical parameters in order to contribute to the elaboration of standards for quality control and promote commercialization. Results showed that yatei honey samples had significantly different microbiological and physicochemical characteristics in comparison to established quality standards for Apis mellifera honey. Thus, we observed that values for pH (3.72), glucose (19.01 g/100g) and fructose (23.74 g/100g) were lower than A. mellifera quality standards, while acidity (79.42 meq/kg), moisture (24%), and mould and yeast count (MY) (3.02 log CFU/g) were higher. The acid content was correlated with glucose (R2=0.75) and fructose (R2=0.68) content, and also with mould and yeast counts (R2=0.45) to a lesser extent. The incidence of microorganisms in yatei honey samples reached 42.85% and 39% for Clostridium sulfite-reducers and Bacillus spp., respectively. No C. botulinum or B. cereus cells were detected. Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. incidence was similar (ca. 7.14%), whereas Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. were not detected. We conclude that the microbiological and physicochemical properties of yatei honey are different from those of A. mellifera honey; hence, different quality standards could be implemented to promote its commercialization.
TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Holotoxin Activity of Botulinum Neurotoxin Subtype A4 Originating from a Nontoxigenic Clostridium botulinum Expression System.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum subtype A4 neurotoxin (BoNT/A4) is naturally expressed in the dual-toxin-producing C. botulinum strain 657Ba at 100x lower titers than BoNT/B. In this study, we describe purification of recombinant BoNT/A4 (rBoNT/A4) expressed in a nonsporulating and nontoxigenic C. botulinum expression host strain. The rBoNT/A4 copurified with nontoxic toxin complex components provided in trans by the expression host and was proteolytically cleaved to the active dichain form. Activity of the recombinant BoNT/A4 in mice and in human neuronal cells was about 1,000-fold lower than that of BoNT/A1, and the recombinant BoNT/A4 was effectively neutralized by botulism heptavalent antitoxin. A previous report using recombinant truncated BoNT/A4 light chain (LC) expressed in Escherichia coli has indicated reduced stability and activity of BoNT/A4 LC compared to BoNT/A1 LC, which was surmounted by introduction of a single-amino-acid substitution, I264R. In order to determine whether this mutation would also affect the holotoxin activity of BoNT/A4, a recombinant full-length BoNT/A4 carrying this mutation as well as a second mutation predicted to increase solubility (L260F) was produced in the clostridial expression system. Comparative analyses of the in vitro, cellular, and in vivo activities of rBoNT/A4 and rBoNT/A4-L260F I264R showed 1,000-fold-lower activity than BoNT/A1 in both the mutated and nonmutated BoNT/A4. This indicates that these mutations do not alter the activity of BoNT/A4 holotoxin. In summary, a recombinant BoNT from a dual-toxin-producing strain was expressed and purified in an endogenous clostridial expression system, allowing analysis of this toxin.
TI  - Production of recombinant botulism antigens: a review of expression systems.
AB  - Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by intoxication with neurotoxins produced  by Clostridium botulinum. Despite their similar mechanism of action, the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are classified in eight serotypes (A to H). As to veterinary medicine, the impact of this disease is essentially economic, since different species of production animals can be affected, especially by BoNT/C and D. In human health, botulism is feared in a possible biological warfare, what would involve mainly the BoNT/A, B, E and F. In both cases, the most effective way to deal with botulism is through prevention, which involves vaccination. However, the current vaccines against this disease have several drawbacks on their process of production and, besides this, can be dangerous to producers since it requires certain level of biosafety. This way, recombinant vaccines have been shown to be a great alternative for the development of vaccines against both animal and human botulism. All BoNTs have a 50-kDa light chain (LC) and a 100-kDa heavy chain (HC). The latter one presents two domains of 50 kDa, called the N-terminal (HN) and C-terminal (HC) halves. Among these regions, the HC alone seem to confer the proper immune response against intoxication. Since innumerous studies describe the expression of these distinct regions using different systems, strategies, and protocols, it is difficult to define the best option for a viable vaccine production. Thereby, the present review describes the problematic of botulism and discusses the main advances for the viable production of vaccines for both human and veterinary medicine using recombinant antigens.
TI  - Neuroprotective effects of C3 exoenzyme in excitotoxic retinopathy.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of C3 exoenzyme (C3) on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced retinopathy in rats. C3 was expressed in Escherichia. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Immunofluorescence was performed in NIH 3T3 cells treated with C3 to verify the cellular uptake of the protein. NMDA was injected intravitreally into rat eyes with or without C3. At various time points after injection, eyes were enucleated. Hematoxylin/eosin staining was performed on retina cross-sections for morphological analysis. Survival and apoptosis of cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) were assessed by cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) on retina flat-mounts. RhoA levels in retina cells were evaluated by Western blot to detect C3 uptake in vivo. The cellular uptake of C3 was verified by immunofluorescence. Damage including a decrease in inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness and reduction of cell density in the GCL, corresponding to apoptosis of neurons, was induced by intravitreal injection of NMDA. Protection against this damage was observed following co-injection of C3 and NMDA. RhoA ADP-ribosylation induced by C3 was confirmed by Western blot. Our results suggest that C3 exerts neuroprotective effects against excitotoxic damage induced by NMDA.
TI  - Eutrophication and bacterial pathogens as risk factors for avian botulism outbreaks in wetlands receiving effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants.
AB  - Due to the scarcity of water resources in the "Mancha Humeda" Biosphere Reserve,  the use of treated wastewater has been proposed as a solution for the conservation of natural threatened floodplain wetlands. In addition, wastewater treatment plants of many villages pour their effluent into nearby natural lakes. We hypothesized that certain avian pathogens present in wastewater may cause avian mortalities which would trigger avian botulism outbreaks. With the aim of testing our hypothesis, 24 locations distributed in three wetlands, two that receive wastewater effluents and one serving as a control, were monitored during a year. Sediment, water, water bird feces, and invertebrates were collected for the detection of putative avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens type A, and Clostridium botulinum type C/D. Also, water and sediment physicochemical properties were determined. Overall, APEC, C. perfringens, and C. botulinum were significantly more prevalent in samples belonging to the wetlands which receive wastewater. The occurrence of a botulism outbreak in one of the studied wetlands coincided with high water temperatures and sediment 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), a decrease in water redox potential, chlorophyll a, and sulfate levels, and an increase in water inorganic carbon levels. The presence of C. botulinum in bird feces before the onset of the outbreak indicates that carrier birds exist and highlights the risk of botulinum toxin production in their carcasses if they die by other causes such as bacterial diseases, which are more probable in wastewater wetlands.
TI  - [Bacterial infections, what we can learn from each outbreak].
AB  - Studies on outbreaks or incidences of infectious diseases and food poisonings are the starting points in research. Analyses of the outbreaks will provide the mechanism by which the illnesses occur and the establishment of countermeasure. We report here some sensational outbreaks which recently occurred in Japan: 1) enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157 outbreaks by pickled Chinese cabbage in Hokkaido, 2) EHEC O157/O111 outbreaks by raw beef in Toyama Prefecture, 3) parasitic food poisoning due to raw olive flounder consumption in the western Japan, and 4) botulism due to the consumption of vacuum packed food in Tottori Prefecture.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of a novel haemagglutinin component of the toxin complex of serotype C Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The botulinum toxin complex, the causative agent of botulism, passes through the  intestinal wall via sugar-chain-dependent cell binding of a haemagglutinin of 33 kDa molecular weight (HA-33). The amino-acid sequence of the C-terminal half of HA-33 of the serotype C strain Yoichi (C-Yoichi) shares only 46% identity with those of the major serotype C strains. Additionally, C-Yoichi HA-33 exhibits a unique sugar-binding specificity. In the present work, C-Yoichi HA-33 was expressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected at a resolution of 2.2 A. The crystals belonged to space group R3. The complete detailed protein structure will yield insight into how the unique HA-33 protein recognizes sugar moieties.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - High level expression, purification and immunogenicity analysis of a protective recombinant protein against botulinum neurotoxin type E.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin type E heavy chain consists of two domains: N-terminal half  as a translocation domain and C-terminal half (Hcc) as a binding domain. In this research a synthetic gene fragment encoding the binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E-Hcc) was highly expressed in Escherichia coli by pGEX4T-1 vector. After purification, the recombinant BoNT/E-Hcc was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Average yields obtained in this research were 3.7 mg recombinant BoNT/E-Hcc per liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant protein was injected in mice for study of its protection ability against botulinum neurotoxin type E challenges. The challenge studies showed that, vaccinated mice were fully protected against 10(4) x minimum lethal dose of botulinum neurotoxin type E.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of an HA17-HA70 (HA2-HA3) complex from Clostridium botulinum type C progenitor toxin.
AB  - The haemagglutinin (HA) complex of Clostridium botulinum type C toxin is composed of three types of subcomponents: HA33, HA17 and HA70 (also known as HA1, HA2 and HA3, respectively). Here, a 260 kDa HA17-HA70 complex was crystallized. His-tagged HA17 and maltose-binding-protein-tagged HA70 were expressed in Escherichia coli and their complex was affinity-purified using a combination of amylose resin chromatography and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose chromatography. Diffraction data were collected to 8.0 A resolution and the crystal belonged to the tetragonal space group P4(1)2(1)2. The molecular-replacement solution indicated that one molecule of HA17 was bound to each HA70 monomer.
TI  - Inhibitions of the translocation pore of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin by tailored azolopyridinium salts protects human cells from intoxication.
AB  - C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum represents the prototype of clostridial binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins which destroy the actin-cytoskeleton of mammalian cells and cause severe enteric diseases in humans and animals. After receptor-mediated endocytosis of the C2 toxin complex, the binding/translocation component C2IIa forms a heptameric transmembrane pore in membranes of acidified endosomal vesicles. The separate ADP-ribosyltransferase component C2I translocates through this C2IIa-pore from the endosomal lumen into the cytosol. Here we demonstrate that positively charged heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts which were developed as pore blockers for the anthrax toxins, efficiently protect cultured mammalian cells from intoxication with C2 toxin. The inhibitors had no effects on enzyme activity of C2I or receptor binding of C2 toxin but inhibited the pH-dependent membrane translocation of C2I in living cells, most likely by blocking the C2IIa-translocation pores. In vitro, the substances blocked C2IIa-pores in black lipid bilayer membranes when applied to the cis-side of the membrane which corresponds to the endosomal lumen of cells. Thus, heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts could represent lead compounds for development of novel therapeutics against binary clostridial toxins.
TI  - Vaccination of cattle with a recombinant bivalent toxoid against botulism serotypes C and D.
AB  - Cattle botulism is a fatal intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D resulting in economic losses. Vaccination is the most effective way to control botulism. However, the commercially available vaccines are difficult and hazardous to produce. Neutralizing antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the BoNT heavy chain (HC) are known to protect against lethal doses of BoNTs. We report the vaccination of cattle with a previously tested recombinant chimera consisting of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit and the HC of BoNTs C and D. Vaccinated animals produced neutralizing antibodies against serotypes C and D averaging 5+/-0 and 6.14+/-1.06IU/mL, respectively. For BoNT D, the titers were greater than those measured for the commercial vaccine, which induced titers of 5+/-0 and 2.85+/-1.35 against the respective serotypes, suggesting that this chimera is effective against cattle botulism.
TI  - Production and evaluation of a recombinant chimeric vaccine against clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types C and D.
AB  - Bovine botulism is a fatal disease that is caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D and that causes great economic losses, with nearly 100% lethality during outbreaks. It has also been considered a potential source of human food-borne illness in many countries. Vaccination has been reported to be the most effective way to control bovine botulism. However, the commercially available toxoid-based vaccines are difficult and hazardous to produce. Neutralizing antibodies targeted against the C-terminal fragment of the BoNT heavy chain (HC) are known to confer efficient protection against lethal doses of BoNTs. In this study, a novel recombinant chimera, consisting of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB), a strong adjuvant of the humoral immune response, fused to the HC of BoNT serotypes C and D, was produced in E. coli. Mice vaccinated with the chimera containing LTB and an equivalent molar ratio of the chimera without LTB plus aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) developed 2 IU/mL of antitoxins for both serotypes. Guinea pigs immunized with the recombinant chimera with LTB plus Al(OH)3 developed a protective immune response against both BoNT/C (5 IU/mL) and BoNT/D (10 IU/mL), as determined by a mouse neutralization bioassay with pooled sera. The results achieved with guinea pig sera fulfilled the requirements of commercial vaccines for prevention of botulism, as determined by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, Supply. The presence of LTB was essential for the development of a strong humoral immune response, as it acted in synergism with Al(OH)3. Thus, the vaccine described in this study is a strong candidate for the control of botulism in cattle.
TI  - Pathoscope: species identification and strain attribution with unassembled sequencing data.
AB  - Emerging next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the collection of genomic data for applications in bioforensics, biosurveillance, and for use in clinical settings. However, to make the most of these new data, new methodology needs to be developed that can accommodate large volumes of genetic data in a computationally efficient manner. We present a statistical framework to analyze raw next-generation sequence reads from purified or mixed environmental or targeted infected tissue samples for rapid species identification and strain attribution against a robust database of known biological agents. Our method, Pathoscope, capitalizes on a Bayesian statistical framework that accommodates information on sequence quality, mapping quality, and provides posterior probabilities of matches to a known database of target genomes. Importantly, our approach also incorporates the possibility that multiple species can be present in the sample and considers cases when the sample species/strain is not in the reference database. Furthermore, our approach can accurately discriminate between very closely related strains of the same species with very little coverage of the genome and without the need for multiple alignment steps, extensive homology searches, or genome assembly--which are time-consuming and labor-intensive steps. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on genomic data from purified and in silico "environmental" samples from known bacterial agents impacting human health for accuracy assessment and comparison with other approaches.
TI  - Enhancing the protective immune response against botulism.
AB  - The need for a vaccine against botulism has increased since the discontinuation of the pentavalent (ABCDE) botulinum toxoid vaccine by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are the primary virulence factors and vaccine components against botulism. BoNTs comprise three domains which are involved in catalysis (LC), translocation (HCT), and host receptor binding (HCR). Recombinant HCR subunits have been used to develop the next generation of BoNT vaccines. Using structural studies and the known entry properties of BoNT/A, an HCR subunit vaccine against BoNT/A that contained the point mutation W1266A within the ganglioside binding pocket was designed. HCR/A(W1266A) did not enter primary neurons, and the crystal structure of HCR/A(W1266A) was virtually identical to that of wild-type HCR/A. Using a mouse model, experiments were performed using a high-dose vaccine and a low-dose vaccine. At a high vaccine dose, HCR/A and HCR/A(W1266A) elicited a protective immune response to BoNT/A challenge. At the low-dose vaccination, HCR/A(W1266A) was a more protective vaccine than HCR/A. alpha-HCR IgG titers correlated with protection from BoNT challenge, although titers to block HCR/A entry were greater in serum in HCR/A-vaccinated mice than in HCR/A(W1266A)-vaccinated mice. This study shows that removal of receptor binding capacity enhances potency of the subunit HCR vaccine. Vaccines that lack receptor binding capacity have the added property of limited off-target toxicity.
TI  - Detailed analysis of metagenome datasets obtained from biogas-producing microbial communities residing in biogas reactors does not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years biogas plants in Germany have been supposed to be involved in amplification and dissemination of pathogenic bacteria causing severe infections in humans and animals. In particular, biogas plants are discussed to contribute to the spreading of Escherichia coli infections in humans or chronic botulism in cattle caused by Clostridium botulinum. Metagenome datasets of microbial communities from an agricultural biogas plant as well as from anaerobic lab-scale digesters operating at different temperatures and conditions were analyzed for the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria and virulence determinants by various bioinformatic approaches. RESULTS: All datasets featured a low abundance of reads that were taxonomically assigned to the genus Escherichia or further selected genera comprising pathogenic species. Higher numbers of reads were taxonomically assigned to the genus Clostridium. However, only very few sequences were predicted to originate from pathogenic clostridial species. Moreover, mapping of metagenome reads to complete genome sequences of selected pathogenic bacteria revealed that not the pathogenic species itself, but only species that are more or less related to pathogenic ones are present in the fermentation samples analyzed. Likewise, known virulence determinants could hardly be detected. Only a marginal number of reads showed similarity to sequences described in the Microbial Virulence Database MvirDB such as those encoding protein toxins, virulence proteins or antibiotic resistance determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this first study of metagenomic sequence reads of biogas producing microbial communities suggest that the risk of dissemination of pathogenic bacteria by application of digestates from biogas fermentations as fertilizers is low, because obtained results do not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms in the samples analyzed.
TI  - A recombinant fusion toxin based on enzymatic inactive C3bot1 selectively targets macrophages.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The C3bot1 protein (~23 kDa) from Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho. C3bot1 is selectively taken up into the cytosol of monocytes/macrophages but not of other cell types such as epithelial cells or fibroblasts. Most likely, the internalization occurs by a specific endocytotic pathway via acidified endosomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we tested whether enzymatic inactive C3bot1E174Q serves as a macrophage-selective transport system for delivery of enzymatic active proteins into the cytosol of such cells. Having confirmed that C3bot1E174Q does not induce macrophage activation, we used the actin ADP-ribosylating C2I ( approximately 50 kDa) from Clostridium botulinum as a reporter enzyme for C3bot1E174Q-mediated delivery into macrophages. The recombinant C3bot1E174Q-C2I fusion toxin was cloned and expressed as GST-protein in Escherichia coli. Purified C3bot1E174Q-C2I was recognized by antibodies against C2I and C3bot and showed C2I-specific enzyme activity in vitro. When applied to cultured cells C3bot1E174Q-C2I ADP-ribosylated actin in the cytosol of macrophages including J774A.1 and RAW264.7 cell lines as well as primary cultured human macrophages but not of epithelial cells. Together with confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments, the biochemical data indicate the selective uptake of a recombinant C3-fusion toxin into the cytosol of macrophages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, we demonstrated that C3bot1E174Q can be used as a delivery system for fast, selective and specific transport of enzymes into the cytosol of living macrophages. Therefore, C3-based fusion toxins can represent valuable molecular tools in experimental macrophage pharmacology and cell biology as well as attractive candidates to develop new therapeutic approaches against macrophage-associated diseases.
TI  - Management of microbial food safety in Arab countries.
AB  - Microbial food safety remains a major economic and public health concern in Arab  countries. Over the past several years, many of these countries have attempted to revise and upgrade food quality control and surveillance programs; however, these systems vary in scope and effectiveness. This review addresses the major reported foodborne outbreaks and multidrug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms isolated from food products. Major foodborne pathogens of concern included Brucella spp., Clostridium botulinum, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus. Measures for managing microbial food hazards based on a comprehensive risk analysis also are proposed.
TI  - CbrA is a flavin adenine dinucleotide protein that modifies the Escherichia coli  outer membrane and confers specific resistance to Colicin M.
AB  - Colicin M (Cma) is a protein toxin produced by Escherichia coli that kills sensitive E. coli cells by inhibiting murein biosynthesis in the periplasm. Recombinant plasmids carrying cbrA (formerly yidS) strongly increased resistance of cells to Cma, whereas deletion of cbrA increased Cma sensitivity. Transcription of cbrA is positively controlled by the two-component CreBC system. A DeltacreB mutant was highly Cma sensitive because little CbrA was synthesized. Treatment of CbrA-overproducing cells by osmotic shock failed to render cells Cma sensitive because the cells were resistant to osmotic shock. In a natural environment with a growth-limiting nutrient supply, cells producing CbrA defend themselves against colicin M synthesized by competing cells. Isolated CbrA is a protein with noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. Sequence comparison and structure prediction assign the closest relative of CbrA with a known crystal structure as digeranylgeranyl-glycerophospholipid reductase of Thermoplasma acidophilum. CbrA is found in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, and Salmonella bongori but not in other enterobacteria. The next homologs with the highest identity (over 50%) are found in the anaerobic Clostridium botulinum group 1 and a few other Firmicutes.
TI  - Carbohydrate recognition mechanism of HA70 from Clostridium botulinum deduced from X-ray structures in complexes with sialylated oligosaccharides.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum produces the botulinum neurotoxin, forming a large complex  as progenitor toxins in association with non-toxic non-hemagglutinin and/or several different hemagglutinin (HA) subcomponents, HA33, HA17 and HA70, which bind to carbohydrate of glycoproteins from epithelial cells in the infection process. To elucidate the carbohydrate recognition mechanism of HA70, X-ray structures of HA70 from type C toxin (HA70/C) in complexes with sialylated oligosaccharides were determined, and a binding assay by the glycoconjugate microarray was performed. These results suggested that HA70/C can recognize both alpha2-3- and alpha2-6-sialylated oligosaccharides, and that it has a higher affinity for alpha2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides.
TI  - Deletion mutant comprising 198 residues of BoNT/A toxin receptor binding domain retained gt1b binding property but failed to induce protective antibody response in a mouse model.
AB  - The most effective protection against toxin is inducing protective immune response through vaccination that will produce neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies will bind to and clear toxin from the circulation before it can enter nerve cells and block neurotransmission and can also be used for development of detection system. In the present study we constructed a deletion mutant of the binding domain (1098-1296) to produce smallest toxin fragment as vaccine candidate against BoNT/A. The BoNT/A-HCC protein was highly expressed in Escherichia coli SG13009 and found to form inclusion bodies. The purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl containing 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM imidazole and the rBoNT/A-HCC was purified and refolded in a single step on Ni2+ affinity column. The purified protein was approximately 98 % pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel with the yield of 8 mg/L and showed binding to polysialoganglioside (GT1b). The rBoNT/A-HCC at dose of 40 mug/mouse generated high IgG antibody titre with predominance of IgG1 subtype, but failed to protect animals against BoNT/A challenge. Antibody titre in serum was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and specific binding to rBoNT/A-HCC was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), with a dissociation constant of 0.8 pM.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the Clostridium botulinum type  D nontoxic nonhaemagglutinin.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) as a large toxin complex assembled with nontoxic nonhaemagglutinin (NTNHA) and/or haemagglutinin components. Complex formation with NTNHA is considered to be critical in eliciting food poisoning because the complex shields the BoNT from the harsh conditions in the digestive tract. In the present study, NTNHA was expressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 3.9 A resolution. The crystal belonged to the trigonal space group P321 or P3(1)21/P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 147.85, c = 229.74 A. The structure of NTNHA will provide insight into the assembly mechanism that produces the unique BoNT-NTNHA complex.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

AB  - This paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. For protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. In 2011 verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli O104:H4 has been isolated in Germany. Strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from Egypt. It was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli genes (aatA, aggR, aap, aggA, aggC) and resistance to most antibiotics. In Poland only three cases of disease caused by O104:H4 strain have been reported. Another emergence pathogen in Poland is Yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1B. It is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the USA only. Food-borne is commonly associated with raw or undercooked pork. The source of Yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. The presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. Botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum and some strains of Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii. Based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types A-G, however only types A, B, E and F are toxic to humans and some animals. Increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing bacteria, particularly Enterobacteriaceae. Until recently strains ESBL+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. Increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by MRSA. The occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. The carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. Most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus. An increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. Reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. Viruses may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food
TI  - Epitope characterization of sero-specific monoclonal antibody to Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are extremely potent toxins that can contaminate foods and are a public health concern. Anti-BoNT antibodies have been described that are capable of detecting BoNTs; however there still exists a need for accurate and sensitive detection capabilities for BoNTs. Herein, we describe the characterization of a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated to the non-toxic receptor-binding domain of BoNT/A (H(C)50/A) developed using a high-throughput screening approach. In two independent hybridoma fusions, two groups of four IgG MAbs were developed against recombinant H(C)50/A. Of these eight, only a single MAb, F90G5-3, bound to the whole BoNT/A protein and was characterized further. The F90G5-3 MAb slightly prolonged time to death in an in vivo mouse bioassay and was mapped by pepscan to a peptide epitope in the N-terminal subdomain of H(C)50/A (H(CN)25/A) comprising amino acid residues (985)WTLQDTQEIKQRVVF(999), an epitope that is highly immunoreactive in humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F90G5-3 binds BoNT/A with nanomolar efficiency. Together, our results indicate that F90G5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for BoNT/A capture assay development and bio-forensic analysis.
TI  - Using temperature and time criteria to control the effectiveness of continuous thermal sanitation of piggery effluent in terms of set microbial indicators.
AB  - AIM: To determine the minimal conditions (temperature-time), necessary to achieve set sanitation targets for selected microbial indicators during the continuous thermal treatment of pig slurry. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effectiveness of thermal treatment between 55 and 96 degrees C was studied using Escherichia coli, enterococci, sulfite-reducing Clostridia (SRC), mesophilic culturable bacteria (MCB), F+-specific and somatic phages. Identification of SRC and MCB was performed using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Ten minutes at 70 degrees C or 1 h at 60 degrees C was sufficient to reduce the vegetative bacteria by 4-5 log(10), but it had little effect on somatic phages nor on spore formers, dominated by Clostridium sp. At 96 degrees C, somatic phages were still detected, but there was a reduction of 3.1 log(10) for SRC and of 1.4 log(10) for MCB. At 96 degrees C, Clostridium botulinum was identified among the thermotolerant MCB. CONCLUSION: Only those hygienic risks relating to mesophilic vegetative bacteria can be totally eliminated from pig slurry treated at 60 degrees C (60 min) or 70 degrees C (<10 min). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Hygiene standards based on the removal of the indicators E. coli and enterococci can easily be met by treatment as low as 60 degrees C (enabling, a low-cost treatment using heat recovery). However, even at 96 degrees C, certain pathogens may persist.
TI  - High level expression of recombinant BoNT/A-Hc by high cell density cultivation of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The carboxylic domain of the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain (BoNT/A-HC), which has been reported as a vaccine candidate, contains the principle protective antigenic determinants. In this study, the high level expression of the BoNT/A-Hc was achieved by high cell density cultivation of recombinant Escherichia coli in a 2-l batch stirred-tank bioreactor. In order to maximize protein expression, post-induction time and IPTG inducer concentration were optimized by the Taguchi statistical design method. Results showed that the middle of the logarithmic phase and an IPTG concentration of 1 mM presented the optimum conditions for the maximum expression of BoNT/A-HC. High cell density cultivation was subsequently carried out as an effective strategy for the high level expression of recombinant BoNT/A-Hc. Consequently, soluble BoNT/A-Hc was produced at the maximum level of 486 mg l(-1), at 3 h post-induction, which was approximately 9.3 and 7.8 times higher than the levels produced by the shake flask and batch culturing methods, respectively.
TI  - Development of immunodetection system for botulinum neurotoxin type B using synthetic gene based recombinant protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Botulinum neurotoxins (A-G) are among most poisonous substances in the world, produced by obligate anaerobic bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Among the seven serotypes A, B, E and F are of human importance. In India, the prevalence of C. botulinum as well as botulism outbreaks have been reported. Due to its extreme toxicity it has been classified in the Category A of biological warfare agent. So far, there is no commercial detection system available in India to detect botulism. The present study aims to develop an immuno detection system for botulinum neurotoxin serotype B using synthetic gene approach. METHODS: The truncated fragment of the botulinum neurotoxin type B from amino acid 1-450 was synthesized using PCR overlap primers; the constructed gene was cloned in the pQE30UA vector and transformed to Escherichia coli SG 13009. The recombinant protein expression was optimized using various concentration of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) induction, further the expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-His antibody. Recombinant protein was purified under denatured condition using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Antibody was generated against the recombinant protein using alum adjuvant in BALB/c mice and tested for cross reactivity with other serotypes of C. botulinum as well as closely related clostridia. An ELISA test was developed for the detection of botulinum neurotoxin and the minimum detection limit was also estimated. RESULTS: The recombinant protein was expressed at maximum yield at 4.3 h of post-induction with 0.5 mM IPTG concentration. The recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography up to the homogeneity level. The polyclonal antibodies were raised in mice with a titre of 1:2,048,000. The developed antibody was highly specific with a sensitivity of detecting approximately 15 ng/ml of recombinant protein and not showing any cross-reactivity with other serotypes. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: There is no commercial immunodetection system available in India to detect botulism. The developed detection system is highly specific. It will be useful for growing food industry to detect botulinum neurotoxin in food samples as well as in clinical samples.
TI  - Inhibition of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium sporogenes in spinach packaged in modified atmospheres after treatment combined with chlorine and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Implementation of modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) into retail produce is a less commonly practiced method due to differences among commodities and the potential growth of anaerobes. Pathogens including Escherichia coli O157:H7 have been responsible for spinach outbreaks across the United States. In this study, hurdles, including those currently used with produce safety, such as MAP and chlorine, were combined with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to inhibit pathogens. Spinach was coinoculated with E. coli O157:H7 and Clostridium sporogenes, a surrogate for C. botulinum, and treated with water or a hurdle that included water, chlorine, and LAB. Spinach from treatments were packaged in air (traditional), oxygen (80% O(2), 20% CO(2)), or nitrogen (80% N(2), 20% CO(2)) and stored in a retail display case for 9 d at 4 to 7 degrees C. The hurdle inhibited E. coli O157:H7 and C. sporogenes compared to controls with reductions of 1.43 and 1.10 log (P < 0.05), respectively. The nitrogen atmosphere was outperformed by air and oxygen in the reduction of E. coli O157:H7 (P < 0.05) with a decrease of 0.26 and 0.15 logs. There were no significant differences among the 3 atmospheres on C. sporogenes survival. Relative to these hurdles, we also chose to evaluate the potential benefits of LAB in pathogen control. The survival of LAB in interventions demonstrates implementation of LAB into produce could control pathogens, without damaging produce or altering organoleptic properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The goal of our work was to identify methods that could reduce food-borne pathogens in packaged spinach products. Using current industry techniques in combination with unique methods, such as the use of beneficial bacteria, our research identified whether harmful microorganisms could be eliminated. Our data demonstrate that specific packaging conditions with beneficial bacteria can help eliminate or reduce the survival of E. coli O157:H7 and C. sporogenes (a model for C. botulinum) in produce.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - High-level expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of the receptor-binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype D.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly toxic proteins for humans and animals that are responsible for the deadly neuroparalytic disease botulism. Here, details of the expression and purification of the receptor-binding domain (HCR) of BoNT/D in Escherichia coli are presented. Using a codon-optimized cDNA, BoNT/D_HCR was expressed at a high level (150-200 mg per litre of culture) in the soluble fraction. Following a three-step purification protocol, very pure (>98%) BoNT/D_HCR was obtained. The recombinant BoNT/D_HCR was crystallized and the crystals diffracted to 1.65 A resolution. The crystals belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=60.8, b=89.7, c=93.9 A. Preliminary crystallographic data analysis revealed the presence of one molecule in the asymmetric unit.
TI  - Internalization of biotinylated compounds into cancer cells is promoted by a molecular Trojan horse based upon core streptavidin and clostridial C2 toxin.
AB  - The C2 toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum is a binary AB-type exotoxin composed of the enzyme subunit C2I and the binding/translocation moiety C2II. After proteolytic activation, C2IIa mediates the subsequent internalization of C2I into the cytosol of mammalian target cells. The N-terminal domain of C2I (C2IN) is necessary for C2IIa-dependent uptake, but lacks the enzyme domain that is responsible for cytotoxicity. In the present study, we generated a delivery system building on C2IN and a truncated core streptavidin (Stv13) with enhanced solubility for the C2IIa-dependent internalization of biotinylated cargo molecules into mammalian cells. C2IN-Stv13 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli was obtained in high yields and purity. The affinity-purified protein formed tetramers and a defined higher order species in solution as shown by gel filtration and retained its biotin-binding properties, however with an obvious reduction in affinity. Uptake of C2IN-Stv13 into the cytosol of HeLa and other cancer cell lines was observed by immunoblot analysis, which was corroborated by confocal microscopy. In addition, the fusion protein was not cytotoxic and did not inhibit cell proliferation as determined by MTS assay. Finally, we demonstrated the C2IN-Stv13/C2IIa-mediated uptake of biocytin-Alexa 488 as cargo into HeLa cells, underscoring the functionality of the generated transport system.
TI  - Characterization of LC-HCC fusion protein of botulinum neurotoxin type A.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. The gene for encoding the full length light chain with H(CC) (binding) domain of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin A was synthesized and cloned into a bacterial expression vector pQE30-UA and produced as an N-terminally six-histidine-tagged fusion protein (rBoNT/A LC-H(CC)). This protein was expressed in two different strains of Escherichia coli namely BL21(DE3) and SG13009. Expression at 37 degrees C revealed localization of rBoNT/A LC- H(CC) in inclusion body whereas it was expressed in soluble form at 21 degrees C. The recombinant fusion protein was purified by nickel affinity gel column chromatography and identified by monoclonal antibody and peptide mass fingerprinting. The recombinant protein was shown to bind with synaptic vesicles and gangliosides (GT1b) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rBoNT/A LC-H(CC) was also found to be highly active on its substrate (SNAP-25) from rat brain, indicating that the expressed and purified rBoNT/A LC-H(CC) protein retains a functionally active conformation. Biologically active recombinant fusion protein was also evaluated for its immunological potential.
TI  - Differential role of Rho GTPases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.
AB  - Maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier functions is crucial to prevent systemic contamination by microbes that penetrate from the gut lumen. GTPases of the Rho-family such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are known to be critically involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. However, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these GTPases exerts barrier protection or not. We tested the effects of Rho GTPase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF-1), toxin B, C3 transferase (C3 TF), and lethal toxin (LT) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Incubation of cell monolayers with CNF-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of RhoA whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were unchanged. As revealed by FITC-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. Inhibition of Rho kinase via Y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of CNF-1 after 3 h. In contrast, after 24 h of incubation with CNF-1 only Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA were activated which resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. Toxin B to inactivate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as well as Rac1 inhibitor LT increased intestinal epithelial permeability. Similar effects were observed after inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling by C3 TF or Y27632. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of RhoA signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.
TI  - Surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks --- United States, 2007.
AB  - Foodborne agents cause an estimated 76 million illnesses annually in the United States. Outbreak surveillance provides insights into the causes of foodborne illness, types of implicated foods, and settings of foodborne infections that can be used in food safety strategies to prevent and control foodborne disease. CDC collects data on foodborne disease outbreaks submitted from all states and territories. This report summarizes epidemiologic data for the 1,097 reported outbreaks occurring during 2007 (the most recent finalized data), which resulted in 21,244 cases of foodborne illness and 18 deaths. Among the 497 foodborne outbreaks with a laboratory-confirmed single etiologic agent reported, norovirus was the most common cause, followed by Salmonella. Among the 18 reported deaths, 11 were attributed to bacterial etiologies (five Salmonella, three Listeria monocytogenes, two Escherichia coli O157:H7, and one Clostridium botulinum), two to viral etiologies (norovirus), and one to a chemical (mushroom toxin). Four deaths occurred in outbreaks with unknown etiologies. Among the 235 outbreaks attributed to a single food commodity, poultry (17%), beef (16%), and leafy vegetables (14%) were most often the cause of illness. Public health, regulatory, and agricultural professionals can use this information when creating targeted control strategies and to support efforts to promote safe food preparation practices among food employees and the public.
TI  - Detection of botulinum neurotoxin serotype B at sub mouse LD(50) levels by a sandwich immunoassay and its application to toxin detection in milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), the causative agent of botulism, a serious neuroparylatic disease, is produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum and consists of a family of seven serotypes (A-H). We previously reported production of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies to BoNT serotype A. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant peptide fragments of the light chain, the transmembrane and receptor-binding domains of the heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin type B (BoNT/B) were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-fusion proteins and purified. These proteins were used to immunize BALB/cJ mice for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Antibody-producing hybridomas were detected using either a direct binding ELISA binding to plate-immobilized BoNT/B, or with a capture-capture ELISA whereby the capacity of the antibody to capture BoNT/B from solution was tested. A total of five mAbs were selected, two of which bound the toxin light chain and three bound the receptor-binding domain of BoNT/B heavy chain. MAb MCS6-27 was identified via capture-capture ELISA and was the only mAb able to bind BoNT/B in solution under physiological conditions. MAbs F24-1, F26-16, F27-33 and F29-40 were identified via direct binding ELISA, and were able to capture BoNT/B in solution only in the presence of 0.5-0.9 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). MAb MCS6-27 and an anti-BoNT/B polyclonal antibody were incorporated into a sandwich ELISA that did not require SDS. CONCLUSIONS: We report here the generation of monoclonal antibodies to serotype B and the subsequent development of a sensitive sandwich immunoassay. This immunoassay has a detection limit of 100 fg BoNT/B, fifty times more sensitive than the mouse bioassay detection limit of 5 pg BoNT/B. Additionally, this assay detected as little as 39 pg/mL of toxin in skim, 2% and whole milk.
TI  - Expression of Hc fragment from Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype B in Escherichia coli and its use as a good immunogen.
AB  - A good immunogen was developed as an effective recombinant vaccine candidate that protected mice against botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNT/B) intoxication. The Hc fragment of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type B (rBoNT/B-Hc) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-30, and the resulting vector was successfully expressed in the Escherichia coli M15 strain. The purified rBoNT/B-Hc protein was used to vaccinate mice and evaluate their survival against challenge with native BoNT/B. The mice that received three subcutaneous injections of rBoNT/B-Hc immunogen doses ranging from 0.25 to 6.25 mug mixed with Freund's adjuvant were completely protected against an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10,000 50% lethal doses (LD50) of BoNT/B. A dose response was observed in both the ELISA antibody titers and protective efficacy with increasing dose of immunogen. The work presented here demonstrates that the purified rBoNT/B-Hc was a highly effective immunogen and able to protect against a high-dose neurotoxin challenge.
TI  - Rapid affinity immunochromatography column-based tests for sensitive detection of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins and Escherichia coli O157.
AB  - Existing methods for detection of food-borne pathogens and their toxins are frequently time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and involve lengthy culture procedures and/or animal testing and are thus unsuitable for a rapid response to an emergency public health situation. A series of simple and rapid affinity immunochromatography column (AICC) assays were developed to detect Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, E, and F and Escherichia coli O157 in food matrices. Specifically, for milk, grape juice with peach juice, and bottled water, the detection limit for the botulinum neurotoxin type A complex was 0.5 ng. Use of this method with a 10-ml sample would therefore result in a detection limit of 50 pg ml(-l). Thus, this assay is approximately 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a comparable lateral-flow assay. For botulinum neurotoxin complex types B, E, and F, the minimum detection limit was 5 ng to 50 ng. Sensitive detection of E. coli O157 was achieved, and the detection limit was 500 cells. The AICC test was also shown to be specific, rapid, and user friendly. This test takes only 15 to 30 min to complete without any specialized equipment and thus is suitable for use in the field. It has the potential to replace existing methods for presumptive detection of botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, E, and F and E. coli O157 in contaminated matrices without a requirement for preenrichment.
TI  - Optimization of the BoNT/A-Hc expression in recombinant Escherichia coli using the Taguchi statistical method.
AB  - The use of the recombinant BoNT/A-Hc (carboxylic domain of the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain) has been proposed as a vaccine candidate for botulism. This fragment contains the principle protective antigenic determinant. In the present study, in order to maximize recombinant protein expression, after verification of recombinant BoNT/A-Hc by Western blotting, modified M9 medium was selected as a simple medium, and the operational and medium-composition variables together with their interactions were optimized by using the Taguchi statistical method. ANOVA for the obtained data indicated that 3.5 g, 15 g, 30 g, 15 g, 4 g, 0.7 mM, 1.5 ml per litre of medium, 30 degrees C and 15 h represented optimum values of (NH(4))(2)SO(4), glucose, K(2)HPO(4), KH(2)PO(4), MgSO(4) * 7H(2)O, isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside concentration, trace-elements solution, temperature and post-induction time respectively. Consequently, under these optimum conditions, 52.1 mg/l of soluble BoNT/A-Hc was obtained in shake flask culture.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Genetically engineered clostridial C2 toxin as a novel delivery system for living mammalian cells.
AB  - The C2 toxin of Clostridium botulinum is a binary bacterial protein toxin, comprising the enzyme component C2I and the separate binding/translocation component C2IIa. C2IIa mediates the transport of C2I into the host cell cytosol. The N-terminal domain of C2I (C2IN) is enzymatically inactive but essential for C2IIa-mediated internalization of C2I. Here, we exploit the C2IIa/C2IN system to generate a recombinant C2IN-streptavidin fusion protein allowing for the delivery of biotinylated molecules into the cytosol of mammalian cells. C2IN-streptavidin overproduced in E. coli was affinity-purified and capable of binding biotinylated proteins in a concentration-dependent manner. Real-time surface plasmon resonance confirmed the biotin-mediated interaction yielding a K(D)-value of approximately 0.75 muM. Internalization of C2IN-streptavidin into the cytosol of epithelial cells and macrophages was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis and confirmed by confocal microscopy. Cell viability studies showed no cytotoxic effects of the novel transporter. Furthermore, Vero cells treated with biotin-fluorescein or biocytin-Alexa488 as model cargo displayed a specific C2IN-streptavidin/C2IIa-dependent uptake, providing proof-of-principle for the functionality of this novel delivery system.
TI  - EtfA catalyses the formation of dipicolinic acid in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Dipicolinic acid (DPA) is a major component of bacterial endospores, comprising 5-15% of the spore dry weight, and is important for spore stability and resistance properties. The biosynthetic precursor to DPA, dihydro-dipicolinic acid (DHDPA), is produced by DHDPA synthase within the lysine biosynthesis pathway. In Bacillus subtilis, and most other bacilli and clostridia, DHDPA is oxidized to DPA by the products of the spoVF operon. Analysis of the genomes of the clostridia in Cluster I, including the pathogens Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, has shown that no spoVF orthologues exist in these organisms. DPA synthase was purified from extracts of sporulating C. perfringens cells. Peptide sequencing identified an electron transfer flavoprotein, EtfA, in this purified protein fraction. A C. perfringens strain with etfA inactivated is blocked in late stage sporulation and produces < or = 11% of wild-type DPA levels. C. perfringens EtfA was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and this protein catalysed DPA formation in vitro. The sequential production of DHDPA and DPA in C. perfringens appears to be catalysed by DHDPA synthase followed by EtfA. Genome sequence data and the taxonomy of spore-forming species suggest that this may be the ancestral mechanism for DPA synthesis.
TI  - Improved soluble expression and characterization of the Hc domain of Clostridium  botulinum neurotoxin serotype A in Escherichia coli by using a PCR-synthesized gene and a Trx co-expression strain.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is an extremely potent bacterial protein toxin. The Hc fragment of BoNT/A (AHc) was shown to be non-toxic, antigenic, and capable of eliciting a protective immunity in animals challenged with homologous BoNT. In this study, we synthesized AHc gene by using T4 DNA ligase and PCR. The AHc was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli successfully. Because of using the Trx co-expression strain, the expressed AHc is in a soluble and active form. The yield of the purified AHc was about 70mg/L, and its purity was up to 90% through one-step affinity chromatography. The AHc was positively identified by the antibodies raised against BoNT/A using immunological-dot-blot and Western blot assays. AHc was shown to bind with gangliosides and elicit immunity against BoNT/A, indicating that the expressed and purified AHc protein retains a functionally active conformation. Furthermore, the purified AHc has a strong immunogenicity and can be used as a potential subunit candidate vaccine for botulinum toxin serotype A.
TI  - Expression of the Clostridium botulinum A2 neurotoxin gene cluster proteins and characterization of the A2 complex.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum subtype A2 possesses a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) gene cluster consisting of an orfX cluster containing open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown functions. To better understand the association between the BoNT/A2 complex proteins, first, the orfX cluster proteins (ORFX1, ORFX3, P47, and the middle part of NTNH) from C. botulinum A2 strain Kyoto F and NTNH of A1 strain ATCC 3502 were expressed by using either an Escherichia coli or a C. botulinum expression system. Polyclonal antibodies against individual orfX cluster proteins were prepared by immunizing a rabbit and mice against the expressed proteins. Antibodies were then utilized as probes to determine which of the A2 orfX cluster genes were expressed in the native A2 culture. N-terminal protein sequencing was also employed to specifically detect ORFX2. Results showed that all of the neurotoxin cluster proteins, except ORFX1, were expressed in the A2 culture. A BoNT/A2 toxin complex (TC) was purified which showed that C. botulinum A2 formed a medium-size (300-kDa) TC composed of BoNT/A2 and NTNH without any of the other OrfX cluster proteins. NTNH subtype-specific immunoreactivity was also discovered, allowing for the differentiation of subtypes based on cluster proteins associated with BoNT.
TI  - Cloning, high level expression and immunogenicity of 1163-1256 residues of C-terminal heavy chain of C. botulinum neurotoxin type E.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. BoNTs consist of a toxifying light chain and a heavy chain (HC) linked through a disulfide bond. In the present study we explored the immunogenicity and protective capability of the most effective part corresponding to 1163-1256 residues of botulinum type E neurotoxin HC gene. DNA encoding the 93 C-terminal amino acid of HC residues was synthesized with optimal codon usage for expression. These DNA fragments were ligated into a pLivSelect vector and subcloned into expression vector pET32a. Recombinant plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3. The recombinant protein was purified by nickel affinity gel column chromatography. The HC1163-1256 was identified by antibodies raised against BoNT/E. HC1163-1256 was shown to bind with synaptotagmin and gangliosides, indicating that the expressed and purified HC1163-1256 protein retains a functionally active conformation. The immunization with recombinant protein induced a protection level in mice. The immunization with 2mug of the recombinant protein induced a significant protection level in mice. In conclusion, availability of the recombinant protein provides an effective system to study the biochemical and physical interactions involved during BoNT binding to nerve cells and protection against its toxicity.
TI  - Exploring historical Canadian foodborne outbreak data sets for human illness attribution.
AB  - Human illness attribution has been recently recognized as an important tool to better inform food safety decisions. Analysis of outbreak data sets has been used for that purpose. This study was conducted to explore the usefulness of three comprehensive Canadian foodborne outbreak data sets covering 30 years for estimating food attribution in cases of gastrointestinal illness, providing Canadian food attribution estimates from a historical perspective. Information concerning the microbiological etiology and food vehicles recorded for each outbreak was standardized between the data sets. The agent-food vehicle combinations were described and analyzed for changes over time by using multiple correspondence analysis. Overall, 6,908 foodborne outbreaks were available for three decades (1976 through 2005), but the agent and the food vehicle were identified in only 2,107 of these outbreaks. Differences between the data sets were found in the distribution of the cause, the vehicle, and the location or size of the outbreaks. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed an association between Clostridium botulinum and wild meat and between C. botulinum and seafood. This analysis also highlighted changes in food attribution over time and generated the most up-to-date food attribution values for salmonellosis (29% of cases associated with produce, 15% with poultry, and 15% with meat other than poultry, pork, and beef), campylobacteriosis (56% of cases associated with poultry and 22% with dairy products other than fluid milk), and Escherichia coli infection (37% of cases associated with beef, 23% with cooked multi-ingredient dishes, and 11% with meat other than beef, poultry, and pork). Because of the inherent limitations of this approach, only the main findings should be considered for policy making. The use of other human illness attribution approaches may provide further clarification.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.
TI  - Foodborne and indicator bacteria in farmed molluscan shellfish before and after depuration.
AB  - Galicia's coast (northwestern Spain) is a major producer of bivalve molluscs. Over an 18-month period, the presence of Salmonella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Clostridium botulinum was determined by PCR methods in mussels (22 batches) and infaunal bivalves (31 batches of clams and cockles) before and after depuration. All batches were harvested from Galician class B harvesting areas where bivalve molluscs must not exceed 4,600 Escherichia coli per 100 g of flesh and liquor in 90% of the samples. Virulence-associated genes of Salmonella (invA), Aeromonas (aerA, hlyA, alt, ast, and laf), P. shigelloides (hugA), V. parahaemolyticus (tdh and trh), and C. botulinum (BoNT) were not detected. The pR72H chromosomal DNA fragment, which is conservative in V. parahaemolyticus strains, was detected in five (4.7%) samples. A number of 192 suspect isolates did not fit the description of clinical Aeromonas phenospecies, pathogenic Vibrio spp., or P. shigelloides. The effectiveness of commercial depuration in reducing bacterial indicators was also examined. E. coli was reduced to < or = 230/100 g of flesh and liquor in 90.9% of mussel lots but in only 70.9% of infaunal bivalve lots. For total coliform elimination, mussels were also more effective. Total counts significantly (P < 0.005) correlated with numbers of Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Vibrio. Our data indicate that Salmonella and pathogenic bacteria indigenous to estuarine environments do not appear to be significant hazards in Galician molluscan shellfish. A reason for concern, however, is that clearance of E. coli to acceptable levels was not always achieved especially in infaunal bivalves.
TI  - Surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks - United States, 2006.
AB  - Foodborne illnesses are a major health burden in the United States. Most of these illnesses are preventable, and analysis of outbreaks helps identify control measures. Although most cases are sporadic, investigation of the portion that occur as part of recognized outbreaks can provide insights into the pathogens, food vehicles, and food-handling practices associated with foodborne infections. CDC collects data on foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) from all states and territories through the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FBDSS). This report summarizes epidemiologic data on FBDOs reported during 2006 (the most recent year for which data have been analyzed). A total of 1,270 FBDOs were reported, resulting in 27,634 cases and 11 deaths. Among the 624 FBDOs with a confirmed etiology, norovirus was the most common cause, accounting for 54% of outbreaks and 11,879 cases, followed by Salmonella (18% of outbreaks and 3,252 cases). Among the 11 reported deaths, 10 were attributed to bacterial etiologies (six Escherichia coli O157:H7, two Listeria monocytogenes, one Salmonella serotype Enteritidis, and one Clostridium botulinum), and one was attributed to a chemical (mushroom toxin). Among outbreaks caused by a single food vehicle, the most common food commodities to which outbreak-related cases were attributed were poultry (21%), leafy vegetables (17%), and fruits/nuts (16%). Public health professionals can use this information to 1) target control strategies for specific pathogens in particular foods along the farm-to-table continuum and 2) support good food-handling practices among restaurant workers and the public.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - The recombinant Hc subunit of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A is an effective botulism vaccine candidate.
AB  - Vaccination with recombinant His-tagged isoforms of the Clostridium botulinum Hc  domain of neurotoxin serotype A (rAHc) have effectively protected against challenge with active botulinum neurotoxin serotype A. To establish a formulation suitable for human use, rAHc was expressed in Escherichia coli without a His-tag and purified by sequential chromatography on ion-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction resins. Purified rAHc was used to vaccinate mice and survival was evaluated following challenge with active toxin. rAHc-vaccinated mice were protected against an active toxin challenge in mouse models of disease and a dose-response relationship was observed between the dose of rAHc administered and protection. Vaccination with rAHc in the presence or absence of adjuvants was also tested following intramuscular or subcutaneous vaccination to determine the optimal route of vaccination in the context of active toxin challenge. The data presented in the report suggested that rAHc administered with or without adjuvants functioned effectively over time in protecting mice against challenge with neurotoxin suggesting that this form of rAHc may be developed into a human vaccine candidate designed for the prevention of botulism.
TI  - Expression and stability of the nontoxic component of the botulinum toxin complex.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) as a large toxin complex associated with nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (NTNHA) and/or hemagglutinin components. In the present study, high-level expression of full-length (1197 amino acids) rNTNHA from C. botulinum serotype D strain 4947 (D-4947) was achieved in an Escherichia coli system. Spontaneous nicking of the rNTNHA at a specific site was observed during long-term incubation in the presence of protease inhibitors; this was also observed in natural NTNHA. The rNTNHA assembled with isolated D-4947 BoNT with molar ratio 1:1 to form a toxin complex. The reconstituted toxin complex exhibited dramatic resistance to proteolysis by pepsin or trypsin at high concentrations, despite the fact that the isolated BoNT and rNTNHA proteins were both easily degraded. We provide definitive evidence that NTNHA plays a crucial role in protecting BoNT, which is an oral toxin, from digestion by proteases common in the stomach and intestine.
TI  - [Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica].
AB  - Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica. Unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in Costa Rica and other Neotropical countries. It has been used in the topic treatment of infected wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria. We studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. The analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of Clostridium botulinum. The antimicrobial effect was tested for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger (Asni 06). Most of the samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 CFU/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 CFU/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher than 10(2) CFU/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; C. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. No inhibitory effect was observed for A. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Production of serotype C specific and serotype C/D generic monoclonal antibodies  using recombinant H(C) and H(N) fragments from Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types C(1) and D.
AB  - Sequence variability of Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D is particularly complex. Some serotype C and D strains have unique gene structures that encode mosaic isoforms of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) containing components of both BoNT type C(1) (BoNT/C(1)) and BoNT type D (BoNT/D). Such sequence variability and the potential for cross neutralisation must be taken into consideration when developing serotype C and D detection and identification assays. Three fusion proteins containing either a fragment from the carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain (H(C)) of BoNT/C(1) (strain 573), a fragment from the H(C) of BoNT/D (strain BVD/-3) or a fragment from the amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain (H(N)) of BoNT/C(1) (strain 573) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and administered as immunogens to mice. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the recombinant BoNT fragments were prepared by three fusions. MAbs recognising native BoNT/C(1) and BoNT/D were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced, six of which recognised a BoNT fragment that is highly conserved across all serotype C and D producing strains. We conclude that these mAbs and this approach to mAb production may facilitate the development of immunological diagnostic techniques that are not constrained by the existence of mosaic isoforms for the detection and identification of serotypes C and D.
TI  - Extracting survival parameters from isothermal, isobaric, and "iso-concentration" inactivation experiments by the "3 end points method".
AB  - Theoretically, if an organism's resistance can be characterized by 3 survival parameters, they can be found by solving 3 simultaneous equations that relate the final survival ratio to the lethal agent's intensity. (For 2 resistance parameters, 2 equations will suffice.) In practice, the inevitable experimental scatter would distort the results of such a calculation or render the method unworkable. Averaging the results obtained with more than 3 final survival ratio triplet combinations, determined in four or more treatments, can remove this impediment. This can be confirmed by the ability of a kinetic inactivation model derived from the averaged parameters to predict survival patterns under conditions not employed in their determination, as demonstrated with published isothermal survival data of Clostridium botulinum spores, isobaric data of Escherichia coli under HPP, and Pseudomonas exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Both the method and the underlying assumption that the inactivation followed a Weibull-Log logistic (WeLL) kinetics were confirmed in this way, indicating that when an appropriate survival model is available, it is possible to predict the entire inactivation curves from several experimental final survival ratios alone. Where applicable, the method could simplify the experimental procedure and lower the cost of microbial resistance determinations. In principle, the methodology can be extended to deteriorative chemical reactions if they too can be characterized by 2 or 3 kinetic parameters.
TI  - Protection with a recombinant Hc of Clostridium Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A from Escherichia coli as an effective subunit vaccine.
AB  - A recombinant Hc of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (AHc) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli for use as an antigen, and the purified AHc was used to vaccinate mice and evaluate their survival against challenge with active botulinum neurotoxin serotype A. The mice, given twice or third subcutaneous vaccinations with a dosage of 1 microg AHc mixed with Freund adjuvant, were completely protected against an intraperitoneal administration of 1,000,000 50% lethal doses (LD(50)) of neurotoxin serotype A. Following the administration of AHc using alhydrogel adjuvant via the intramuscular route, a strong protective immune response was also elicited in the vaccinated mice. A dose-response was observed in protective efficacy with increasing AHc dosage and number of vaccinations. Mice that received two injections of >or= 0.2 microg and three injections of >or= 0.04 microg were completely protected when challenged with 100,000 LD(50) of neurotoxin serotype A. These results clearly suggest that the recombinant AHc highly expressed in Escherichia coli is very efficacious in protecting against challenge with active botulinum neurotoxin serotype A in mouse model and a good subunit candidate vaccine against botulinum neurotoxin serotype A for human use.
TI  - Evaluation of a recombinant Hc of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype F as  an effective subunit vaccine.
AB  - A new gene encoding the Hc domain of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype F  (FHc) was designed and completely synthesized with oligonucleotides. A soluble recombinant Hc of C. botulinum neurotoxin serotype F was highly expressed in Escherichia coli with this synthetic FHc gene. Subsequently, the purified FHc was used to vaccinate mice and evaluate their survival against challenge with active botulinum neurotoxin serotype F (BoNT/F). After the administration of FHc protein mixed with Freund adjuvant via the subcutaneous route, a strong protective immune response was elicited in the vaccinated mice. Mice that were given two or three vaccinations with a dosage of 1 or 10 microg of FHc were completely protected against an intraperitoneal administration of 20,000 50% lethal doses (LD50) of BoNT/F. The BoNT/F neutralization assay showed that the sera from these vaccinated mice contained high titers of protective antibodies. Furthermore, mice were vaccinated once, twice, or three times at four different dosages of FHc using Alhydrogel (Sigma) adjuvant via the intramuscular route and subsequently challenged with 20,000 LD50 of neurotoxin serotype F. A dose response was observed in both the antibody titer and the protective efficacy with increasing dosage of FHc and number of vaccinations. Mice that received one injection of 5 microg or two injections of >or=0.04 microg of FHc were completely protected. These findings suggest that the recombinant FHc expressed in E. coli is efficacious in protecting mice against challenge with BoNT/F and that the recombinant FHc subunit vaccine may be useful in humans.
TI  - RhoA GTPase and F-actin dynamically regulate the permeability of Cx43-made channels in rat cardiac myocytes.
AB  - Gap junctions are clusters of transmembrane channels allowing a passive diffusion of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Connexin43, the main channel-forming protein expressed in ventricular myocytes, can associate with zonula occludens-1, a scaffolding protein linked to the actin cytoskeleton and to signal transduction molecules. The possible influence of Rho GTPases, major regulators of cellular junctions and of the actin cytoskeleton, in the modulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) was examined. The activation of RhoA by cytoxic necrotizing factor 1 markedly enhanced GJIC, whereas its specific inhibition by the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme significantly reduced it. RhoA activity affects GJIC without major cellular redistribution of junctional plaques or changes in the Cx43 phosphorylation pattern. As these GTPases frequently act via the cortical cytoskeleton, the importance of F-actin in the modulation of GJIC was investigated by means of agents interfering with actin polymerization. Cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin slowed down the kinetics of channel rundown in the absence of ATP, whereas its disruption by cytochalasin D rapidly and markedly reduced GJIC despite ATP presence. Cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin markedly reduced the consequences of RhoA activation or inactivation. This mechanism appears to be the first described capable to both up- or down-regulate GJIC through RhoA activation or, conversely, inhibition. The inhibition of Rho downstream kinase effectors had no effect on GJIC. The present results provide further insight into the gating and regulation of junctional channels and identify a new downstream target for the small G-protein RhoA.
TI  - Analysis of Rho-GTPase mimicry by a family of bacterial type III effector proteins.
AB  - Microbial pathogens may hijack the actin cytoskeleton machinery to facilitate actin-based motility, cellular invasion, and intracellular trafficking through the endocytic pathway. Of particular interest has been a large class of virulence factors collectively termed the type III "effector" proteins. Following contact with a eukaryotic cell, Gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ a dedicated protein secretion apparatus termed type III to translocate effector proteins into the cellular cytoplasm where they initiate a pathogenic response. Interestingly, these effectors can mimic the structure or function of eukaryotic signaling proteins and often target components of the actin cytoskeleton. This chapter describes methodologies to examine the cellular role of the recently defined WxxxE family of effector proteins that functionally mimic Rho family small G proteins.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the HA3 component of Clostridium botulinum type C progenitor toxin.
AB  - HA3, a 70 kDa haemagglutinating protein, is a precursor form of HA3a and HA3b, the subcomponents of Clostridium botulinum type C 16S progenitor toxin. In this report, recombinant HA3 protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 2.6 A resolution and the crystal belonged to the hexagonal space group P6(3). Matthews coefficient and self-rotation function calculations indicate that there is probably one molecule of HA3 in the asymmetric unit. A search for heavy-atom derivatives has been undertaken.
TI  - High-level expression of the Hcc domain of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A in Escherichia coli and its immunogenicity as an antigen.
AB  - A completely synthetic gene encoding the He domain of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (AHc, 1287 bp, 429 aa, -50 kD) was constructed with oligonucleotides. After expressed in Escherichia coli, soluble product AHc was gained and verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The expressive level of recombinant AHc in E. coli was very high (36%-53% of soluble total proteins) and the purified yield was more than 30 mg/L by one-step purification. Then, the purified AHc was used to vaccinate Balb/c mice, which developed a strong and specific immune response as expected following administration of AHe protein via the subcutaneous route. Results from BoNT/A neutralization assay showed that the serum from mice vaccinated with AHc contained high titer protective antibody. These results showed that the soluble, stable and high-levelly expressive AHc not only could be produced by the prokaryotic expression system built in our lab, but also owned strong immunogenicity to prepare antitoxin for treatment and as sub-unit candidate vaccine for prophylaxis against botulinum toxin serotype A.
TI  - Sterilization efficiency of a cascaded dielectric barrier discharge.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the microbial inactivation efficiency of a newly developed cascaded dielectric barrier discharge (CDBD) set-up against various micro-organisms on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foils. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inactivation kinetics in dependency of time were produced with air as process gas and test strains like Salmonella serotype Mons, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and spores of Bacillus atrophaeus, Aspergillus niger and Clostridium botulinum, which were homogeneously distributed on the sample surface by a spray method. Highest count reduction was observed for the vegetative cells with at least 6.6 log(10) within 1 s. Aspergillus niger was the most resistant test strain with an inactivation rate of about 5 log(10) in 5 s. CONCLUSIONS: For industrial applications it is necessary to evaluate new sterilization methods against a broad range of different micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: CDBD plasma is a fast and effective technology for decontamination of heat sensitive materials in few seconds.
TI  - C terminal half fragment (50 kDa) of heavy chain components of Clostridium botulinum type C and D neurotoxins can be used as an effective vaccine.
AB  - Recombinant whole heavy chains (H, 100 kDa) and their N-terminal (Hn, 50 kDa) and C-terminal (Hc, 50 kDa) half fragments of Clostridium botulinum type C and D neurotoxins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. GST eliminated-preparations of H (10 microg), Hn (5 microg), Hc (5 microg), or a mixture of Hn (5 microg) and Hc (5 microg) of types C and D were mixed with an equal volume of adjuvant, and then were twice injected into mice subcutaneously. After immunization, the mice were challenged with up to 10(6) the minimum lethal doses (MLD)/0.5 ml of C or D toxin, the type of which was same as that of the immunogens. All of the mice immunized with antigens except for Hn survived against 10(5) to 10(6) MLD/0.5 ml of the toxins, but the mice immunized with Hn were killed by 100 MLD/0.5 ml. The mice immunized with a mixture of C-Hc and D-Hc, each 5 microg, also showed a high level of resistance against both C and D toxins. Antibody levels immunized with GST fused-or GST eliminatedpreparation were quite similar. These results indicate that recombinant GST-fused Hc can be used as a safe and effective vaccine for type C and D botulism in animals. It also became clear that one time inoculation with a large amount of C-Hc or D-Hc, 100 microg, is useful for vaccine trials in mice.
TI  - [Foodborne infections and intoxications in Poland in 2004].
AB  - A total of 19 870 bacterial foodborne infections and intoxications were registered in 2004 (incidence 52.0/100,000 population). These illnesses were less incident in 2004, compared both to 2003 figure (20 221 cases) and the median 1998-2002 (26 734 cases). Unlike bacterial infections, the incidence of viral foodborne infections increased in the recent years (2004 - 27.2 vs. 2003 -21.1 and median 1998-2002 - 10.0). The parasitic foodborne infections did not change much during the recent years. A total of 156 cases of mushroom poisonings were reported (incidence 0,4) in 2004, compared to 78 cases in 2003, 66 cases in 2002 and a median of 223 cases in 1998-2001 (incidence 0.6). There were 13 deaths related to foodborne infections or intoxications registered in 2004, of which the following etiologic agents were established: Salmonella Enteritidis (2) Clostridium botulinum (2), Streptococcus aureus (1), other bacteria (6), and E. multilocularis infestation (2). A total of 347 foodborne and waterborne outbreaks involving 5 920 cases were reported in 2004 (only outbreaks involving 4 persons or more). The most prevalent etiological factors in outbreaks were Salmonella strains (50.0% of cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5% of cases) and Escherichia coli (4.6% of cases). In 28% of outbreaks involving 31.2% cases no etiological factor was established. The most prevalent Salmonella strain were S. Enteritidis (95,1% cases) and S. Typhimurium (1.7%). The main vehicle of foodborne and waterborne outbreaks were meals prepared from various (>2) raw materials of animal sources (33.1% of cases) and meals from eggs (20.3%). Of the places of food contamination, the most prevalent were own apartments (24.8% of outbreaks), food producing farms (8,1%), and restaurants (8,1%). The three largest outbreaks (two caused by S. Enteritidis and one by S. aureus) involved 576 cases, of which 26 were hospitalized.
TI  - Use of microbial antagonism to reduce pathogen levels on produce and meat products: a review.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are often utilized to control food-borne pathogens on  produce and on cooked, fermented, or refrigerated meats. Most research to date has focused on the inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Clostridium botulinum, and spoilage microorganisms. LAB are excellent candidates for reducing pathogen levels on foods because they inhibit the growth of these microorganisms through various mechanisms without causing unacceptable sensory changes. This review provides an up-to-date look at research directed at maximizing the use of LAB by selecting the most appropriate strains, by learning how to apply them to foods most effectively, and by gaining an understanding of the mechanism by which they inhibit pathogens.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of biologically active recombinant hemagglutinin-33, type A botulinum neurotoxin associated protein.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin type A, the most toxic substance known to mankind, is produced by Clostridiurn botulinum type A as a complex with a group of neurotoxin-associated proteins (NAPs) through polycistronic expression of a clustered group of genes. Hemagglutinin-33 (Hn-33) is a 33 kDa subcomponent of NAPs, which is resistant to protease digestion, a feature likely to be involved in the protection of the botulinum neurotoxin from proteolysis. In order to fully understand the function of Hn-33, large amounts of Hn-33 will be needed without dealing with biosafety risks to grow large cultures of C. botulinum. There are difficulties to clone the genes with the high A + T contents produced by C. botulinum. We report here for the first time using the Gateway technology to clone functional Hn-33 that has been expressed in E. coli. The yield of the recombinant Hn-33 was about 12 mg per liter of E. coli culture. The recombinant Hn-33 folds well in aqueous solution as shown with circular dichroism spectra, resists temperature-denaturation, is totally resistant to trypsin proteolysis despite the presence of cleavage sites on the molecular surface, and maintains its biological activities comparable to the native Hn-33 hemagglutination.
TI  - Unique substrate recognition by botulinum neurotoxins serotypes A and E.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are zinc proteases that cleave SNARE proteins to elicit flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the fusion of neurotransmitter-carrying vesicles to the plasma membrane of peripheral neurons. There are seven serotypes of BoNT, termed A-G. BoNT serotype A and serotype E cleave SNAP25 at residues 197-198 and 180-181, respectively. Unlike other zinc proteases, the BoNTs recognize extended regions of SNAP25 for cleavage. The basis for this extended substrate recognition and specificity is unclear. Saturation mutagenesis and deletion mapping identified residues 156-202 of SNAP25 as the optimal cleavage domain for BoNT/A, whereas the optimal cleavage domain for BoNT/E was shorter, comprising residues 167-186 of SNAP25. Two sub-sites were resolved within each optimal cleavage domain, which included a recognition or active site (AS) domain that contained the site of cleavage and a binding (B) domain, which contributed to substrate affinity. Within the AS domains, the P1', P3, and P5 sites of SNAP25 contributed to scissile bond cleavage by LC/A, whereas the P1' and P2 sites of SNAP25 contributed to scissile bond cleavage by LC/E. These studies provide insight into the development of strategies for small molecule inhibitors of the BoNTs.
TI  - Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of neurotoxin gene from an environmental isolate of Clostridium sp.: comparison with other clostridial neurotoxins.
AB  - A Clostridium sp. isolated from intestine of decaying fish exhibited 99% sequence identity with C. tetani at 16S rRNA level. It produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized by botulinum antitoxin (A+B+E) as well as tetanus antitoxin. The gene fragments for light chain, C-terminal and N-terminal regions of the heavy chain of the toxin were amplified using three reported primer sets for tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). The neurotoxin gene fragments were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The sequences obtained exhibited approximately 98, 99 and 98% sequence identity with reported gene sequences of TeNT/LC, TeNT/HC and TeNT/HN, respectively. The phylogenetic interrelationship between the neurotoxin gene of Clostridium sp. with previously reported gene sequences of Clostridium botulinum A to G and C. tetani was examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences. Six amino acids were substituted at four different positions in the light chain of neurotoxin from the isolate when compared with the reported closest sequence of TeNT. Of these, four were located in the beta15 motif at a solvent inaccessible, buried region of the protein molecule. One of these substitutions were on the solvent accessible surface residue of alpha1 motif, previously shown to have strong sequence conservation. A substitution of two amino acids observed in N-terminal region of heavy chain were buried residues, located in the beta21 and beta37 motifs showing variability in other related sequences. The C-terminal region responsible for binding to receptor was conserved, showing no changes in the amino acid sequence.
TI  - Fluorescent assay of cell-permeable C3 transferase activity.
AB  - C3 transferase has been extensively used in the investigation of Rho signaling. It acts as a Rho antagonist by covalently attaching an ADP-ribose group to RhoA, B, and C proteins. Cell-permeable C3 fusion proteins have been developed so that lower doses of C3 can be used. We describe a simple and fast fluorescence-based assay to evaluate the enzymatic activity of cell-permeable C3 proteins purified from Escherichia coli. The assay measures glycohydrolase (GH) activity of C3 that cleaves NAD+ into ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Results from the GH activity correlate with other tests carried out in tissue culture cells such as neurite outgrowth or ADP ribosylation of RhoA. This method provides reliable measurements of the activity of permeable C3 proteins or other C3-related proteins.
TI  - Exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 turns  the asparagine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by Clostridium species, Bacillus cereus, and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. The exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass GTPases RhoA, B, and C. In structural studies of C3-like exoenzymes, an ARTT-motif (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 95-107). Exchange of Gln217, which is a key residue of the ARTT-motif, to Glu in C3 from Clostridium limosum results in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward RhoA. The mutant protein is still capable of NAD-binding and possesses NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Whereas recombinant wild-type C3 modifies Rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (Asn41), Gln217Glu-C3 is capable of ADP-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, is modified by the Gln217Glu-C3 transferase. Also in C3 ADP-ribosyltransferases from Clostridium botulinum and B. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent Gln residue to Glu blocked asparagine modification of RhoA but elicited arginine-specific ADP-ribosylation. Moreover, the Gln217Glu-C3lim transferase was able to ADP-ribosylate recombinant wild-type C3lim at Arg86, resulting in decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. The data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the ARTT-motif turns the asparagine-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferases of the C3 family into arginine-ADP-ribosylating transferases.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Listeria monocytogenes and Aspergillus niger. Evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  - The evaluation of the microbiological charge present in Costa Rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. The microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in Costa Rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. Also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of Clostridium botulinum. For the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in Muller Hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger. The results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) CFU/g. No positive result was obtained for the isolation of C. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of S. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, A. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of Clostridium botulinum type B light chain.
AB  - A full-length synthetic gene encoding the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype B, approximately 50 kDa (BoNT/B LC), has been cloned into a bacterial expression vector pET24a+. BoNT/B LC was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21.DE3.pLysS and isolated from the soluble fraction. The resultant protein was purified to homogeneity by cation chromatography and was determined to be >98% pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with SilverXpress and analyzed by densitometry. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 50.8 kDa, which equaled the theoretically expected mass. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein showed the sequence corresponded to the known reported sequence. The recombinant BoNT/B light chain was found to be highly stable, catalytically active, and has been used to prepare antisera that neutralizes against BoNT/B challenge. Characterization of the protein including pH, temperature, and the stability of the protein in the presence or absence of zinc is described within. The influence of pH differences, buffer, and added zinc on secondary and tertiary structure of BoNT/B light chain was analyzed by circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Optimal conditions for obtaining maximum metalloprotease activity and stabilizing the protein for long term storage were determined. We further analyzed the thermal denaturation of BoNT/B LC as a function of temperature to probe the pH and added zinc effects on light chain stability. The synthetic BoNT/B LC has been found to be highly active on its substrate (vesicle associated membrane protein-2) and, therefore, can serve as a useful reagent for BoNT/B research.
TI  - Characterization of the antibody response to the receptor binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A and E.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic proteins for humans. The current clostridial-derived vaccines against BoNT intoxication have limitations including production and accessibility. Conditions were established to express the soluble receptor binding domain (heavy-chain receptor [HCR]) of BoNT serotypes A and E in Escherichia coli. Sera isolated from mice and rabbits immunized with recombinant HCR/A1 (rHCR/A1) from the classical type A-Hall strain (ATCC 3502) (BoNT/A1) and rHCR/E from BoNT serotype E Beluga (BoNT/E(B)) neutralized the homologous serotype of BoNT but displayed differences in cross-recognition and cross-protection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting showed that alpha-rHCR/A1 recognized epitopes within the C terminus of the HCR/A and HCR/E, while alpha-rHCR/E recognized epitopes within the N terminus or interface between the N and C termini of the HCR proteins. alpha-rHCR/E(B) sera possessed detectable neutralizing capacity for BoNT/A1, while alpha-rHCR/A1 did not neutralize BoNT/E. rHCR/A was an effective immunogen against BoNT/A1 and the Kyoto F infant strain (BoNT/A2), but not BoNT serotype E Alaska (BoNT/E(A)), while rHCR/E(B) neutralized BoNT/E(A), and under hyperimmunization conditions protected against BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2. The protection elicited by rHCR/A1 to BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 and by rHCR/E(B) to BoNT/E(A) indicate that immunization with receptor binding domains elicit protection within sub-serotypes of BoNT. The protection elicited by hyperimmunization with rHCR/E against BoNT/A suggests the presence of common neutralizing epitopes between the serotypes E and A. These results show that a receptor binding domain subunit vaccine protects against serotype variants of BoNTs.
TI  - [Modification and high level expression of protective antigen fragment of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A].
AB  - Designed a pair of primers through modifying N-terminal bases (5bps) of gene after ATG but not changing amino acid, and amplified a smaller mutated gene sequnce (468bp) containing two protective antigenic determinants from pBlue-BoNTaHc, N-terminal codon of mutated gene fragment is changed from low to high frenqence in E. coli. Mutated gene was ligated into pGEM-T vector and sequenced, then, cloned into a expression plasmid pBV220. As a result, cloned gene was expressed in insoluble form by temperature inducing (from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C) in E. coli. Expression product is 40% of total proteins and is of specific binding activity to antibody in ELISA. The successful modification and high level expression of protective fragment of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A(BoNTaHc468) gene is conducive to further study on antitoxin and vaccine.
TI  - Efficient production of Clostridium botulinum exotoxin C3 in bacteria: a screening method to optimize production yields.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 is responsible for the inactivation of members of the Rho GTPase family that are implicated in actin-cytoskeleton reorganization. This property has been extensively used in the field to investigate the functionality of the Rho GTPases. However, systematic analysis of Rho GTPase functions requires large amounts of such inhibitors and consequently an optimization of the production yield of these proteins. Bacterial production of soluble proteins often requires a refolding step that noticeably affects the production yields and necessitates additional experiments to verify functional activity. This is particularly true for TAT-C3, the production yields of which are generally low. In this report, we describe a rapid and efficient method for the production of soluble C3 exoenzyme developed by screening a collection of bacterial strains. The recombinant C3 protein was fused to the TAT protein-transduction domain from HIV, to allow protein delivery into cells, and to a hexahistidine tag, that permitted purification by Nickel affinity chromatography. We have demonstrated the production of large amounts of soluble and functional protein using the bacterial strain AD494 (DE3)pLysS. This rapid and efficient method for the production of soluble C3 exoenzyme could also be useful for the production of other proteins with solubility problems.
TI  - Transcription activation of a UV-inducible Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin gene by a novel sigma factor.
AB  - Expression of the plasmid-encoded Clostridium perfringens gene for bacteriocin BCN5 was shown to depend in vivo and in vitro on the activity of UviA protein. UviA, also plasmid-encoded, proved to be an RNA polymerase sigma factor and was also partly autoregulatory. The uviA gene has two promoters; one provided a UviA-independent, basal level of gene expression while the stronger, UviA-dependent promoter was only utilized after the cell experienced DNA damage. As a result, BCN5 synthesis is induced by treatment with UV light or mitomycin C. UviA is related to a special class of sigma factors found to date only in Clostridium species and responsible for activating transcription of toxin genes in Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum.
TI  - CNF and DNT.
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells is involved in many processes that affect the growth and colonization of bacteria, such as migration of immune cells, phagocytosis by macrophages, secretion of cytokines, maintenance of epithelial barrier functions and others. With respect to these functions, it is not surprising that many bacterial protein toxins, which are important virulence factors and causative agents of human and/or animal diseases, target the actin cytoskeleton of the host. Some toxins target actin directly, such as the C2 toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Moreover, bacterial toxins target the cytoskeleton indirectly by modifying actin regulators such as the low-molecular-mass guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins of the Rho family. Remarkably, toxins affect these GTPases in a bidirectional manner. Some toxins inhibit and some activate the GTPases. Here we review the Rho-activating toxins CNF1 and CNF2 (cytotoxic necrotizing factors) from Escherichia coli, the Yersinia CNF(Y) and the dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) from Bordetella species. We describe and compare their uptake into mammalian cells, mode of action, structure-function relationship, substrate specificity and role in diseases.
TI  - Femtomolar sensitivity of a NO sensor from Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is extremely toxic to Clostridium botulinum, but its molecular  targets are unknown. Here, we identify a heme protein sensor (SONO) that displays femtomolar affinity for NO. The crystal structure of the SONO heme domain reveals a previously undescribed fold and a strategically placed tyrosine residue that modulates heme-nitrosyl coordination. Furthermore, the domain architecture of a SONO ortholog cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii indicates that NO signaling through cyclic guanosine monophosphate arose before the origin of multicellular eukaryotes. Our findings have broad implications for understanding bacterial responses to NO, as well as for the activation of mammalian NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase.
TI  - Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  - Comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. This process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial DNA. Many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. Two situations can be distinguished: Vibrio cholerae, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. These prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. Prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile DNA elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. Prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. In many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific DNA sequences. In addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. The current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.
TI  - The C-terminus of botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain contributes to solubility, catalysis, and stability.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is the etiological agent responsible for botulism, a disease characterized by peripheral neuromuscular blockade. BoNT/A is produced by Clostridium botulinum as a single chain protein that is activated by proteolytic cleavage to form a 50 kDa light chain (LC, 448 amino acids) and a disulfide bond-linked 100 kDa heavy chain (HC, 847 amino acids). Whilst HC comprises the receptor binding and translocation domains, LC is a Zn2+-endopeptidase that cleaves at a single glutaminyl-arginine bond corresponding to residues 197 and 198 at the C-terminus of SNAP25. Cleavage of SNAP25 uncouples the neural exocytosis docking/fusion machinery. LC/A (LC 1-448) and several C-terminal deletion proteins of LC/A were engineered and expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. LC 1-448 was purified, but precipitated upon storage. Approximately 40% of LC 1-448 was a covalent dimer due to the formation of inter-chain disulfide bond formation at Cys430. Conversion of Cys430 to Ser abolished dimer formation of LC 1-448, but did not improve solubility. Three C-terminal deletion peptides were engineered; LC 1-425 and LC 1-418 were expressed and could be purified as soluble and stable proteins, whilst LC 1-398 was soluble, but not stable to storage. Kinetic studies showed that LC 1-448 and LC 1-425 efficiently cleaved GST-SNAP25 and the fluorescent substrate SNAPtide, while LC 1-418 catalyzed the cleavage of both the SNAP25 and the fluorescent substrate SNAPtide with a similar Km, but at a 10-fold slower kcat. Thus, regions within the C-terminus of LC/A contribute to solubility, stability, and catalysis.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Vaccination with recombinant whole heavy chain fragments of Clostridium botulinum Type C and D neurotoxins.
AB  - Mice and ducks were subcutaneously immunized with recombinant whole heavy (H) chains of Clostridium botulinum type C and D neurotoxins, which were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. In the case of mice, it was confirmed that two immunizations with type C- and D-H chains, 10 microg each time, significantly increased the specific antibodies against 100-kDa H chains of type C and D neurotoxins in an immunoblot analysis and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The mice immunized with type C- and D-H chains showed no symptoms of botulism when they were challenged with C- and D-16 S toxins at doses, given intraperitoneally, of up to 10(5) and 10(6) minmum lethal doses (MLD), respectively, per mouse. Ducks were immunized with a total of 100 microg of type C-H chain. The ducks also developed specific antibodies to the type C-H chain and showed significant protection against a challenge with 10(3) duck MLD of C-16 S toxin given intravenously. These results indicate that recombinant whole H chains can be used as an effective and safe vaccine for type C and D botulism in domestic animals.
TI  - Retargeted clostridial endopeptidases: inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmitter release in vitro, and antinociceptive activity in in vivo models of pain.
AB  - Clostridial neurotoxins potently and specifically inhibit neurotransmitter release in defined cell types. Previously reported data have demonstrated that the catalytically active LH(N) endopeptidase fragment of botulinum neurotoxin type A (termed LH(N)/A) can be retargeted to a range of cell types in vitro to lead to inhibition of secretion of a range of transmitters. Here, we report the synthesis of endopeptidase conjugates with in vitro selectivity for nociceptive afferents compared to spinal neurons. Chemical conjugates prepared between Erythrina cristagalli lectin and LH(N)/A are assessed in vitro and in in vivo models of pain. Chemical conjugates prepared between E. cristagalli lectin and either natively sourced LH(N)/A, or recombinant LH(N)/A purified from Escherichia coli are assessed, and equivalence of the recombinant material is demonstrated. The duration of action of inhibition of neurotransmitter release by the conjugate in vitro is also assessed and is comparable to that observed with Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin. Selectivity of targeting and therapeutic potential have been confirmed by in vivo electrophysiology studies. Furthermore, the analgesic properties of the conjugate have been assessed in in vivo models of pain and extended duration effects observed. These data provide proof of principle for the concept of retargeted clostridial endopeptidases as novel analgesics.
TI  - Cloning, high level expression, purification, and crystallization of the full length Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type E light chain.
AB  - The catalytic activity of the highly potent botulinum neurotoxins are confined to their N-terminal light chains ( approximately 50kDa). A full-length light chain for the type E neurotoxin with a C-terminal 6x His-tag, BoNT/E-LC, has been cloned in a pET-9c vector and over-expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. BoNT/E-LC was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose followed by exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-75 sizing column. The purified protein has very good solubility and can be stored stably at -20 degrees C; however, it seems to undergo auto-proteolysis when stored at temperature #10878;4-10 degrees C. BoNT/E-LC is active on its natural substrate, the synaptosomal associated 25kDa protein, SNAP-25, indicating that it retains a native-like conformation and therefore can be considered as a useful tool in studying the structure/function of the catalytic light chain. Recombinant BoNT/E-LC has been crystallized under five different conditions and at various pHs. Crystals diffract to better than 2.1A.
TI  - Cloning, high-level expression, single-step purification, and binding activity of His6-tagged recombinant type B botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain transmembrane and binding domain.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses and associate with infant botulism. BoNT is a approximately 150kDa protein, consisting of a binding/translocating heavy chain (HC; 100kDa) and a toxifying light chain (LC; 50kDa) linked through a disulfide bond. C-terminal half of the heavy chain is binding domain, and N-terminal half of the heavy chain is translocation domain that includes transmembrane domain. A functional botulinum neurotoxin type B heavy chain transmembrane and binding domain (Ile 624-Glu 1291) has been cloned into a bacterial expression vector pET 15b and produced as an N-terminally six-histidine-tagged fusion protein (BoNT/B HC TBD). (His(6))-BoNT/B HC TBD was highly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL and isolated from the E. coli inclusion bodies. After solubilizing the purified inclusion bodies with 6M guanidine-HCl in the presence of 10mM beta-mercaptoethanol, the protein was purified and refolded in a single step on Ni(2+) affinity column by removing beta-mercaptoethanol first, followed by the removal of urea. The purified protein was determined to be 98% pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. (His(6))-BoNT/B HC TBD retained binding to synaptotagmin II, the receptor of BoNT/B, which was confirmed by immunological dot blot assay, also to ganglioside, which was investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Mechanism of C2-toxin inhibition by fluphenazine and related compounds: investigation of their binding kinetics to the C2II-channel using the current noise analysis.
AB  - The binding component C2II of the binary actin ADP-ribosylating C2-toxin from Clostridium botulinum is essential for intoxication of target cells. Activation by a protease leads to channel formation and this is presumably required for the transport of the toxic C2I component into cells. The C2II-channel is cation selective and contains a binding site for fluphenazine and structurally related compounds. Ion transport through C2II and in vivo intoxication is blocked when the sites are occupied by the ligands. C2II was reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer membranes and formed ion permeable channels. The binding constant of chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine, chloropromazine and fluphenazine to the C2II-channel was determined using titration experiments, which resulted in its block. The ligand-induced current noise of the C2II-channels was investigated using fast Fourier transformation. The noise of the open channels had a rather small spectral density, which was a function of the inverse frequency up to about 100 Hz. Upon addition of ligands to the aqueous phase the current through C2II decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, the spectral density of the current noise increased drastically and its frequency dependence was of Lorentzian type, which was caused by the on and off-reactions of the ligand-mediated channel block. The ligand-induced current noise of C2II was used for the evaluation of the binding kinetics for different ligands to the channel. The on-rate constant of ligand binding was between 10(7) and 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and was dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. The off-rate varied between about 10 s(-1) and 3900 s(-1) and depended on the structure of the ligand. The role of structural requirements for the effective block of C2II by the different ligands is discussed.
TI  - Enteric illness in Ontario, Canada, from 1997 to 2001.
AB  - Enteric illness is a common problem worldwide. In Ontario (population of 11.4 million, 2001 Census of Canada), laboratory-confirmed cases of "reportable" enteric diseases are reported to local health units. Public health staff members investigate these illnesses and subsequently report details to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care through an electronic reporting system. From 1997 to 2001, 44,451 sporadic cases of illness attributable to eight enteric pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Yersinia, Shigella, hepatitis A, Listeria, and Clostridium botulinum) were reported. This number was less than the 56,690 cases reported from 1992 to 1996. Campylobacter accounted for the highest annual average incidence rate at 42.3 cases per 100,000 persons, with Salmonella following at 22.6, verotoxin-producing E. coli at 3.7, Yersinia at 3.0, Shigella at 2.7, hepatitis A at 2.3, and Listeria at 0.3. The 4 months from June to September accounted for almost half (46.5%) of all cases. For 74.0% of the outbreaks associated with these eight enteric pathogens, foodborne contamination was identified as the mode of transmission. Poultry and other meat items accounted for 68.4% of the food items when food was identified as the vehicle. Admittedly, the "foods" and "modes of transmission" identified may have been subject to investigator bias based on previous knowledge. The most common risk setting, which was reported in approximately half of the cases, was private homes; travel-associated illness and restaurants were the second and third most frequently reported risk settings at 24.6 and 14.1%, respectively. Findings from this study suggest that public health efforts should be directed toward safe food handling in the home during the summer months.
TI  - Molecular characterization of GroES and GroEL homologues from Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - We report novel findings of significant amounts of 60- and 10-kDa proteins on SDS-PAGE in a culture supernatant of the Clostridium botulinum type D strain 4947 (D-4947). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified proteins were closely related to those of other bacterial GroEL and GroES proteins, and both positively cross-reacted with Escherichia coli GroEL and GroES antibodies. Native GroEL homologue as an oligomeric complex is a weak ATPase whose activity is inhibited by the presence of GroES homologue. The 2634-bp groESL operon of D-4947 was isolated by PCR and sequenced. The sequence included two complete open reading frames (282 and 1629 bp), which were homologous to the groES and groEL gene family of bacterial proteins. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicate that the groESL operon is encoded on the genomic DNA of D-4947 as a single copy, and not on that of its specific toxin-converting phage.
TI  - Channel formation by the binding component of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin: glutamate 307 of C2II affects channel properties in vitro and pH-dependent C2I translocation in vivo.
AB  - The binding component (C2II) of the binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin mediates transport of the actin ADP-ribosylating enzyme component (C2I) into the cytosol of target cells. C2II (80 kDa) is activated by trypsin cleavage, and proteolytically activated C2II (60 kDa) oligomerizes to heptamers in solution. Activated C2II forms channels in lipid bilayer membranes which are highly cation selective and voltage-gated. A role for this channel in C2I translocation across the cell membrane into the cytosol is discussed. Amino acid residues 303-331 of C2II contain a conserved pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, which likely facilitates membrane insertion and channel formation by creating two antiparallel beta-strands. Some of the residues are in strategic positions within the putative C2II channel, in particular, glutamate 307 (E307) localized in its center and glycine 316 (G316) localized on the trans side of the membrane. Here, single-lysine substitutions of these amino acids and the double mutant E307K/G316K of C2II were analyzed in vivo and in artificial lipid bilayer experiments. The pH dependence of C2I transport across cellular membranes was altered, and a pH of <or=5.2 was needed for C2I translocation into target cells; otherwise, no change in C2II-promoted entry of C2I into Vero cells was observed. The channel properties of C2II were substantially changed by the mutations, as evidenced by reduced cation selectivity. Interestingly, the voltage dependence of wild-type C2II was completely lost for the E307K mutant, which means that E307 is responsible for voltage gating. Chloroquine blocked the E307K mutant channel and intoxication of Vero cells by mutant C2II and C2I, indicating that chloroquine binding does not involve E307. Overall, the voltage gating and cation selectivity of the C2II channel do not play an important role in translocation of C2I into the cytosol.
TI  - Expression of HC subunits from Clostridium botulinum types C and D and their evaluation as candidate vaccine antigens in mice.
AB  - Two proteins representing the heavy-chain subunits of botulinum neurotoxin types  C and D were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their vaccine potential was evaluated. Mice were vaccinated with doses ranging from 0.5 to 10 microg and were challenged with 10 to 10(5) 50% lethal doses of toxin. For the type C subunit protein, C50, two doses of 2 microg were required for full protection, while, for type D subunit protein, D50, two 1- microg doses were required. A bivalent vaccine consisting of a mixture of these two proteins also provided protection against both botulinum neurotoxin type C and type D challenge. Antibody levels in serum were determined by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and serum neutralization assays
TI  - Purification and characterization of brochocin A and brochocin B(10-43), a functional fragment generated by heterologous expression in Carnobacterium piscicola.
AB  - Brochothrix campestris ATCC 43754 produces a heat-stable, two-component, nonlantibiotic, class IIb bacteriocin, brochocin C (BrcC), that is active against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including spores of Clostridium botulinum. An improved purification method was developed for BrcC, in which n-butanol and chloroform extraction are used. Mass spectral characterization of the two components, brochocin A (BrcA) and brochocin B (BrcB), showed that both components are excreted into the medium by B. campestris as mature peptides consisting of 59 and 43 amino acids, respectively. Separate expression clones of BrcA and BrcB were constructed previously in Carnobacterium piscicola LV17C, but the products were not chemically characterized. Purification by the new protocol showed that BrcA is expressed as the mature 59-amino-acid peptide but that BrcB is produced by C. piscicola as a fragment, BrcB(10-43), which is cleaved at an internal Gly-Gly site. This fragment is not antimicrobial by itself, but in combination with BrcA it displays the full activity of the BrcC complex. Circular dichroism measurements revealed a high beta-sheet content in the secondary structure of both BrcA and BrcB(10-43), as well as in a 1:1 BrcA-BrcB(10-43) mixture. Separate expression clones of brcA and brcB were also constructed in Escherichia coli, but these clones only produced multiple fragments of the desired peptides with little or no activity.
TI  - Sequence of the gene for Clostridium botulinum type B neurotoxin associated with  infant botulism, expression of the C-terminal half of heavy chain and its binding activity.
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that the neurotoxin of strain 111 (111/NT) associated with type B infant botulism showed antigenic and biological properties different from that (Okra/NT) produced by a foodborne botulism-related strain, Okra. In this study, the neurotoxin genes of 111/NT and Okra/NT were amplified and the sequences determined. The nucleotide sequences of the genes for both neurotoxins possessed an open reading frame of 3873 bp that encoded 1291 amino acids. The identities of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were 97.6% and 95.7%, respectively. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was 0.47. The amino acid substitutions between 111/NT and Okra/NT occurred mainly in the domain of the C-terminal half of heavy chain (H(C)) responsible for binding to its receptor complex of protein and ganglioside. To characterize the binding capability of the H(C), recombinant genes for the H(C) and two hybrid H(C) in which one half of Okra/NT was replaced by the homologous half of 111/NT were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding activity of the recombinant H(C) of 111/NT to the protein receptor synaptotagmin II, in the presence of ganglioside GT1b, was 4.2-fold less than Okra/NT, consistent with the corresponding two NTs. The use of hybrid H(C) revealed that mutation of 23 residues in carboxy terminal half of H(C) (1029-1291) of Okra/NT could be attributed to the lower binding activity of 111/NT and thus the differences in binding affinity between the two BoNT/B.
TI  - Mucosal immunisation with Clostridium botulinum type C 16 S toxoid and its non-toxic component.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum types C and D produce a 16 S (500 kDa) toxin that is formed by conjugation of neurotoxin with a non-toxic component (nonTox). The amino acid sequences of type C and D nonTox components are almost identical. In a previous report it was proposed that nonTox is necessary for the effective absorption of the toxin from the small intestine. This suggested the hypothesis that mucosal immunity against nonTox in the small intestine might prevent the absorption of both C- and D-16 S toxins. The nonTox was purified from a mutant strain, (C)-N71, that does not produce neurotoxin. This nonTox or detoxified C-16 S toxin were mixed with adjuvant (a mutant form of heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli), and inoculated into mice via the nasal or oral route, or both. The mice inoculated nasally four times with nonTox or toxoid produced high levels of antibodies (including IgA) against the immunogens, both in intestinal fluids and sera. When these nonTox-immunised mice were challenged orally with 2 and 20 oral minimum lethal doses (MLD) of C- or D-16 S toxins, the same results were obtained with both C and D; the mice survived after challenge with 2 MLD of either C or D but were killed by 20 MLD of either toxin although the time to death was significantly longer than in the control non-immunised mice. These results indicate that the local anti-nonTox antibodies reduce absorption of both C- and D-16 S toxins from the small intestine. The C-16 S toxoid-immunised mice showed similar behaviour with type D toxin challenge, probably due to the same mechanism, but were protected against 20 MLD of C-16 S toxin.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Mapping of the Ia domain involved in docking  with Ib and cellular internalization.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens iota toxin consists of two unlinked proteins. The binding component (Ib) is required to internalize into cells an enzymatic component (Ia) that ADP-ribosylates G-actin. To characterize the Ia domain that interacts with Ib, fusion proteins were constructed between the C. botulinum C3 enzyme, which ADP-ribosylates Rho, and various truncated versions of Ia. These chimeric molecules retained the wild type ADP-ribosyltransferase activity specific for Rho and were recognized by antibodies against C3 enzyme and Ia. Internalization of each chimera into Vero cells was assessed by measuring the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Fusion proteins containing C3 linked to the C terminus of Ia were transported most efficiently into cells like wild type Ia in an Ib-dependent manner that was blocked by bafilomycin A1. The minimal Ia fragment that promoted translocation of Ia-C3 chimeras into cells consisted of 128 central residues (129-257). These findings revealed that iota toxin is a suitable system for mediating the entry of heterologous proteins such as C3 into cells.
TI  - Leukotriene D(4) induces stress-fibre formation in intestinal epithelial cells via activation of RhoA and PKCdelta.
AB  - The intestinal epithelial barrier, which is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton,  exhibits permeability changes during inflammation. Here we show that activation of the CysLT(1) receptor by the inflammatory mediator leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)) causes a rapid increase in stress-fibre formation in intestinal epithelial cells. This effect was mimicked by cytotoxic necrotising factor-1 (CNF-1)-induced activation of RhoA, overexpression of constitutively active RhoA (L63-RhoA) and phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In accordance, inhibition of RhoA, by C3 exoenzyme or by dominant-negative RhoA (N19-RhoA), as well as GF109203X-induced inhibition of PKC, suppressed the LTD(4)-induced stress-fibre formation. Introduction of the dominant-negative regulatory domain of PKCdelta, but not the corresponding structures from PKCalpha, betaII or epsilon, blocked the LTD(4)-induced stress-fibre formation. Evaluating the relationship between PKCdelta and RhoA in LTD(4)-induced stress-fibre formation, we found that C3 exoenzyme inhibited the rapid LTD(4)-elicited translocation of PKCdelta to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, CNF-1-induced stress-fibre formation was blocked by GF109203X and by overexpression of the regulatory domain of PKC-delta, whereas PKC-induced stress-fibre production was not affected by N19-RhoA. We conclude that PKC-delta is located downstream of RhoA and that active RhoA and PKCdelta are both necessary for LTD(4)-induced stress-fibre formation.
TI  - Expression and purification of catalytically active, non-toxic endopeptidase derivatives of Clostridium botulinum toxin type A.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A is a potently toxic protein of 150 kDa with specific endopeptidase activity for the SNARE protein SNAP-25. Proteolytic cleavage of BoNT/A with trypsin leads to removal of the C-terminal domain responsible for neuronal cell binding. Removal of this domain result in a catalytically active, non-cell-binding derivative termed LH(N)/A. We have developed a purification scheme to prepare LH(N)/A essentially free of contaminating BoNT/A. LH(N)/A prepared by this scheme retains full enzymatic activity, is stable in solution, and is of low toxicity as demonstrated in a mouse toxicity assay. In addition, LH(N)/A has minimal effect on release of neurotransmitter from a primary cell culture model. Both the mouse bioassay and in vitro release assay suggest BoNT/A is present at less than 1 in 10(6) molecules of LH(N)/A. This represents a significant improvement on previously reported figures for LH(N)/A, and also the light chain domain, previously purified from BoNT/A. To complement the preparation of LH(N)/A from holotoxin, DNA encoding LH(N)/A has been introduced into Escherichia coli to facilitate expression of recombinant product. Expression and purification parameters have been developed to enable isolation of soluble, stable endopeptidase with a toxicity profile enhanced on that of LH(N)/A purified from BoNT/A. The recombinant-derived material has been used to prepare antisera that neutralise a BoNT/A challenge. The production of essentially BoNT/A-free LH(N)/A by two different methods and the possibilities for exploitation are discussed.
TI  - Inhibition of release of neurotransmitters from rat dorsal root ganglia by a novel conjugate of a Clostridium botulinum toxin A endopeptidase fragment and Erythrina cristagalli lectin.
AB  - Clostridial neurotoxins potently and specifically inhibit neurotransmitter release in defined cell types. Here we report that a catalytically active derivative (termed LH(N)/A) of the type A neurotoxin from Clostridium botulinum has been coupled to a lectin obtained from Erythrina cristagalli to form a novel conjugate. This conjugate exhibits an in vitro selectivity for nociceptive afferents compared with the anatomically adjacent spinal neurons, as assessed using in vitro primary neuronal culture systems to measure inhibition of release of neurotransmitters. Chemical conjugates prepared between E. cristagalli lectin and either natively sourced LH(N)/A or recombinant LH(N)/A purified from Escherichia coli are assessed, and equivalence of the recombinant material are demonstrated. Furthermore, the dependence of inhibition of neurotransmitter release on the cleavage of SNAP-25 is demonstrated through the use of an endopeptidase-deficient LH(N)/A conjugate variant. The duration of action of inhibition of neurotransmitter released by the conjugate in vitro is assessed and is comparable with that observed with Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin. Finally, in vivo electrophysiology shows that these in vitro actions have biological relevance in that sensory transmission from nociceptive afferents through the spinal cord is significantly attenuated. These data demonstrate that the potent endopeptidase activity of clostridial neurotoxins can be selectively retargeted to cells of interest and that inhibition of release of neurotransmitters from a neuronal population of therapeutic relevance to the treatment of pain can be achieved.
TI  - Endothelial Rho signaling is required for monocyte transendothelial migration.
AB  - Bacterial toxins affecting Rho activity in microvascular endothelial cells were employed to elucidate whether endothelial Rho participates in regulating the migration of monocytes across monolayers of cultured endothelial cells. Inactivation of Rho by the Clostridium C3 exoenzyme resulted in an increased adhesion of peripheral blood monocytes to the endothelium and a decreased rate of transendothelial monocyte migration. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1-mediated activation of endothelial Rho also reduced the rate of monocyte transmigration, but did not affect monocyte-endothelium adhesion. Thus, efficient leukocyte extravasation requires Rho signaling not only within the migrating leukocytes but also within the endothelial lining of the vessel wall.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of foodborne Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. against Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The saprophytic Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. Culture supernatants of 200 strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against C. botulinum type A, proteolytic type B, and type E strains in a well diffusion assay. Nineteen strains were positive against C. botulinum. Among those, seven Paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against C. botulinum strains. The antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive P. polymyxa strains. The antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees C and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees C in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In co-cultures with the positive strain of P. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a C. botulinum type E strain was inhibited whenever P. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before C. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. The antimicrobial activity of P. polymyxa against C. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. Other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587.
AB  - All publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 in order to reveal the capability of microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. Among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cphA were found in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (encoding a protein homologous to CphA with 40% amino acid identity), Bordetella bronchiseptica strain RB50 (39%), Bordetella pertussis strain Tohama I (39%), Bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), Clostridium botulinum strain ATCC 3502 (39%), Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain DCB-2 (38%) and Nitrosomonas europaea strain ATCC 25978 (37%). The gene homologous to cphA from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 was amplified by PCR, ligated to the vector pBluescript SK(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into Escherichia coli. The recombinant strain of E. coli expressed CphA activity at up to 1.2 U/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that CphA of Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 is functionally active. In Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as a storage compound in this strain.
TI  - Molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - The heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, FldABC, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) CoA-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-CoA to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-CoA and the product cinnamate mediated by FldA, a (R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-CoA to cinnamoyl-CoA mediated by heterodimeric FldBC, a phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase. Phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by ATP, MgCl2 and a reducing agent such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (FldI) present in the cell-free extract. All four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldAIBC, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related Clostridium botulinum Hall strain A. FldA shows sequence similarities to a new family of CoA-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme CoA-ester intermediates. An N-terminal Strep II-Tag containing enzymatically active FldI was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli. FldI was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin S = 3/2 in the reduced form. The amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and EPR-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component A of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC), which was able to replace FldI in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. Only in the oxidized state, FldI and component A exhibit significant ATPase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. Both subunits of phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase (FldBC) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB). The fldAIBC gene cluster resembles the hadAIBC gene cluster in the genome of Clostridium difficile and the hadABC,I genes in C. botulinum. The four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. This enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by C. difficile.
TI  - Characterization of the enzymatic component of the ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDTa from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Certain strains of Clostridium difficile produce the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT,  which is a binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin. The toxin consists of the binding component CDTb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component CDTa. Here we studied the enzyme component (CDTa) of the toxin using the binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ib), which is interchangeable with CDTb as a transport component. Ib was used because CDTb was not expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Similar to iota toxin, CDTa ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. The N-terminal part of CDTa (CDTa1-240) competes with full-length CDTa for binding to the iota toxin binding component. The C-terminal part (CDTa244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length CDTa. Changes of Glu428 and Glu430 to glutamine, Ser388 to alanine, and Arg345 to lysine blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Comparison of CDTa with C. perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment Ia208-413 but loss of activity of several N-terminally deleted C2I proteins including C2I103-431, C2I190-431, and C2I30-431. The data indicate that CDTa belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. It shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and C2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in NAD-binding and/or catalytic activity. The enzyme components of CDT, iota toxin, and C2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.
TI  - Recombinant Listeria strains producing the nontoxic L-chain of botulinum neurotoxin A in a soluble form.
AB  - Fragments of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) gene (botA) were expressed in Listeria monocytogenes ATCC10527 to produce the L-chain of the toxin in a soluble form. A shuttle vector pAT19 (EmR) was used to make plasmid pAT-RL containing a botA gene fragment placed under C. botulinum ntnH-gene promoter control. The plasmid also contained a C. botulinum botR/A gene, a positive transcriptional regulator of botA. The cytoplasmic fraction of the L. monocytogenes (pAT-RL) strain was found to contain up to 3 mg/L of a soluble protein of expected size and immunologically positive towards BoNT antibodies. This is the first evidence of heterologous botA gene expression producing a soluble safe derivative of botulinum neurotoxin A needed as a molecular tool for exploratory research in neurosciences as well as a basis for raising protective immunity in humans.
TI  - Phylogenetic positions of Clostridium novyi and Clostridium haemolyticum based on 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - The partial sequences (1465 bp) of the 16S rDNA of Clostridium novyi types A, B and C and Clostridium haemolyticum were determined. C. novyi types A, B and C and C. haemolyticum clustered with Clostridium botulinum types C and D. Moreover, the 16S rDNA sequences of C. novyi type B strains and C. haemolyticum strains were completely identical; they differed by 1 bp (level of similarity > 99.9%) from that of C. novyi type C, they were 98.7% homologous to that of C. novyi type A (relative positions 28-1520 of the Escherichia coli 16S rDNA sequence) and they exhibited a higher similarity to the 16S rDNA sequence of C. botulinum types D and C than to that of C. novyi type A. These results suggest that C. novyi types B and C and C. haemolyticum may be one independent species generated from the same phylogenetic origin.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - [Effective expression of fragments of a botulinum neurotoxin type A gene, coding  for the L-chain and H-chain in E. coli, with formation of products causing protective immunity to administration of the toxin].
AB  - Native Clostridium botulinum gene coding for type A neurotoxin has been used to construct recombinant derivatives coding separately for L and H polypeptide chains of the toxin. The gene derivatives have been cloned into an expression vector pET28b in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The recombinant L and H proteins seem to be the major individual proteins after IPTG induction of the recombinant cells. Each of the proteins has been accumulated only in inclusion bodies. The recombinant L chain (but not H chain) has been successfully resolubilized. Each of the proteins contains six His residues on the N terminus which allows purification on Ni-agarose columns with high yield. No toxic effect has been observed for both L and H chains after injection of 10 micrograms of recombinant preparations purified from inclusion bodies. Moreover, the injection resulted in an increase in the titer of specific antibodies which protected mice from 1 DLM of type A native botulinum neurotoxin. Hence, the recombinant neurotoxin protein derivatives which are present in E. coli inclusion bodies can be a source of material for producing diagnostic and therapeutic sera against type A botulinum neurotoxin.
TI  - Small GTPase Rho regulates thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.
AB  - Platelets play essential roles in hemostasis and thrombosis by aggregating with each other. However, the molecular mechanism governing platelet aggregation is not yet fully understood. Here, we established an assay system using platelets permeabilized with streptolysin-O to analyze mechanism of the thrombin-induced aggregation, focusing upon a controversial issue in the field whether small GTPase Rho regulates the aggregation. Incubation of the permeabilized platelets with Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor, an inhibitory regulator for Rho family GTPases, extracted Rho family proteins extensively from the plasma and intracellular membranes, and inhibited the thrombin-induced aggregation. Incubation of the permeabilized platelets with botulinum exoenzyme C3, which specifically inhibits Rho function by ADP-ribosylating it, abolished the thrombin-induced aggregation. Thus, Rho is involved in thrombin-induced aggregation of platelets.
TI  - Bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - Numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. The clostridial binary toxins (Iota and C2 families) ADP-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. The large clostridial toxins from Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the Rho family that regulate actin polymerization. In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from Escherichia coli activates Rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. The enterotoxin of Bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for E-cadherin and it promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The bacterial toxins that modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.
TI  - [Detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of pathogenic Clostridium  botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli. With this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 Shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. Optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with DNA and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. PCR was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. Its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. Among the tested C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and E. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. These findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. Strains containing type 2 Shigella-like toxin gene were detected among E. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome, which for the first time indicates that the problem with E. coli epidemic strain O157 is valid for Russia. As a result of our studies, test systems for detection of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G C. botulinum strains, C. perfringens and C. difficile, and E. coli O157 strains are now available.
TI  - Cloning, expression and evaluation of a recombinant sub-unit vaccine against Clostridium botulinum type F toxin.
AB  - A synthetic gene encoding the Hc (binding) domain of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin F (FHc) was expressed in Escherichia coli fused to maltose binding protein (MBP). The purified MBP-FHc and FHc isolated after removal of MBP were evaluated in mice for their ability to protect against toxin challenge. Balb/c mice developed a protective immune response following administration of either protein via the intraperitoneal or intramuscular routes. A comparison of antibody titres and protection following single and multiple vaccinations and the effects of dosage are shown. The long term protection afforded by the vaccines was also investigated. Ten months following vaccination mice were still protected when challenged with 10(4) MLD(50) doses of botulinum toxin F.
TI  - The C terminus of component C2II of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is essential for receptor binding.
AB  - The binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of two separate proteins, the  binding component C2II (80.5 kDa) and the actin-ADP-ribosylating enzyme component C2I (49.4 kDa). For its cytotoxic action, C2II binds to a cell membrane receptor and induces cell entry of C2I via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we studied the structure-function relationship of C2II by constructing truncated C2II proteins and producing polyclonal antisera against selective regions of C2II. An antibody raised against the C terminus (amino acids 592 to 721) of C2II inhibited binding of C2II to cells. The antibody prevented pore formation by C2II oligomers in artificial membranes but did not influence the properties of existing channels. To further define the region responsible for receptor binding, we constructed proteins with deletions in C2II; specifically, they lacked amino acid residues 592 to 721 and the 7 C-terminal amino acid residues. The truncated proteins still formed sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable oligomers but were unable to bind to cells. Our data indicate that the C terminus of C2II mediates binding of the protein to cells and that the 7 C-terminal amino acids are structurally important for receptor binding.
TI  - Tyrosine phosphorylation of the vascular endothelial-growth-factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) is modulated by Rho proteins.
AB  - The effects of Rho-specific modifying toxins on the tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell proteins were investigated. Incubation of the cells with the Rho-activating toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of signalling intermediates of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated cascade, including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, phospholipase Cgamma1 and a Shc-associated protein of 195 kDa. Both CNF1- and VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins were significantly reduced by prior incubation with C3 transferase, a known inhibitor of RhoA function, suggesting a Rho-dependent mechanism. The stimulation of endothelial cells with CNF1 resulted in a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2, which was correlated with a stimulation of its kinase activity and with its association with downstream tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. The stimulatory effect of CNF1 was specific for VEGFR-2 since the phosphotyrosine content of VEGFR-1 was not affected by the toxin. Transient overexpression of a dominant-active RhoA mutant also induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGFR-2, whereas overexpression of a dominant-inactive form of the protein was without effect. Taken together, these results indicate that Rho proteins may play an important role in angiogenesis by modulating the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of VEGFR-2.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - A Rho-related GTPase is involved in Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis.
AB  - Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only Rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. To determine the synaptic function of these GTPases, toxins that impair Rho-related proteins were microinjected into Aplysia neurons. We used lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inactivates Rac; toxin B from Clostridium difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; and C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from Escherichia coli, which mainly affect Rho. Analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the Rho family, most likely Rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin B could be completely removed in <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. Further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that Rac1 protein regulates a late step in Ca(2+)-dependent neuroexocytosis.
TI  - Bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small GTP-binding proteins.
AB  - Amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small GTPases of the Ras and Rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. Exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylates specifically Rho at R43 and prevents the recruitment of Rho on the cell membrane. This blocks the downstream effects of the Rho GTPase. However, exoenzyme C3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing C3 with the B moiety of either diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of C3. C. difficile toxin B modifies by glucosylation Rho on T37 and Rac and Cdc42 on T35. Glucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 blocks the binding of these GTPases on their downstream effectors. C. sordellii lethal toxin modifies Ras, Rap, and Rac on T35 by glucosylation. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, deamidates Q63 of Rho into E63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or GAP-mediated GTPase of Rho. This allows permanent activation of Rho. Thus, Rho GTPases are targets for three different toxin activities. Molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.
TI  - Neosynthesis and activation of Rho by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF1) reverse cytopathic effects of ADP-ribosylated Rho.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 inactivates the small GTPase Rho by ADP-ribosylation. We used a C3 fusion toxin (C2IN-C3) with high cell accessibility to study the kinetics of Rho inactivation by ADP-ribosylation. In primary cultures of rat astroglial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, C2IN-C3 induced the complete ADP-ribosylation of RhoA and concomitantly the disassembly of stress fibers within 3 h. Removal of C2IN-C3 from the medium caused the recovery of stress fibers and normal cell morphology within 4 h. The regeneration was preceded by the appearance of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA. Recovery of cell morphology was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and by the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin, indicating that intracellular degradation of the C3 fusion toxin and the neosynthesis of Rho were required for reversal of cell morphology. Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1, which activates Rho by deamidation of Gln(63), caused reconstitution of stress fibers and cell morphology in C2IN-C3-treated cells within 30-60 min. The effect of CNF1 was independent of RhoA neosynthesis and occurred in the presence of completely ADP-ribosylated RhoA. The data show three novel findings; 1) the cytopathic effects of ADP-ribosylation of Rho are rapidly reversed by neosynthesis of Rho, 2) CNF1-induced deamidation activates ADP-ribosylated Rho, and 3) inhibition of Rho activation but not inhibition of Rho-effector interaction is a major mechanism underlying inhibition of cellular functions of Rho by ADP-ribosylation.
TI  - 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors attenuate vascular smooth muscle proliferation by preventing rho GTPase-induced down-regulation of p27(Kip1).
AB  - The mechanism by which platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) DNA synthesis is unknown, but may involve isoprenoid intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (Sim, 1-10 microM), inhibited PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis by >95%, retinoblastoma gene product hyperphosphorylation by 90%, and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)-2, -4, and -6 activity by 80 +/- 5, 50 +/- 3, and 48 +/- 3%, respectively. This correlated with a 20-fold increase in p27(Kip1) without changes in p16, p21(Waf1), or p53 levels compared with PDGF alone. Since Ras and Rho require isoprenoid modification for membrane localization and are implicated in cell cycle regulation, we investigated the effects of Sim on Ras and Rho. Up-regulation of p27(Kip1) and inhibition of Rho but not Ras membrane translocation by Sim were reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate. Indeed, inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase or overexpression of dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant increased p27(Kip1) and inhibited retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation. In contrast, activation of Rho by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 decreased p27(Kip1) and increased SMC DNA synthesis. These findings indicate that the down-regulation of p27(Kip1) by Rho GTPase mediates PDGF-induced SMC DNA synthesis and suggest a novel direct effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors on the vascular wall.
TI  - Effects of cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 and lethal toxin on actin cytoskeleton  and VE-cadherin localization in human endothelial cell monolayers.
AB  - Integrity of the vascular endothelium is largely dependent on endothelial cell shape and establishment of intercellular junctions. Certain pathogenic bacterial toxins alter the cytoskeletal architecture of intoxicated cells by modulating the GTPase activity of p21 Rho family proteins. In the present study we have analyzed the effect of Rho-directed toxins on the actin cytoskeleton and monolayer integrity of endothelial cells. We report here that Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) activates Rho in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In confluent monolayers, CNF1 treatment induces prominent stress fiber formation without significantly modifying peripheral localization of VE-cadherin, a specific marker of vascular endothelial cell adherens junctions. Further, Rho activation with CNF1 blocks thrombin-induced redistribution of VE-cadherin staining and gap formation in HUVEC monolayers. Inhibition of Rho by prolonged treatment of cells with C3 exoenzyme (Clostridium botulinum) eliminates actin stress fibers without disrupting the continuity of VE-cadherin staining, indicating that Rho-dependent stress fibers are not required for maintaining this adhesion receptor at sites of intercellular contact. Lethal toxin (Clostridium sordellii), an inhibitor of Rac as well as Ras and Rap, potently disrupts the actin microfilament system and monolayer integrity in HUVEC cultures.
TI  - Bacterial toxins and the Rho GTP-binding protein: what microbes teach us about cell regulation.
AB  - In the present review activities of two bacterial toxins, Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 and Escherichia coli CNF1, both acting on the GTP-binding protein Rho are analyzed. Proteins belonging to the Rho family regulate the actin cytoskeleton and act as molecular switches in a number of signal transduction pathways. C3 and CNF1 have opposite effects on Rho thus representing useful tools for studies on cell division, cell differentiation and apoptosis.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector pJIR1457 to Clostridium botulinum type A strains.
AB  - An RP4-oriT shuttle vector pJIR1457 originally developed for Clostridium perfringens was successfully transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Clostridium botulinum type A strains and to a nontoxigenic C. botulinum type A-transposon Tn916 mutant strain lacking the entire toxin gene cluster. The light chain (LC) of botulinum toxin was highly expressed in the toxin deletion mutant strain from a pJIR1457 construct containing the recombinant botulinal gene for LC. This shuttle vector system will be valuable for genetic analysis of C. botulinum and will enable genetic manipulation and recombinant expression studies of botulinum neurotoxins as pharmaceutical agents.
TI  - A review of analytical methods for the detection of bacterial toxins.
AB  
TI  - Post-transcriptional regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA stability by Rho GTPase.
AB  - The mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors  increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression is unknown. To determine whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affects eNOS expression, human endothelial cells were treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (1-10 microM), in the presence of L-mevalonate (200 microM), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP, 1-10 microM), farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP, 5-10 microM), or low density lipoprotein (LDL, 1 mg/ml). Mevastatin increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels by 305 +/- 15% and 180 +/- 11%, respectively. Co-treatment with L-mevalonate or GGPP, but not FPP or LDL, reversed mevastatin's effects. Because Rho GTPases undergo geranylgeranyl modification, we investigated whether Rho regulates eNOS expression. Immunoblot analyses and [35S]GTPgammaS-binding assays revealed that mevastatin inhibited Rho membrane translocation and GTP binding activity by 60 +/- 5% and 78 +/- 6%, both of which were reversed by co-treatment with GGPP but not FPP. Furthermore, inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (50 microg/ml) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant increased eNOS expression. In contrast, activation of Rho by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (200 ng/ml) decreased eNOS expression. These findings indicate that Rho negatively regulates eNOS expression and that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors up-regulate eNOS expression by blocking Rho geranylgeranylation, which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity.
TI  - Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by thrombin in human endothelial cells: role of Rho proteins in endothelial barrier function.
AB  - Endothelial barrier function is regulated at the cellular level by cytoskeletal-dependent anchoring and retracting forces. In the present study we have examined the signal transduction pathways underlying agonist-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Receptor activation by thrombin, or the thrombin receptor (proteinase-activated receptor 1) agonist peptide, leads to an early increase in stress fiber formation followed by cortical actin accumulation and cell rounding. Selective inhibition of thrombin-stimulated signaling systems, including Gi/o (pertussis toxin sensitive), p42/p44, and p38 MAP kinase cascades, Src family kinases, PI-3 kinase, or S6 kinase pathways had no effect on the thrombin response. In contrast, staurosporine and KT5926, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, effectively blocked thrombin-induced cell rounding and retraction. The contribution of Rho to these effects was analyzed by using bacterial toxins that either activate or inhibit the GTPase. Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, an activator of Rho, induced the appearance of dense actin cables across cells without perturbing monolayer integrity. Accordingly, lysophosphatidic acid, an activator of Rho-dependent stress fiber formation in fibroblasts, led to reorganization of polymerized actin into stress fibers but failed to induce cell rounding. Inhibition of Rho with Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 fused to the B fragment of diphtheria toxin caused loss of stress fibers with only partial attenuation of thrombin-induced cell rounding. The implication of Rac and Cdc42 was analyzed in transient transfection experiments using either constitutively active (V12) or dominant-interfering (N17) mutants. Expression of RacV12 mimicked the effect of thrombin on cell rounding, and RacN17 blocked the response to thrombin, whereas Cdc42 mutants were without effect. These observations suggest that Rho is involved in the maintenance of endothelial barrier function and Rac participates in cytoskeletal remodeling by thrombin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
TI  - Indicative and pathogenic microbiological quality of aquacultured finfish grown in different production systems.
AB  - The nature and number of indicator and pathogenic microbes in fish reared using recirculating and nonrecirculating water systems were compared. For each system, 20 samples of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), tilapia (Oreochromis spp.), hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops), and pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) were randomly selected and gutted, and microbial analyses were performed using AOAC procedures. Five fish were subsampled and analyzed for indicative microbial quality with 3M Petrifilm (). The general microbial quality differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the production systems, except for total coliform counts. Rainbow trout cultured in recirculating and nonrecirculating water systems had lower counts for aerobes (2.00 to 3.11 log CFU/g) (p < 0.05), than other species, whereas trout reared in a recirculating water system had significantly lower psychrotrophic numbers (0.86 to 1.85 log CFU/g). Pacu had the highest fecal coliform counts (2.74 to 3.70 log CFU/g), whereas hybrid striped bass and rainbow trout grown in nonrecirculating systems had lower fecal coliform counts (0.00 to 1.39 log CFU/g). Rainbow trout grown in a nonrecirculating system had significantly higher Escherichia coli counts (0.00 to 2.11 log CFU/g). The human bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. were not isolated form the fish sampled. However, Clostridium botulinum botulinum was isolated from all the aquacultured fish sampled except pacu and tilapia grown in a recirculating aquaculture system. However, the counts were very low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.3 MPN/g.
TI  - Inhibition of Rho is required for cAMP-induced melanoma cell differentiation.
AB  - Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. Here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. Since Rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein in cAMP-induced dendrite formation. Clostridium botulinum C3 exotransferase, which inhibits Rho, mimicked the effect of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the Escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF-1), which activates Rho and the expression of a constitutively active Rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the Rho target p160 Rho-kinase (P160(ROCK)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of cAMP. Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho and of its target p160(ROCK) are required events for cAMP-induced dendrite outgrowth in B16 cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that Rho is involved in the regulation of melanogenesis. Indeed, Rho inactivation enhanced the cAMP stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while Rho constitutive activation impaired these cAMP-induced effects. This reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, Rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by cAMP.
TI  - Novel galactose-binding proteins in Annelida. Characterization of 29-kDa tandem repeat-type lectins from the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris.
AB  - Novel type lectins were found in the phylum Annelida, i.e. in the earthworm, tubifex, leech, and lugworm. The lectins (29-31 kDa) were extracted from the worms without the use of detergent and purified by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-agarose. On the basis of the partial primary structures of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris 29-kDa lectin (EW29), degenerate primers were synthesized for use in the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. An amplified 155-base pair fragment was used to screen a cDNA library. Four types of full-length clones were obtained, all of which encoded 260 amino acids, but which were found to differ at 29 nucleotide positions. Since three of them resulted in non-silent substitutions, EW29 mRNA was considered to be a mixture of at least three distinct polynucleotides encoding the following proteins: Ala44-Gln197-Ile213 (clone 5), Gly44-Gln197-Val213 (clone 7), and Ala44-His197-Ile213 (clones 8 and 9; different at the nucleotide level, but encoding an identical polypeptide). Genomic polymerase chain reaction using DNA from a single worm revealed that the single worm already had four sets of cDNAs. The EW29 protein showed two features. First, the lectin was composed of two homologous domains (14,500 Da) showing 27% identity with each other. When each of the domains was separately expressed in Escherichia coli, the C-terminal domain was found to bind to asialofetuin-agarose as strongly as the whole protein, whereas the N-terminal domain did not bind and only retardation was observed. EW29 was found to exist as a monomer under non-denaturing conditions. It had significant hemagglutinating activity, which was inhibited by a wide range of galactose-containing saccharides. Second, EW29 contained multiple short conserved motifs, "Gly-X-X-X-Gln-X-Trp." Similar motifs have been found in many carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from an extensive variety of organisms, e.g. plant lectin ricin B-chain and Clostridium botulinum 33-kDa hemagglutinin. Therefore, these carbohydrate-recognition proteins appear to form a protein superfamily.
TI  - Produce handling and processing practices.
AB  - In the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the United States. Changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. Pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. Contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. Surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. Treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. Reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.
TI  - Recombinant SNAP-25 is an effective substrate for Clostridium botulinum type A toxin endopeptidase activity in vitro.
AB  - Bacterial neurotoxins are now being used routinely for the treatment of neuromuscular conditions. Alternative assays to replace or to complement in vivo bioassay methods for assessment of the safety and potency of these botulinum neurotoxin-based therapeutic products are urgently needed. Advances made in understanding the mode of action of clostridial neurotoxins have provided the basis for the development of alternative mechanism-based assay methods. Thus, the identification of SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of molecular mass 25 kDa) as the intracellular protein target which is selectively cleaved during poisoning by botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) has enabled the development of a functional in vitro assay for this toxin. Using recombinant DNA methods, a segment of SNAP-25 (aa residues 134-206) spanning the toxin cleavage site was prepared as a fusion protein to the maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and the fragment isolated after cleavage with Factor Xa. Targeted antibodies specific for the N and C termini of SNAP-25, as well as the toxin cleavage site, were prepared and used in an immunoassay to demonstrate BoNT/A endopeptidase activity towards recombinant SNAP-25 substrates. The reaction required low concentrations of reducing agents which were inhibitory at higher concentrations as were metal chelators and some inhibitors of metallopeptidases. The endopeptidase assay has proved to be more sensitive than the mouse bioassay for detection of toxin in therapeutic preparations. A good correlation with results obtained in the in vivo bioassay (r = 0.95, n = 23) was demonstrated. The endopeptidase assay described here may provide a suitable replacement assay for the estimation of the potency of type A toxin in therapeutic preparations.
TI  - Role of Rho protein in lovastatin-induced breakdown of actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - The Rho GTPases are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. They need polyisoprenylation for membrane association and activation. Lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitor, prevents isoprene synthesis and thereby lipid modification of the Rho protein carboxy terminus. Because lovastatin causes rounding up of cultured cells, we investigated whether the compound acts on the actin cytoskeleton through Rho proteins. Lovastatin treatment decreased F-actin content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. G-actin content remained unchanged. In lovastatin-treated NIH 3T3 cells, the amount of Rho protein which was ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 decreased in membranes and increased in the cytosol fraction. Cycloheximide prevented lovastatin-induced rounding up of cells. However, after microinjection or direct application of exoenzyme C3, cells treated with cycloheximide and lovastatin rounded up again. On the contrary, lovastatin-treated, round Swiss 3T3 cells reverted to a flat morphology when microinjected with dominant active RhoA (Val14RhoA). Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF1) which activates Rho proteins caused flattening of round, lovastatin-treated NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that lovastatin affects the actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of Rho proteins.
TI  - Induction of an immune response by oral administration of recombinant botulinum toxin.
AB  - A gene encoding the full-size botulinum neurotoxin serotype C was reconstructed in vector pQE-30 and expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. Three amino acid mutations (H229-->G, E230-->T, and H233-->N) were generated in the zinc-binding motif, resulting in complete detoxification of the modified recombinant holotoxin. The PCR-amplified wild-type light chain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype C was also expressed in E. coli and used as a control in all experiments. Modified recombinant holotoxin and light chain contained a histidine affinity tag at the amino terminus, which was used for detection and purification. Recombinant proteins were purified on nickel affinity resin and analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-histidine tag and anti-neurotoxin C antibodies. The results indicated that the 150-kDa molecule of modified recombinant holotoxin and the 50-kDa recombinant light chain were synthesized without degradation; however, E. coli did not provide for efficient nicking of modified recombinant toxin. Modified recombinant holotoxin was not toxic to mice, had no effect on nerve-evoked muscle twitch in vitro, and was not able to cleave syntaxin in crude synaptosome preparations. The recombinant light chain was also nontoxic in vivo, had no effect on evoked muscle twitch, but was able to cleave syntaxin. Modified recombinant neurotoxin and light chain were administered to animals either orally or subcutaneously. Both oral administration and subcutaneous administration of modified recombinant neurotoxin evoked high levels of serum antibodies and protective immunity. Oral administration of recombinant light chain evoked no systemic response, whereas subcutaneous administration evoked antibody production and immunity.
TI  - Cleavage of the synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) of the mouse brain by the recombinant light chain of Clostridium botulinum type B toxin.
AB  - The light chain of Clostridium botulinum type B toxin was expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pEt-3a containing phage T7 promoter. The expressed protein was then purified by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography and the proteolytic activity of the purified light chain was studied. The purified recombinant light chain cleaved synaptobrevin when mixed with the mouse brain microsome and the proteolytic activity of the light chain was inhibited if a metal chelating agent such as EDTA or 2,2'-dipyridyl was added. The recombinant light chain cleaved synaptobrevin more effectively than the native type B toxin. When the native toxin was trypinized and was reduced with DTT, its proteolytic activity was similar to that of the recombinant light chain.
TI  - Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from Escherichia coli and dermonecrotic toxin from Bordetella bronchiseptica induce p21(rho)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin in Swiss 3T3 cells.
AB  - Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli and dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) from Bordetella bronchiseptica, which directly target and activate p21(rho), stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125(fak)) and paxillin. Tyrosine phosphorylation induced by CNF1 and DNT occurred after a pronounced lag period (2 h), and was blocked by either lysosomotrophic agents or incubation at 22 degrees C. CNF1 and DNT stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125(fak) and paxillin, actin stress fiber formation, and focal adhesion assembly with similar kinetics. Cytochalasin D and high concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and completely inhibited CNF1 and DNT induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Microinjection of Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates p21(rho) function, prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in response to either CNF1 or DNT. In addition, our results demonstrated that CNF1 and DNT do not induce protein kinase C activation, inositol phosphate formation, and Ca2+ mobilization. Moreover, CNF1 and DNT stimulated DNA synthesis without activation of p42(mapk) and p44(mapk) providing additional evidence for a novel p21(rho)-dependent signaling pathway that leads to entry into the S phase of the cell cycle in Swiss 3T3.
TI  - Mapping of protective and cross-reactive domains of the type A neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the location of domains within the serotype A neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum (BoNT/A) that conferred protection against botulism. The BoNT/A gene was subcloned into a series of 10 overlapping fragments that were expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed proteins were partially purified and used to immunize mice. The resulting antisera were screened by immunoblotting analysis for the presence of BoNT/A-specific antibody. All fragments, except one, elicited antibody that recognized BoNT/A in an immunoblot. Serological screening identified several fragment-specific cross-reactive epitopes that were shared by heterologous serotypes of BoNT. Most of these epitopes immunoreactive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but not by immunoblot. Only two fragments were shown to confer protection against BoNT/A intoxication. Both of these proteins were derived from segments of the heavy chain and encoded amino acid residues H455-661 and H1150-1289 of BoNT/A.
TI  - Surveillance for foodborne-disease outbreaks--United States, 1988-1992.
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1973, CDC has maintained a collaborative surveillance program for collection and periodic reporting of data concerning the occurrence and causes of foodborne-disease outbreaks (FBDOs). REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This summary reviews data from January 1988 through December 1992. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The surveillance system reviews data concerning FBDOs--defined as the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food. Before 1992, only one case of intoxication by chemical, marine toxin, or Clostridium botulinum toxin as a result of the ingestion of food was required to constitute an FBDO. Since 1992, two or more cases have been required. State and local public health departments have primary responsibility for the identifying and investigating FBDOs. State and territorial health departments report these outbreaks to CDC on a standard form. RESULTS: During 1988-1992, a total of 2,423 outbreaks of foodborne disease were reported (451 in 1988, 505 in 1989, 532 in 1990, 528 in 1991, and 407 in 1992). These outbreaks caused a reported 77,373 persons to become ill. Among outbreaks for which the etiology was determined, bacterial pathogens caused the largest percentage of outbreaks (79%) and the largest percentage of cases (90%). Salmonella serotype Enteritidis accounted for the largest number of outbreaks, cases, and deaths; most of these outbreaks were attributed to eating undercooked, infected eggs. Chemical agents caused 14% of outbreaks and 2% of cases; parasites, 2% of outbreaks and 1% of cases; and viruses, 4% of outbreaks and 6% of cases. INTERPRETATION: The number of FBDOs reported per year did not change substantially during the first 4 years but declined in 1992 as a result of the revised definition of an outbreak. During this reporting period, S. Enteritidis continued to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In addition, multistate outbreaks caused by contaminated produce and outbreaks caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 became more prominent. ACTIONS TAKEN: State and local public health departments investigate FBDOs. At the regional and national level, surveillance data provide an indication of the etiologic agents, vehicles of transmission, and contributing factors associated with FBDOs and help direct public health actions.
TI  - Evidence that Arg-295, Glu-378, and Glu-380 are active-site residues of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of iota toxin.
AB  - The active site of the enzymatic component (Ia) of the Clostridium perfringens iota toxin has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment showed that Ia and C3 enzymes display a segment in their C-terminal part which is homologous to that forming the active domain of pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli thermolabile toxins. This structure consists of a beta-strand and an alpha-helix which forms the NAD-binding cavity and which is flanked by two catalytic spatially conserved residues involved in catalysis [Domenighini et al. (1994) Mol. Microbiol. 14, 41-50]. Substitutions (Arg-295-Lys, Glu-378-Ala, Glu-380-Asp, and Glu-380-Ala) induced a drastic decrease in ADP-ribosylation and cytotoxic activities, while substitution of the adjacent Arg (Arg-296-Lys) only partially affected the enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. These results indicate that Arg-295, Glu-378 and Glu-380 of Ia are involved in the ADP-ribosylation activity which is essential for the morphological changes of cells treated with iota toxin.
TI  - Inhibition of NAD+ glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities of leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38 by gangliosides.
AB  - We have recently reported that gangliosides act as inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferases and NAD+ glycohydrolases (NADase) of pertussis toxin and the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum (Hara-Yokoyama, M., Hirabayashi, Y., Irie, F., Syuto, B., Moriishi, K., Sugiya, H., and Furuyama, S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8115-8121). Here, we investigated the effect of gangliosides on the enzymatic activity of leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38, which is identified as an ecto-NADase (Kontani, K., Nishina, H., Ohoka, Y., Takahashi, K., and Katada, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16895-16898). Gangliosides GM1a and GQ1balpha inhibited the NADase activity in the immunoprecipitate of anti-CD38 antibody from the membrane extract of retinoic acid-treated human leukemic HL-60 cells. Gangliosides also inhibited the NADase activity of the extracellular domain of CD38 antigen that was deprived of the transmembrane domain and was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP-CD38). The order of the inhibitory effect of purified ganglioside species on the NADase activity on MBP-CD38 was as follows: GQ1balpha > GT1b, GQ1b > GD1a, GD1b, GM1a, GM1b, GD3, GM3. GQ1balpha inhibited the NADase of MBP-CD38 in a noncompetitive manner versus NAD+ with a Ki value of about 0.3 microM. Neither ceramide nor the oligosaccharide moiety of GQ1balpha had an effect on the NADase activity. GQ1balpha, GT1b, and GQ1b also efficiently inhibited the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of MBP-CD38. At present, gangliosides are the only endogenous species that can block the enzymatic activity of CD38 antigen. The present results suggest a potential role of gangliosides as inhibitors of the ecto-NADases.
TI  - Active site mutation of the C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase from Clostridium limosum--analysis of glutamic acid 174.
AB  - Clostridium limosum ADP-ribosyltransferase modifies low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subtype family. Here we cloned and sequenced the gene of the transferase and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The gene encodes a protein of 250 amino acids (M(r) = 27,840), with a putative signal peptide of 45 amino acids, that shows about 60-65% identity with C3 transferases from Clostridium botulinum. The mature C. limosum transferase was expressed as a maltose-binding fusion protein in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. To study the functional role of Glu174 of C. limosum transferase, which was recently photoaffinity-labeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD [Jung, M., et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23215-23218], two mutants E174D and E174Q were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction-based system. The E174D and E174Q mutants showed a dramatic decrease in kcat, but no major changes in Km,NAD. Furthermore, replacement of Glu174 by aspartic acid and glutamine largely reduced and completely blocked UV-induced incorporation of [carbonyl-14C]NAD into the transferase. The data indicate that Glu174 is an active site residue of C. limosum transferase.

TI  - Synergistic activation of rat brain phospholipase D by ADP-ribosylation factor and rhoA p21, and its inhibition by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme.
AB  - An activator of rat brain phospholipase D (PLD) that is distinct from the already identified PLD activator, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), was partially purified from bovine brain cytosol by a series of chromatographic steps. The partially purified preparation contained a 22-kDa substrate for Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme ADP-ribosyltransferase, which strongly reacted with anti-rhoA p21 antibody, but not with anti-rac1 p21 or anti-cdc42Hs p21 antibody. Treatment of the partially purified PLD-activating factor with both C3 exoenzyme and NAD significantly inhibited the PLD-stimulating activity. These results suggest that rhoA p21 is, at least in part, responsible for the PLD-stimulating activity in the preparation. Recombinant isoprenylated rhoA p21 expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells activated rat brain PLD in a concentration- and GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))-dependent manner. In contrast, recombinant non-isoprenylated rhoA p21 (fused to glutathione S-transferase) expressed in Escherichia coli failed to activate the PLD. This difference cannot be explained by a lower affinity of non-isoprenylated rhoA p21 for GTP gamma S, as the rates of [35S]GTP gamma S binding were very similar for both recombinant preparations and the GTP gamma S-bound form of non-isoprenylated rhoA p21 did not induce PLD activation. Interestingly, recombinant isoprenylated rhoA p21 and ARF synergistically activated rat brain PLD; a similar pattern was seen with the partially purified PLD-activating factor. The synergistic activation was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of recombinant isoprenylated rhoA p21 in a NAD-dependent manner. Inhibition correlated with the extent of ADP-ribosylation. These findings suggest that rhoA p21 regulates rat brain PLD in concert with ARF, and that isoprenylation of rhoA p21 is essential for PLD regulation in vitro.
TI  - Detection of arginine-ADP-ribosylated protein using recombinant ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase.
AB  - We made use of ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase to detect arginine-ADP- ribosylated  proteins. The hydrolase was expressed in Escherichia coli as a protein fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The fusion protein GST-ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of alpha-ADP-ribosylarginine to produce ADP-ribose and arginine. Casein ADP-ribosylated with [32P]NAD and chicken heterophil arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase served as a substrate for the recombinant ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase and the released ADP-ribose was determined. Protein ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin could serve as substrate of the hydrolase but protein ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, diphtheria toxin, or C(3) enzyme of Clostridium botulinum could not. The hydrolase did not release the radioactivity incorporated into isolated rat liver nuclei incubated with [(32)P]NAD or in bovine brain cytosol incubated with [(32)P]ADP-ribose. In homogenate of mouse heart which contained arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase, labeling of a 55-kDa protein by incubation with [(32)P]NAD was removed by ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase treatment; hence, the specific hydrolysis of ADP-ribose-arginine bond by GST-ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase can be used to detect the arginine-ADP-ribosylated proteins in crude preparations. Arginine--ADP-ribosylated proteins in crude preparations. Arginine-ADP-ribosylated proteins in mouse spleen lymphocytes were identified using this method.
TI  - Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1: evidence for induction of actin  assembly by constitutive activation of the p21 Rho GTPase.
AB  - Cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1) induces in HEp-2 cells an increase in  F-actin structures, which was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 24 h after addition of this factor to the culture medium. Increase in F-actin was correlated with the augmentation of both the cell volume and the total cell actin content. Actin assembly-disassembly is controlled by small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, which have been reported recently to be modified by CNF1 treatment. Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3, both known to act on the Rho GTPase, were used as biological tools to study the effect of CNF1 on this protein. CNF1 incubated before, during, or after exposure to the chimeric toxin C3B (which is the product of a genetic fusion between the DNA coding for C3 and the one coding for the B fragment of diphtheria toxin) protected HEp-2 cells from the disruption of F-actin structures caused by inactivation of the Rho GTPase through its ADP-ribosylation. On the other hand, C. difficile toxin B cytopathic effect was not observed upon preincubation of cells with CNF1. Toxins acting through a Rho-independent mechanism, such as cytochalasin D and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like toxin, could not be modified in their cellular activities by CNF1 treatment. All of our results suggest that CNF1 modifies the Rho molecule, thus probably protecting this GTPase from further bacterial toxin modification.
TI  - Protective vaccination with a recombinant fragment of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A expressed from a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A completely synthetic gene encoding fragment C, a approximately 50-kDa fragment, of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A was constructed from oligonucleotides. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and full-sized product was produced as judged by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Crude extracts of E. coli expressing the gene were used to vaccinate mice and evaluate their survival against challenge with active toxin. Mice given three subcutaneous vaccinations were protected against an intraperitoneal administration of 10(6) 50% lethal doses (ID50) of serotype A toxin. The same mice survived when challenged with 3 LD50 of botulinum toxin serotype E but died when challenged with 10 LD50 of serotype E or 3 LD50 of serotype B. Purified fragment C was compared with the botulinum toxoid vaccine in a vaccination and challenge study. Fragment C was as efficacious in protecting against challenge with active botulinum neurotoxin serotype A as the toxoid vaccine. This recombinant protein product has many properties that make it a good candidate for human use to protect against botulinum toxin.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  - Comparative analysis of C3 and botulinal neurotoxin genes and their environment in Clostridium botulinum types C and D.
AB  - The C3 exoenzyme gene is located on a bacteriophage in Clostridium botulinum types C and D (M. R. Popoff, D. Hauser, P. Boquet, M. W. Eklund, and D. M. Gill, Infect. Immun. 59:3673-3679, 1991). A derivative CN phage from phage C of C. botulinum Stockholm (C-St) (K. Oguma, H. Iida, and K. Inoue, Jpn. J. Microbiol. 19:167-172, 1975), isolated as neurotoxin negative, also does not produce exoenzyme C3. The botulinal neurotoxin C1 gene is present on the CN phage but contains a stop mutation in the DNA region encoding the N-terminal part of the heavy chain (codon 553). The putative truncated botulinal neurotoxin C1 protein was not recovered in a C. botulinum strain harboring the CN phage. We found that the C3 gene is localized on a 21.5-kbp DNA fragment flanked by the core motif 5'-AAGGAG-3' in DNAs of phage C of C. botulinum 468 (C-468), C-St phage, and phage D of C. botulinum 1873 (D-1873). The 21.5-kbp DNA fragment is deleted in CN phage DNA, and the motif 5'-AAGGAG-3' is present only in one copy at the deletion junction, but the deletion in the CN phage could be nonspecific, since this phage was obtained by nitrosoguanidine treatment. These findings could indicate that the C3 gene is localized on a 21.5-kbp mobile element. C. botulinum type C strain 003-9 produces a C3 exoenzyme (Y. Nemoto, T. Namba, S. Kozaki, and S. Narumiya, J. Biol. Chem. 266:19312-19319, 1991), and Staphylococcus aureus E1 produces a related C3 enzyme which is named epidernmal cell differentiation inhibitor (S. Inoue, M. Sugai, Y. Murooka, S. Y. Paik, Y. M. Hong, H. Oghai, and H. Suginaka, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 174:459-464, 1991) and which shares 80.6 and 56.6% similarity, respectively with the C3 enzymes from C-468 or C-St and D-1873 phages athe amino acid level. The features of the putative 21.5-kbp transposon were not found in C. botulinum 003-9 and S. aureus E1, as determined by analysis of the C3 and epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor gene-flanking DNA regions. These data suggest a common ancestral origin and divergent evolution of the C3 genes in these three groups of bacterial strains and dissemination of a 21.5-kbp element carrying the C3 gene C-468, C-St, and D-1873 phages.
TI  - Gene probes for identification of the botulinal neurotoxin gene and specific identification of neurotoxin types B, E, and F.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction method was developed for the specific detection of the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) gene of Clostridium botulinum. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed from the nucleotide sequence of the heavy chain of the BoNT gene, amplified a specific fragment of approximately 1.1 kb from strains of C. botulinum toxin types A, B, E, F, and G and neurotoxin-producing strains of Clostridium barati and Clostridium butyricum, but no fragment was obtained from nontoxigenic strains. The fragments amplified from several strains of C. botulinum types B, E, and F were cloned in Escherichia coli and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Sequences within this region were used to design oligonucleotide probes specific for BoNT type B (BoNT/B), BoNT/E, and BoNT/F genes. An additional probe was designed for the detection of the BoNT/F gene of C. barati, which differed in sequence from BoNT/F genes of both proteolytic and nonproteolytic strains of C. botulinum.
TI  - A chimeric toxin to study the role of the 21 kDa GTP binding protein rho in the control of actin microfilament assembly.
AB  - We have developed a new tool for studying the role of rho in actin stress fibre formation. Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 which affects actin microfilament assembly by ADP-ribosylation of p21 rho was genetically fused in various ways to diphtheria toxin (DT). The resulting chimeric toxins were tested on Vero cells. Chimeras of C3 and both the A and B fragments of diphtheria toxin had reduced cell binding activities but were apparently able to penetrate into Vero cells by the same mechanism as DT. Upon exposure to low pH, DC3B, a fusion protein of C3 and DT B fragment, had a high affinity for the DT receptor, but was apparently not able to translocate to the cytosol upon acidification. In spite of this, addition of picomolar concentrations of DC3B to the growth medium caused disruption of the cell microfilament system associated with vinculin and blocked cell growth efficiently, indicating that the C3 part of DC3B reached the cytosol, albeit by a different mechanism than that of whole diphtheria toxin. The chimeric DC3B toxin was also applied to Vero cells infected by Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogenic bacterium that uses an unknown mechanism of actin polymerization to move rapidly in the cytosol. DC3B inhibited the bacterially induced microfilament assembly indicating that L. monocytogenes utilizes a cellular rho dependent mechanism in this process.
TI  - Studies on the large subunit ribosomal RNA genes and intergenic spacer regions of non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum types B, E and F.
AB  - The large-subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (23S rRNA) genes of non-proteolytic  (group II) strains of Clostridium botulinum toxin types B, E and F were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cloned in Escherichia coli. Sequence determination showed that the 23S rRNA genes were 2910 nucleotides in length, and comparative analysis revealed approximately 99.5% sequence similarity. The 23S rRNA gene sequence of a strain phenotypically resembling non-proteolytic C. botulinum, except in not producing botulinal neurotoxin, was also determined and displayed 99.5% sequence similarity with those from toxigenic strains. A diagnostic sequence within the 23S rRNA characteristic for non-proteolytic C. botulinum was identified and used for the design of an oligonucleotide probe. Molecular hybridizations with PCR-amplified rDNA targets provided a precise and reliable method of identifying non-proteolytic (or Group II) C. botulinum and closely related non-toxigenic strains.
TI  - Analysis of operons encoding 23S rRNA of Clostridium botulinum type A.
AB  - Southern hybridization analysis of Clostridium botulinum type A chromosomal DNA indicated the presence of six copies of the 23S rRNA gene. Fragments of DNA encoding 23S rRNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in Escherichia coli. Three clones examined by restriction enzyme and sequence analysis were found to be derived from different operons. Sequence determination of the entire insert of two clones revealed nine nucleotide changes in the genes coding for 23S rRNA (99.7% sequence identity) between operons encoded on the same chromosome, showing microheterogeneity in the rRNA operons of this organism.
TI  - Susceptibility to infection in relation to SIDS.
AB  - Because there is little evidence that invasive bacterial diseases contribute to cot deaths, most studies on infectious causes of SIDS have focused on viruses or toxin producing bacteria. Although epidemiological studies found marginally significant associations between influenza virus and SIDS, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was isolated from 90% of older infants with SIDS. There are conflicting reports that some toxigenic bacteria (Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficle, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) might be implicated in cot deaths. S aureus are common micro-organisms and their toxins are very powerful. As the pyrogenic toxic shock syndrome toxin of S aureus can kill a previously healthy adult, it might easily kill a small infant. Based on our studies on susceptibility of infants to other infections, we suggest the following might be factors leading to colonisation of infants by toxin producing S aureus: The Lewis blood group antigen appears to act as a receptor for some micro-organisms. Epithelial cells expressing high concentrations of Lewis bound appreciably more toxin producing S aureus than cells expressing low concentrations of the antigen. Lewis is expressed in secretions of nearly 90% of infants aged 3 months, the peak age for SIDS. RSV infects about 50% of infants by the first year of life and it is often isolated from infants with SIDS. Studies in our laboratory indicate that RSV infected HEp-2 cells bind more toxin producing S aureus than uninfected controls.
TI  - The complete amino acid sequence of the Clostridium botulinum type D neurotoxin,  deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis of the encoding phage d-16 phi genome.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of Clostridium botulinum type D strain CB16 neurotoxin was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence is reported here for the first time. The structure and function of botulinum type D neurotoxin is discussed from a molecular biological viewpoint. DNA was extracted from toxin-converting phage d-16 phi of C. botulinum type D strain CB16, and a fragment (about 10 kbp) coding for the neurotoxin was cloned into Escherichia coli using lambda gt11. A 21-mer oligonucleotide which corresponds to Phe7 to Val13 of the partial amino acid sequence near the N-terminus of the type D neurotoxin was synthesized and used as a probe to identify the gene encoding type D neurotoxin. The nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for 1,275 amino acids (molecular weight of 146,785) and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded exactly to the partial amino acid sequences determined by direct microsequencing of the neurotoxin fragments. In the dichain molecule of the neurotoxin, Thr2 and Asn443 formed the N-termini of the light chain (M.W. 50,410) and heavy chain (M.W. 96,394) respectively, and these two chains were linked with a disulfide bond between Cys437 on the light chain and Cys450 on the heavy chain. The nucleotide sequence of the D-CB16 neurotoxin differed from that previously reported for type D neurotoxin by three nucleotides.
TI  - Posttranslational isoprenylation of rho protein is a prerequisite for its interaction with mastoparan and other amphiphilic agents.
AB  - The amphiphilic agents melittin, compound 48/80 and mastoparan inhibit ADP-ribosylation of porcine brain rho protein by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3. However, ADP-ribosylation of recombinant rhoA expressed in E.coli was not inhibited by these agents. Accordingly, steady state GTP hydrolysis by recombinant rhoA was not stimulated by mastoparan, whereas GTP hydrolysis by porcine brain rho was stimulated 2.5-fold in the presence of this wasp venom. After microinjection of recombinant rhoA into Xenopus laevis oocytes the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on C3 ADP-ribosylation was restored. The data suggest that the amphiphilic agents tested are only active at the posttranslationally processed form of rho and that they exert their effects via the C-terminal end.
TI  - Rac1, a low-molecular-mass GTP-binding-protein with high intrinsic GTPase activity and distinct biochemical properties.
AB  - Rac1, a member of the family of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins, functions in phagocytic leukocytes as a component necessary for activation of the respiratory burst. To characterize the biochemical properties of rac1, the protein was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 99% homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Rac1 protein bound maximally bound and hydrolyzed GTP under low free-Mg2+ concentrations. Under those conditions, (45 nm free Mg2+), purified rac1 exhibited a steady-state GTPase activity of 18 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 (turnover number approximately 0.39 min-1 at 37 degrees C), which is 40-fold higher than H-ras. The high intrinsic GTPase activity of rac1 under low free Mg2+ was mainly due to an increased kcat, the rate constant for hydrolysis of bound GTP, which was 0.29 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.007 min-1 for H-ras (at 20 degrees C). Rac1 also released bound GDP faster than H-ras (koff.GDP = 1.02 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.33 min-1 for H-ras at 20 degrees C). In contrast, rac1 released bound guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) at a slower rate than H-ras (koff.GTP[S] approximately 0.04 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.31 min-1 for H-ras at 20 degrees C). Rac1 was a very good substrate for in vitro geranylgeranylation (C20) but not for farnesylation (C15), whereas the converse is true for H-ras. Surprisingly, rac1 was a very poor substrate for in vitro ADP-ribosylation by the C3 component of Clostridium botulinum toxin compared to rhoA. As a further characterization of rac1, a mutant was made in which the Thr115 was replaced by asparagine. This protein (referred to as [Thr115----Asn]rac1) contains the consensus amino acids of all four GTP-binding domains of H-ras. The koff.GDP of [Thr115----Asn]rac1 was reduced to that of H-ras, but [Thr115----Asn]rac1 exhibited essentially identical kcat (0.13 min-1 at 20 degrees C) and koff-GTP[S] (0.03 min-1 at 20 degrees C) values as the wild-type protein. Thus, the region(s) in rac1 which control the dissociation of GTP[S] (and presumably GTP) do not entirely coincide with those controlling GDP dissociation. Biochemical analysis of [Thr115----Asn]rac1 also suggests that the region responsible for the increased kcat of rac1 is not within the consensus amino acids of the four guanine-nucleotide-binding domains.
TI  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin component of Clostridium botulinum type C progenitor toxin.
AB  - The structural gene for a nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin component of Clostridium botulinum type C progenitor toxin was found to exist on a 7.8 kb DNA fragment obtained from a type C phage DNA. The gene existed between the neurotoxin and hemagglutinin genes, and consisted of an 3588 bp open reading frame (1196 amino acid residues). It was speculated that this gene and the neurotoxin gene were transcribed by the same mRNA (polycistronic transcription) in C. botulinum organisms.
TI  - Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase gene. Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a functional protein in Escherichia coli.
AB  - C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase is an exoenzyme produced by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum types C and D, which specifically ADP-ribosylates rho and rac proteins in eukaryotic cells. The enzyme was purified from a culture filtrate of C. botulinum type C strain 003-9, and the amino acid sequence from the amino-terminal Ser to Asn192 was determined by Edman degradation. Using a set of degenerate primers based on the sequence, we amplified a part of the gene for this enzyme by polymerase chain reaction. A 2.1-kilobase pair HincII fragment of C. botulinum DNA containing the whole structural gene was then identified by Southern analysis with the polymerase chain reaction product as a probe, and the complete nucleotide structure of the gene together with flanking regions was determined by cloning and DNA sequencing the HincII fragment. The gene encodes a protein of 244 amino acids with a Mr of 27,362 which begins with a putative signal peptide of 40 amino acids. Escherichia coli carrying this gene produced the active enzyme, and about 60% of it was found in the culture medium. Immunoblot analysis with antiserum against the enzyme revealed the presence of two immunoreactive proteins of 27 and 23 kDa in the cytoplasmic/membrane fraction and only the 23-kDa protein in the periplasm and the medium, suggesting that the enzyme expressed is processed in the E. coli, exported into the periplasm and released into the culture medium.
TI  - Characterization of the C3 gene of Clostridium botulinum types C and D and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum type C and D strains produce exoenzyme C3, which ADP-ribosylates the Rho protein, a 21-kDa regulatory GTP-binding protein. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the C3 gene is encoded by bacteriophages C and D of C. botulinum by using DNA-DNA hybridizations with oligonucleotides deduced from the C3 protein N-terminal sequence. The C3 coding gene was cloned and sequenced, but its upstream DNA region could not be studied because of its instability in Escherichia coli. In this work, the upstream DNA region of the C3 gene was directly amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The C3 gene encodes a polypeptide of 251 amino acids (27,823 Da) consisting of a 40-amino-acid signal peptide and a mature protein of 211 amino acids (23,546 Da). The C3 mature protein was expressed in E. coli under the control of the trc promoter. The recombinant polypeptide obtained was recognized by C3 antibodies and ADP-ribosylated the Rho protein. The C3 gene nucleotide sequence is identical on C and D phage DNAs. At the amino acid sequence level, no similarity was found among C3, other ADP-ribosylating toxins, or tetanus or botulinal A, C1, and D neurotoxins.
TI  - Cloning of the structural gene for Clostridium botulinum type C1 toxin and whole  nucleotide sequence of its light chain component.
AB  - The toxigenicity of Clostridium botulinum type C1 is mediated by specific bacteriophages. DNA was extracted from one of these phages. Two DNA fragments, 3 and 7.8 kb, which produced the protein reacting with antitoxin serum were cloned by using bacteriophage lambda gt11 and Escherichia coli. Both DNA fragments were then subcloned into pUC118 plasmids and transferred into E. coli cells. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were analyzed by the dideoxy chain termination method, and their gene products were analyzed by Western immunoblot. The 7.8-kb fragment coded for the entire light chain component and the N terminus of the heavy chain component of the toxin, whereas the 3-kb fragment coded for the remaining heavy chain component. The entire nucleotide sequence for the light chain component was determined, and the derived amino acid sequence was compared with that of tetanus toxin. It was found that the light chain component of C1 toxin possessed several amino acid regions, in addition to the N terminus, that were homologous to tetanus toxin.
TI  - Cloning of a DNA fragment encoding the 5'-terminus of the botulinum type E toxin  gene from Clostridium butyricum strain BL6340.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA was extracted from toxigenic Clostridium butyricum strain BL6340  isolated from a case of infant botulism. After digestion by EcoRI, a DNA fragment of about 1 kbp was cloned into Escherichia coli using lambda gt11, and was subcloned into pUC118. The E. coli cells transformed with this cloned fragment produced a 33 kDa protein which reacted with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the light chain (Lc) component of botulinum type E toxin. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was determined. The sequence was similar to that from botulinum type E toxin gene fragments previously determined by our laboratory (strains Mashike, Otaru and Iwanai). Several highly homologous sequences among the botulinum type A, C, E, butyricum and tetanus toxin genes were found in both translated and untranslated regions. These results suggest that the toxin gene of C. butyricum may have evolved by transfer from C. botulinum.
TI  - The chromosomal integration site of the Streptomyces element pSAM2 overlaps a putative tRNA gene conserved among actinomycetes.
AB  - The pSAM2 element of Streptomyces ambofaciens integrates site-specifically in the genome of different Streptomyces species by recombination between a 58 bp sequence common to the plasmid (attP) and the chromosome (attB). Southern hybridization analysis showed that sequences similar to the pSAM2 attB site were found in other actinomycetes (Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Micromonospora) as well as unrelated bacteria (Bacillus circulans, Escherichia coli, Clostridium botulinum, Bordetella pertussis, and Legionella pneumophila). Hybridizing fragments from B. circulans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of these sequences with the sequence of the integration zone of S. ambofaciens revealed a conserved region of 76 bp which overlapped with the attB site. This conserved sequence was similar to the Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli tRNA(pro1) genes as well as a number of eucaryotic tRNA genes and had a proline-tRNA-like cloverleaf structure. Furthermore, the Streptomyces lividans attB site of the Streptomyces glaucescens element pIJ408 was also found to overlap a potential tRNA gene (tRNA(thr)). We note here that these two putative tRNA genes as well as those which overlap the attB site of the elements SLP1 of Streptomyces coelicolor and pMEA100 of Nocardia mediterranei all contain the site where integrative recombination takes place. These presumptive actinomycete tRNA genes lack the 3' terminal CCA sequence found in most procaryotic tRNA genes.
TI  - The complete sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type A and comparison with other clostridial neurotoxins.
AB  - The seven serologically different botulinum neurotoxins are highly potent protein toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. The activated toxins consist of the toxifying A-subunits (Mr approximately 50,000) linked by a disulfide bond to the receptor-binding BC-subunits (Mr approximately 100,000). We have established the complete sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A; 1,296 amino acid residues, Mr = 149,425) and a partial sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type E (273 amino acid residues) as deduced from the corresponding nucleotide sequences of the chromosomally located structural genes. The promoter of the BoNT/A gene is inactive in Escherichia coli. Primer extension experiments indicated that initiation of transcription of the BoNT/A gene occurred 118 nucleotides upstream from the ATG codon. A comparison of the protein sequence revealed an overall identity of 33.8% to that of tetanus toxin. No significant similarity to other known proteins including ADP-ribosylating toxins could be detected. Three of the six histidine residues of the A-subunit of BoNT/A were found in the peptide sequence H223ELIHXXH230 within a domain of predicted alpha-helical secondary structure. This motif is also found in similar positions of the A-subunits of tetanus toxin and BoNT/E.
TI  - The complete amino acid sequence of the Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin,  deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis of the encoding gene.
AB  - A 26-mer oligonucleotide probe was synthesized (based on the determined amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of the Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin, BoNT/A) and used in Southern blot analysis to construct a restriction map of the region of the clostridial genome encompassing BoNT/A. The detailed information obtained enabled the cloning of the structural gene as three distinct fragments, none of which were capable of directing the expression of a toxic molecule. The central portion was cloned as a 2-kb PvuII-TaqI fragment and the remaining regions of the light chain and heavy chain as a 2.4-kb ScaI-TaqI fragment and a 3.4-kb HpaI-PvuII fragment, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of all three fragments was determined and an open reading frame identified, composed of 1296 codons corresponding to a polypeptide of 149 502 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 33% similarity to tetanus toxin, with the most highly conserved regions occurring between the N-termini of the respective heavy chains. Conservation of Cys residues flanking the position at which the toxins are cleaved to yield the heavy chain and light chain allowed the tentative identification of those residues which probably form the disulphide bridges linking the two toxin subfragments.
TI  - The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of EcoRI fragment containing the  5'-terminal region of Clostridium botulinum type E toxin gene cloned from Mashike, Iwanai and Otaru strains.
AB  - Chromosomal DNAs were extracted from toxigenic three Clostridium botulinum type E strains isolated from food-borne botulism. After digestion by EcoRI, the fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli by using bacteriophage lambda gt11 and screened with monoclonal antibody recognizing the light chain component of botulinum type E toxin. The fragments (about 1 kbp size) cloned from each strain were recloned into a plasmid vector pUC118. The E. coli cells transformed with the recombinant plasmids produced 33 kDa protein with or without IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) which reacted with the monoclonal antibody. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned EcoRI fragments from the three type E strains were identical and contain the 5'-terminal region of the type E toxin gene. It was also found that there exist several highly homologous nucleotide sequences among the botulinum types A, C and E, and tetanus toxin genes in both translated and untranslated regions.
TI  - Characterization of botulinum type A neurotoxin gene: delineation of the N-terminal encoding region.
AB  - A 456 basepair HindIII fragment that encoded a portion of the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene was cloned into Escherichia coli using a plasmid vector. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this botulinum DNA insert encoded an open reading frame of 35 amino acid residues of which 34 corresponded to the N-terminal residues of botulinum neurotoxin type A.
TI  - The rho gene product expressed in E. coli is a substrate of botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3.
AB  - The ras-related rho A protein expressed in E. coli, was ADP-ribosylated by botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3. C3 also modified the valine-14 mutant rho protein but not the products of H-ras, R-ras, ral, ypt, and rap 1 genes. A ras-rho chimaera consisting of 60 amino acids from the amino terminus of ras fused to 133 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of rho was not modified by C3. Antibodies raised against the porcine brain cytosolic substrate of C3 cross reacted with the rho, valine-14 rho and ras-rho proteins, but not with the gene products of H-ras, R-ras, ral or rap 1. Polyclonal anti-H-ras antibodies cross reacted with H-ras but not with ral, rho, or the C3 substrate purified from porcine brain.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Tetanus toxin: primary structure, expression in E. coli, and homology with botulinum toxins.
AB  - A pool of synthetic oligonucleotides was used to identify the gene encoding tetanus toxin on a 75-kbp plasmid from a toxigenic non-sporulating strain of Clostridium tetani. The nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for 1315 amino acids corresponding to a polypeptide with a mol. wt of 150,700. In the mature toxin molecule, proline (2) and serine (458) formed the N termini of the 52,288 mol. wt light chain and the 98,300 mol. wt heavy chain, respectively. Cysteine (467) was involved in the disulfide linkage between the two subchains. The amino acid sequences of the tetanus toxin revealed striking homologies with the partial amino acid sequences of botulinum toxins A, B, and E, indicating that the neurotoxins from C. tetani and C. botulinum are derived from a common ancestral gene. Overlapping peptides together covering the entire tetanus toxin molecule were synthesized in Escherichia coli and identified by monoclonal antibodies. The promoter of the toxin gene was localized in a region extending 322 bp upstream from the ATG codon and was shown to be functional in E. coli.
TI  - [Recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. Proportions of toxins of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the NAD and ADP-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. Thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. The cholera toxin and the L-toxin from Escherichia coli have a similar structure. They transfer an ADP-ribose portion from NAD to the GTP-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the GTPase activity is reduced. The increase of the cAMP content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. The tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. The botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.
TI  - Toxin-producing bacteria in infants. Lack of an association with sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - After finding enterotoxigenic (ET) Escherichia coli in two consecutive cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), we initiated a prospective search for ET E coli in SIDS in Manitoba; in addition, we looked for toxigenic Clostridium botulinum and C difficile. In a 21-month period, small- and large-bowel contents were obtained in 33 cases of SIDS, from 32 control subjects, and in ten suspected cases of SIDS. Neither C botulinum nor ET E coli was isolated from any of these; C difficile was cultured from postmortem bowel contents of two SIDS and seven control cases. The overall isolation rate of C difficile was 17%. Despite the fact that two of these cases had toxin detectable in the bowel contents, no evidence of colitis was found in any of the cases with C difficile. We conclude that C botulinum or ET E coli have only a small role, if any, in the etiology of SIDS, and that C difficile is found relatively commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of infants without apparent local or systemic effects.

TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.

TI  - Seasonal occurrence and distribution of microbial indicators and pathogens in the Rhode River of Chesapeake Bay.
AB  - The seasonal incidence and occurrence of indicator organisms and pathogens were studied at four sites in the Rhode River, a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. The highest frequency of occurrence of total and fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was in Muddy Creek, a marsh area receiving pasture land runoff. Second highest frequency of occurrence of these bacteria was in Cadle Creek, a populated area. Lowest measurements of these parameters were obtained at stations in the central portion of the Rhode River. No Salmonella spp. were detected by the methods employed in this study. However, it is concluded that if these organisms are present, the concentrations are less than or equal to 1 organism per liter. The presence of Clostridium botulinum was detected in 12% of the samples tested.
TI  - Comparison of the effects of three fluorocarbons on certain bacteria.
AB  - Three fluorocarbons were tested to determine their effect on bacterial growth. Freon 11 and 21 in various concentrations had an inhibitory effect on selected test organisms, but Freon 22 had no effect. Both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, as well as gram-positive and gram-negative species, were included among the bacteria tested. Freon 11 and 21 caused a similar response with Freon 11 being more inhibitory to some species and Freon 21 more inhibitory to others. Inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the halocarbon and resulted in decreased respiration rates at all concentrations tested. Results reported here indicate that the action of the fluorocarbons tested is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic, Serratia marcescens and Clostridium botulinum were the species most sensitive to the halocarbons tested.

AB  - Lyophilized, 48-hr log-phase vegetative cells were extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) and ethanol-ether (3:1, v/v) and then saponified with methanolic KOH. Gas-liquid chromatography of the methyl esters of extractable fatty acids revealed distinctive "pattern profiles" of Clostridium botulinum toxigenic types "A," "B," and "E." C. perfringens type "A" and Escherichia coli strain "B" were also studied in a similar manner and were found to give pattern profiles which were distinct even from those obtained for the C. botulinum microorganisms. Amino sugar content of the five microorganisms was determined by using a Beckman amino acid analyzer. The molar ratio of glucosamine to that of galactosamine was found to be of further assistance in distinguishing the individual microorganisms.
