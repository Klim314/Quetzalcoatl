TI  == gut dysbiosis is linked to hypertension.
AB  == emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota is critical in the maintenance of  physiological homeostasis. this study was designed to test the hypothesis that dysbiosis in gut microbiota is associated with hypertension because genetic, environmental, and dietary factors profoundly influence both gut microbiota and blood pressure. bacterial dna from fecal samples of 2 rat models of hypertension  and a small cohort of patients was used for bacterial genomic analysis. we observed a significant decrease in microbial richness, diversity, and evenness in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, in addition to an increased firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio. these changes were accompanied by decreases in acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria. in addition, the microbiota of a small  cohort of human hypertensive patients was found to follow a similar dysbiotic pattern, as it was less rich and diverse than that of control subjects. similar changes in gut microbiota were observed in the chronic angiotensin ii infusion rat model, most notably decreased microbial richness and an increased firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio. in this model, we evaluated the efficacy of oral  minocycline in restoring gut microbiota. in addition to attenuating high blood pressure, minocycline was able to rebalance the dysbiotic hypertension gut microbiota by reducing the firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio. these observations demonstrate that high blood pressure is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, both in animal and human hypertension. they suggest that dietary intervention to  correct gut microbiota could be an innovative nutritional therapeutic strategy for hypertension.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota and type 1 diabetes.
AB  == the role of intestinal microbiota in immune-mediated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, has deservedly received a lot of attention. evidently, changes in the intestinal microbiota are associated with type 1 diabetes as demonstrated by recent studies. children with beta-cell autoimmunity have shown low abundance of  butyrate-producing bacteria and increase in the abundance of members of the bacteroidetes phylum in fecal microbiota. these alterations could explain increased gut permeability, subclinical small intestinal inflammation, and dysregulation of oral tolerance in type 1 diabetes. however, these studies do not provide evidence of the causative role of the gut microbiota in the development of beta-cell autoimmunity, yet. in animal models, the composition of gut microbiota modulates the function of both innate and adaptive immunity, and intestinal bacteria are regulators of autoimmune diabetes. thus, prevention of type 1 diabetes could, in the future, be based on the interventions targeted to the gut microbiota.
