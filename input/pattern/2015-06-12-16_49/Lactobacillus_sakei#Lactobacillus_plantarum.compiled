TI  - The predominance of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis in French organic sourdoughs and its impact on related bread characteristics.
AB  - Fourteen bakeries located in different regions of France were selected. These bakers use natural sourdough and organic ingredients. Consequently, different organic sourdoughs used for the manufacture of French bread were studied by the enumeration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and 16S rRNA sequencing of the isolates. In addition, after DNA extraction the bacterial diversity was assessed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA V1-V3 region. Although LAB counts showed significant variations (7.6-9.5log10CFU/g) depending on the sourdough studied, their identification through a polyphasic approach revealed a large predominance of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis in all samples. In ten sourdoughs, both culture and independent methods identified L. sanfranciscensis as the dominant LAB species identified. In the remaining sourdoughs, culture methods identified 30-80% of the LAB as L. sanfranciscensis whereas more than 95% of the reads obtained by pyrosequencing belonged to L. sanfranciscensis. Other sub-dominant species, such as Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus hammesii, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, and Lactobacillus sakei, were also identified. Quantification of L. sanfranciscensis by real-time PCR confirmed the predominance of this species ranging from 8.24 to 10.38log10CFU/g. Regarding the acidification characteristics, sourdough and related bread physico-chemical characteristics varied, questioning the involvement of sub-dominant species or L. sanfranciscensis intra-species diversity and/or the role of the baker's practices.
TI  - Gene expression of enzymes involved in utilization of xylooligosaccharides by strains.
AB  - Prebiotics are defined as food components that confer health benefits on the host through modulation of the microbiota. Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are non-digestible oligosaccharides that have recently received increasing attention as potential prebiotic candidates. XOS are sugar oligomers composed of 1,4-linked xylopyranosyl backbone and are obtained by either chemical or, more commonly, enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan polysaccharides, extracted from the plant cell wall. The bifidogenic effect of XOS was demonstrated by both in vitro studies and small-scale in vivo human studies. Some intestinal bacterial strains are able to grow on XOS, yet numerous studies have demonstrated that the ability to utilize these oligosaccharides varies considerably among these bacteria. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of several strains Lactobacillus to use XOS. Fifteen Lactobacillus strains, allifiated to L. plantarum, L. brevis and L. sakei, were studied. Screening procedure was performed for the ability of the strains to utilize XOS as an alternative carbon source. Only some of them utilize XOS. The growth kinetics show the presence of two lag phases, indicating that these bacteria utilize probably some monosaccharides present in the used XOS. XOS were fermented with high specificity by Bifidobacteria strains, but Lactobacilli did not metabolize XOS efficiently.
TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of Russia.
AB  - Russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. However, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resources and analyzing the LAB composition of Russian traditional fermented dairy foods. In the present study, we cultured LAB isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from Kalmykiya, Buryats, and Tuva regions of Russia. Seven lactobacillus species and the Bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative PCR. The LAB counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/mL (or per gram). In total, 599 LAB strains were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. The identified LAB belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16S rRNA and murE gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The predominant LAB isolates were Lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. The quantitative PCR results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and Bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (Lactobacillus helveticus in Tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (Lactobacillus acidophilus in Kalmykiya) log cfu/mL of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). The numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Lb. plantarum, Lb. helveticus, and Lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Russia have complex compositions of LAB species. The diversity of LAB might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.
TI  - Differential immune-stimulatory effects of LTAs from different lactic acid bacteria via MAPK signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is an immune-stimulatory component found in the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria, which are a major group of Gram-positive bacteria known to have beneficial health effects in humans. In this study, we evaluated the stimulatory effects of LTAs isolated from different lactobacilli species with mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. METHODS: RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with pLTA (isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum K8), rLTA (isolated from Lactobacillus rhamnosus), dLTA (isolated from Lactobacillus delbreukii), and sLTA (isolated from Lactobacillus sakei K101). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 production were examined by ELISA, and nitric oxide (NO) production was assayed using Griess reaction. The mRNA and protein expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Signaling molecules were also examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: pLTA and rLTA moderately induced TNF-alpha, IL-10, and NO production compared with stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with dLTA and sLTA. Similar results were obtained for the mRNA and protein expression levels of iNOS. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of cells with pLTA or rLTA resulted in minimal phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK while, dLTA and sLTA were strong activators of MAPK signaling. In addition, the glycolipid structure of LTAs was found to be composed of different fatty acid chain groups and lengths. Taken together, these results suggest that the differential immuno-stimulatory effects of LTAs isolated from different lactobacillus species may be related to their different ability to activate the MAPK signaling pathway, which are modulated by a unique glycolipid structure of LTA.
TI  - A polyphasic approach to study the dynamics of microbial population of an organic wheat sourdough during its conversion to gluten-free sourdough.
AB  - To develop a method for organic gluten-free (GF) sourdough bread production, a long-term and original wheat sourdough was refreshed with GF flours. The dynamics of the sourdough microbiota during five months of back-slopping were analyzed by classical enumeration and molecular methods, including PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), multiplex PCR, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The results showed that the yeast counts remained constant, although Saccharomyces cerevisiae, present in the initial wheat sourdough, was no longer detected in the GF sourdough, while lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts increased consistently. In the first phase, which was aimed at obtaining a GF sourdough from wheat sourdough, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, L. plantarum, and L. spicheri were the main LAB species detected. During the second phase, aimed at maintaining the GF sourdough, the L. plantarum and L. spicheri populations decreased whereas L. sanfranciscensis persisted and L. sakei became the predominant species. Multiplex PCRs also revealed the presence of several L. sakei strains in the GF sourdough. In a search for the origin of the LAB species, PCR-TTGE was performed on the flour samples but only L. sanfranciscensis was detected, suggesting a flour origin for this typical sourdough species. Thus, while replacement of the wheat flour by GF flour influenced the sourdough microbiota, some of the original sourdough LAB and yeast species remained in the GF sourdough.
TI  - Different immune regulatory potential of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei isolated from Kimchi.
AB  - It is known that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have many beneficial health effects,  including antioxidative activity and immune regulation. In this study, the immune regulatory effects of Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum, which are found in different types of kimchi, were evaluated. L. sakei and its lipoteichoic acid (LTA) have greater immune stimulating potential in IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha production as compared with L. plantarum in an in vitro condition. On the other hand, L. plantarum is assumed to repress the Th1 immune response in murine experiments. After being injected with LPS, L. plantarum-fed mice maintained a healthier state, and the level of TNF-alpha in their blood was lower than in other bacterial strainfed mice and in the LPS-only control mice. Additionally, IL-12 production was significantly decreased and the production of IL-4 was greatly increased in the splenocytes from L. plantarum-fed mice. Further experiments revealed that the pre-injection of purified LTA from L. plantarum (pLTA), L. sakei (sLTA), and S. aureus (aLTA) decreased TNF-alpha and IL-4 production in LPS-injected mice. Mouse IL-12, however, was significantly increased by aLTA pre-injection. In conclusion, the L. sakei and L. plantarum strains have immune regulation effects, but the effects differ in cytokine production and the regulatory effects of the Th1/Th2 immune response.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial population dynamics during fermentation and storage of Thai fermented sausage according to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  - This study applied restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "mum" Thai fermented sausages during fermentation and storage. A total of 630 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the sausages prepared using 2 methods. In Method 1, after stuffing, the sausages were stored at 30 degrees C for 14 days. In Method 2, after stuffing and storage at 30 degrees C for 3 days, the sausages were vacuum-packed and stored at 4 degrees C until Day 28. The sausages were sampled on Days 0, 3, 14, and 28 for analyses. The 16S rDNA was amplified and digested using restriction enzymes. Of the restriction enzymes evaluated, Dde I displayed the highest discrimination capacity. The LAB were classified and 7 species were identified For Methods 1 and 2, during fermentation, the Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum species were dominant. For Method 2, the proportion of Leuconostoc mesenteroides markedly increased during storage, until L. sakei and Ln. mesenteroides represented the dominant species. The identification of LAB in the sausage samples could facilitate the selection of appropriate microorganisms for candidate starter cultures for future controlled mum production.
TI  - Investigation of reduction and tolerance capability of lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi against nitrate and nitrite in fermented sausage condition.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis KGR3111, Lactobacillus curvatus KGR 2103, Lactobacillus plantarum KGR 5105, and Lactobacillus sakei KGR 4108 isolated from kimchi were investigated for their potential to be used as starter culture for fermented sausages with the capability to reduce and tolerate nitrate/nitrite. The reduction capability of tested strains for nitrate was not dramatic. All tested strains, however, showed the capability to produce nitrite reductase with the reduction amount of 58.46-75.80 mg/l of NO(2)(-). L. brevis and L. plantarum showed nitrate tolerance with the highest number of 8.71 log cfu/ml and 8.81 log cfu/ml, and L. brevis and L. sakei exhibited nitrite tolerance with the highest number of 8.24 log cfu/ml and 8.25 log cfu/ml, respectively. As a result, L. brevis, L. plantarum, and L. sakei isolated from kimchi showed a tolerance against nitrate or nitrite with a good nitrite reduction capability, indicating the satisfaction of one of the selection criteria to be used as starter culture for fermented sausages.
TI  - Causal relationship between microbial ecology dynamics and proteolysis during manufacture and ripening of protected designation of origin (PDO) cheese Canestrato Pugliese.
AB  - Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, community-level physiological profiles determined by the use of Biolog EcoPlates, and proteolysis analyses were used to characterize Canestrato Pugliese Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese. The number of presumptive mesophilic lactococci in raw ewes' milk was higher than that of presumptive mesophilic lactobacilli. The numbers of these microbial groups increased during ripening, showing temporal and numerical differences. Urea-PAGE showed limited primary proteolysis, whereas the analysis of the pH 4.6-soluble fraction of the cheese revealed that secondary proteolysis increased mainly from 45 to 75 days of ripening. This agreed with the concentration of free amino acids. Raw ewes' milk was contaminated by several bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria (68%; mainly Pseudomonas), Firmicutes (30%; mainly Carnobacterium and Lactococcus), Bacteroidetes (0.05%), and Actinobacteria (0.02%). Almost the same microbial composition persisted in the curd after molding. From day 1 of ripening onwards, the phylum Firmicutes dominated. Lactococcus dominated throughout ripening, and most of the Lactobacillus species appeared only at 7 or 15 days. At 90 days, Lactococcus (87.2%), Lactobacillus (4.8%; mainly Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei), and Leuconostoc (3.9%) dominated. The relative utilization of carbon sources by the bacterial community reflected the succession. This study identified strategic phases that characterized the manufacture and ripening of Canestrato Pugliese cheese and established a causal relationship between mesophilic lactobacilli and proteolysis.
TI  - In vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Portuguese fermented meat products.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. Bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. The objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, Enterococcus faecium ST211Ch, and Lactobacillus sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. Auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were recorded for L. sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for L. plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, respectively, and 12.77% for E. faecium ST211Ch. Various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for Listeria monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for E. faecium ATCC 19443 were observed. According to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. In addition, the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs was examined. Production of beta-galactosidase by L. sakei ST22Ch, ST153Ch and ST154Ch, L. plantarum ST202Ch and ST216Ch, and E. faecium ST211Ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranose. A statistically significant (P<0.001) inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by L. plantarum ST202Ch (38.3%) and ST216Ch (48.6%), L. sakei ST153Ch (16.2%) and ST154Ch (16.1%), and E. faecium ST211Ch (21.7%) was observed. As determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.
TI  - Antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  - In this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (including 5 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 Lactobacillus fermentum, 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 Lactobacillus plantarum, 1 Lactobacillus sakei, and 1 Lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, and Aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA). Results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from LAB fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. The inhibition ability of CFS was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees C, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the pH of CFS was adjusted to 6.5. With the exception of L. plantarum NRRL B-4496 and L. acidophilus ATCC-4495, all other LAB strains produced PLA ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mM. The high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial PLA (3.01-36.10mM) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied LAB and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
TI  - Microbial ecology dynamics during rye and wheat sourdough preparation.
AB  - The bacterial ecology during rye and wheat sourdough preparation was described by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Viable plate counts of presumptive lactic acid bacteria, the ratio between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, the rate of acidification, a permutation analysis based on biochemical and microbial features, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and diversity indices all together demonstrated the maturity of the sourdoughs during 5 to 7 days of propagation. Flours were mainly contaminated by metabolically active genera (Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Enterobacter, Erwinia, and Sphingomonas) belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria or Bacteroidetes (genus Chryseobacterium). Their relative abundances varied with the flour. Soon after 1 day of propagation, this population was almost completely inhibited except for the Enterobacteriaceae. Although members of the phylum Firmicutes were present at very low or intermediate relative abundances in the flours, they became dominant soon after 1 day of propagation. Lactic acid bacteria were almost exclusively representative of the Firmicutes by this time. Weissella spp. were already dominant in rye flour and stably persisted, though they were later flanked by the Lactobacillus sakei group. There was a succession of species during 10 days of propagation of wheat sourdoughs. The fluctuation between dominating and subdominating populations of L. sakei group, Leuconostoc spp., Weissella spp., and Lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. Other subdominant species such as Lactobacillus plantarum were detectable throughout propagation. As shown by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominated throughout the sourdough propagation. Notwithstanding variations due to environmental and technology determinants, the results of this study represent a clear example of how the microbial ecology evolves during sourdough preparation.
TI  - Lactobacillus sakei lipoteichoic acid inhibits MMP-1 induced by UVA in normal dermal fibroblasts of human.
AB  - Human skin is continuously exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-induced photoaging. UVA increases the activity of MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, signaling. The irradiation of keratinocytes by UVA results in the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the stimulation of MMP-1 in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a component of the cell wall of gram-positive Lactobacillus spp. of bacteria. LTA is well known as an anti-inflammation molecule. LTA of the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum has an anti-photoaging effect, but the potential anti-photoaging effect of the other bacteria has not been examined to date. The current study showed that L. sakei LTA (sLTA) has an immune modulating effect in human monocyte cells. Our object was whether inhibitory effects of sLTA on MMP-1 are caused from reducing the MAPK signal in NHDFs. It inhibits MMP-1 and MAPK signaling induced by UVA in NHDFs. We also confirmed effects of sLTA suppressing TNF-alpha inducing MMP-1 in NHDFs.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of probiotic properties of Lactobacilli isolated from rat fecal microbiota.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to characterize lactobacilli isolates from the feces of male Wistar rats. Various physiological features of the candidate probiotic isolates were preliminarily investigated, including tolerance to simulated gastric juice and bile salts, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and in vitro aggregation. Based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, four potential probiotic isolates (CS2, CS3, CS4, and CS7) were screened. The isolates showed good tolerance to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts. CS4 and CS7 exhibited strong antibacterial activities against the pathogens tested as assessed in neutral pH culture supernatants. All lactobacilli isolates were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, except vancomycin. Moreover, the isolate CS4 and CS7 were found to possess stronger cell surface traits such as hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation and co-aggregation capacity. In addition, CS4 and CS7 had greater beta-galactosidase activities than the others. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that CS2, CS3, CS4 and CS7 are Lactobacillus intestinalis PJ2, L. sakei PJ3, L. helveticus PJ4, and L. plantarum PJ7, respectively. Based on the obtained results, L. helveticus PJ4 and L. plantarum PJ7 are ideal in vitro probiotic candidates and require further in vivo evaluation.
TI  - Technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  - Technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from Spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. In relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and 52% of the Enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only Lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. Related to safety aspects, E. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, L. sakei strains were the most sensitive. In relation to virulence factors, in the E. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaA gene was detected. The analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most E. faecium strains and L. sakei Al-142 produced tyramine. In conclusion, L. paracasei Al-128 and L. sakei Al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.
TI  - Application' and validation of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starter cultures for controlled leek fermentations and their influence on the antioxidant properties of leek.
AB  - Leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of Belgium's most important outdoor vegetables, mainly cultivated for its white shaft. Fermentation of leek offers opportunities in view of biomass valorization and product diversification. This study deals with the implementation and validation of starter cultures to perform controlled leek fermentations and to ensure a high quality of the end-products. Therefore, a thorough study of the fermentation microbiology and the influence of three starter culture strains (Lactobacillus plantarum IMDO 788, Lactobacillus sakei IMDO 1358, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides IMDO 1347) on the metabolite kinetics of leek fermentation and antioxidant properties of leek was performed. Overall, the application of lactic acid bacteria starter cultures resulted in a fast prevalence of the species involved, coupled to an accelerated acidification. Of the three starter cultures tested, the mixed starter culture of L. plantarum IMDO 788 and L. mesenteroides IMDO 1347 was most promising, as its application resulted in fermented leek of good microbiological quality and in a more extensive carbohydrate consumption, whereby diverse end-metabolites were produced. However, high residual fructose concentrations allowed yeast outgrowth, resulting in increased ethanol and glycerol concentrations, and indicated the lack of a prevailing strictly heterofermentative LAB species. The antioxidant capacity of fermented leek samples, as measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay, increased when starter cultures were used, whereas with regard to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, only leek fermented with L. sakei IMDO 1358 scored higher than spontaneously fermented leek. The total phenolic content was not influenced by the use of starter cultures, while the S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides content decreased strongly. A preliminary sensory analysis revealed that the spontaneously fermented leek and the one obtained with the mixed starter culture were preferred by consumers, emphasizing again the importance of microbial successions in vegetable fermentations.
TI  - Catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  - Metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". The metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. In this review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. The genus Lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. They are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. Indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT; including the mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine). Here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species with a proven ability to adapt to the GIT. As examples this review concentrates on the following species - Lb. plantarum, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. ruminis, Lb. salivarius, Lb. reuteri and Lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.
TI  - Species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  - Leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of Belgium's most important vegetables. All or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. Therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. This study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added NaCl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. The combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated LAB species. Both added NaCl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. By that time, glucose and fructose, the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. A sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected standard strains of lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins--pilot study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this paper, an attempt was made to evaluate the antibacterial potential of standard strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing bacteriocins of various classes, thus demonstrating various mechanisms of cell membrane damages against the Streptococcus agalactiae strains (Group B Streptococcus, GBS), depending on surface polysaccharides and surface alpha-like protein genes. MATERIALS/METHODS: Antimicrobial property of the strains of L. plantarum C 11, L. sakei DSMZ 6333, and L. lactis ATCC 11454 producing bacteriocins: JK and EF plantaricins, sakacin and nisin, respectively, against the GBS strains was evaluated. The chosen to the study GBS strains were represented by serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, V and they had bca, epsilon, rib, alp2 or alp3 alpha-like protein genes. The experiment was conducted by means of suspension culture and the bacteria count was determined using the serial dilution method. RESULTS: A great ability of L. plantarum C 11 strain was proven to inhibit the GBS growth. The strain of L. sakei DSMZ 6333 did not demonstrate any ability to inhibit the growth of GBS, whereas L. lactis ATCC 11454 inhibited the growth of S. agalactiae indicator strains to a minor extent. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the GBS strains representing various serotypes against the antimicrobial activity of model LAB strains. The least sensitive to the activity of bacteriocins were the strains representing serotypes Ib and III, whereas the strains representing serotype II were the most sensitive. The sensitivity of the GBS strains to the antimicrobial activity of LAB was not dependent on alpha-like protein genes. DISCUSSION: Among the LAB standard strains producing bacteriocins, the strongest antimicrobial property was observed in the strain of L. plantarum C 11. Because of the generally known and verified strong antagonistic property of the strains of L. plantarum species against indicator bacteria, it is necessary to further pursue the research presented in this paper.
TI  - Production potency of folate, vitamin B(12), and thiamine by lactic acid bacteria isolated from Japanese pickles.
AB  - We investigated the extracellular production of folate, vitamin B(12), and thiamine in cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from nukazuke, a traditional Japanese pickle, and the relationships between the vitamin production and such properties of LAB as tolerance to salts, ethanol, etc. Among the 180 isolates of LAB, two strains of Lactobacillus (Lb.) sakei and a strain of Lb. plantarum extracellularly produced high levels of folate (about 100 microg/L). A strain of Lb. coryniformis and one of Lb. plantarum produced about 2 microg/L of vitamin B(12), although the level was not high. No isolates produced a high level of thiamine. The type cultures of LBA (53 strains) did not show any higher production of these vitamins. Some isolates showed tolerance to high concentrations of salts and alcohol, and low initial pH. No significant relationships between folate or vitamin B(12) productions and these properties of LAB were apparent.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - Lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan. However, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. In this study, LAB from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. A total of 196 LAB were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. These isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (A to H) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. On the other hand, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. A potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. In addition, seven L. plantarum and five W. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T). This is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of LAB existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.
TI  - Construction of a food-grade cloning vector for Lactobacillus plantarum and its utilization in a food model.
AB  - The development of Lactobacillus plantarum to be used in starter cultures in the  food industry has been limited because of the lack of a food-grade cloning vector for the bacterium. In this study, the plasmid pFLP1 was constructed by joining 2 DNA fragments derived from food-approved organisms. The 5.2-kb BamHI/KpnI DNA fragment of pRV566 containing the theta-type replicon of Lactobacillus sakei was ligated to the BamHI/KpnI DNA fragment of a 2.9-kb lactococcal cadmium resistance determinant amplified from pND918. The 8.1-kb newly constructed plasmid could transform L. plantarum N014, a bacteriocin-producing bacteria originally isolated from nham, a traditional Thai fermented sausage. The resulting transformant, L. plantarum N014-FLP, and its parent strain were shown to be very similar in growth rate and bacteriocin activity. In addition, the plasmid was very stable in its host bacteria under nonselective pressure for 100 generations in MRS medium and for 5 days in a nham model. These results suggest that pFLP1 is a potential food-grade cloning vector for L. plantarum.
TI  - Survival of silage lactic acid bacteria in the goat gastrointestinal tract as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the survival rate of silage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the  ruminant gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wilted Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage (containing 1.9 x 10(6) CFU LAB g(-1)) was fed ad libitum to three goats equipped with rumen cannulae. Silage was given alone or with concentrates at a 1 : 1 ratio on a dry matter basis. Rumen fluid was then obtained 2, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to compare LAB communities in silage, rumen fluid and faeces. The LAB detected in the wilted silage included Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus murinus and Lactobacillus sakei. Bands indicative of Lact. murinus were detected in either the rumen fluid or faeces, whereas the bands indicative of Lact. plantarum, Lact. brevis and Lact. sakei were not. Although the rumen fluid LAB counts and volatile fatty acid concentrations were higher in goats fed silage plus concentrates compared with those fed silage alone, the LAB communities themselves remained unaffected. Sampling times and goat-to-goat variations did not affect the LAB communities found in the rumen fluid. CONCLUSION: LAB communities found in the gut are not remarkably affected by the consumption of silage LAB, even when the silage is accompanied by concentrates that facilitate gut fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although silage can improve probiotic function, it may be difficult for silage LAB to survive the digestive process in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Strain-level characterization of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in Norvegia cheese by high-resolution melt analysis.
AB  - The nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) constitute an important microbial group found during cheese ripening and they are thought to be fundamental to the quality of cheese. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for NSLAB are important for cheese quality control and in understanding the cheese ripening process. Here, we present a novel rapid approach for strain-level characterization through combined 16S rRNA gene and repetitive sequence-based high-resolution melt analysis (HRM). The approach was demonstrated through the characterization of 94 isolates from Norvegia, a Gouda-type cheese. The HRM profiles of the V1 and V3 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolates were compared with the HRM profiles of 13 reference strains. The HRM profile comparison of the V1 and V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene allowed discrimination of isolates and reference strains. Among the cheese isolates, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (62 isolates) and Lactobacillus plantarum/Lactobacillus pentosus (27 isolates) were the dominant species, whereas Lactobacillus curvatus/Lactobacillus sakei were found occasionally (5 isolates). The HRM profiling of repetitive sequence-based PCR using the (GTG)(5) primer was developed for strain-level characterization. The clustering analysis of the HRM profiles showed high discriminatory power, similar to that of cluster analysis based on the gel method. In conclusion, the HRM approach in this study may be applied as a fast, accurate, and reproducible method for characterization of the NSLAB microflora in cheese and may be applicable to other microbial environments following selective plate culturing.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional pickles in Sichuan, China.
AB  - The pickle, a traditional fermented vegetable product, is popular in Sichuan Province of China. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in pickles by analyzing 36 samples collected from 6 different regions in Sichuan Province. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.90 to 8.40 log cfu ml(-1). In total, 185 presumptive LAB with Gram-positive and catalase-negative properties were obtained from these samples using MRS agar, and those strains were identified at the species level by physiological tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The results revealed that all isolates were accurately identified as Enterococcus thailandicus (2 strains), Lactobacillus alimentarius (16 strains), L. brevis (24 strains), L. paracasei (9 strains), L. plantarum (81 strains), L. pentosus (38 strains), L. sakei (8 strains), L. spicheri (1 strain), Leuconostoc lactis (1 strain) and Pediococcus ethanolidurans (5 strains). The predominant LAB in Sichuan pickle was L. plantarum, which were isolated from most samples. The results also demonstrated that different regions in Sichuan Province have complex compositions of LAB species, and such a rich resource of LAB strains provides raw data for further studies involving probiotic strain selection.
TI  - Evaluation of the probiotic potential and effect of encapsulation on survival for Lactobacillus plantarum ST16Pa isolated from papaya.
AB  - Capability to produce antilisterial bacteriocins by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be explored by the food industry as a tool to increase the safety of foods. Furthermore, probiotic activity of bacteriogenic LAB brings extra advantages to these strains, as they can confer health benefits to the consumer. Beneficial effects depend on the ability of the probiotic strains to maintain viability in the food during shelf-life and to survive the natural defenses of the host and multiply in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This study evaluated the probiotic potential of a bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strain (Lb. plantarum ST16Pa) isolated from papaya fruit and studied the effect of encapsulation in alginate on survival in conditions simulating the human GIT. Good growth of Lb. plantarum ST16Pa was recorded in MRS broth with initial pH values between 5.0 and 9.0 and good capability to survive in pH 4.0, 11.0 and 13.0. Lb. plantarum ST16Pa grew well in the presence of oxbile at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 3.0%. The level of auto-aggregation was 37%, and various degrees of co-aggregation were observed with different strains of Lb. plantarum, Enterococcus spp., Lb. sakei and Listeria, which are important features for probiotic activity. Growth was affected negatively by several medicaments used for human therapy, mainly anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics. Adhesion to Caco-2 cells was within the range reported for other probiotic strains, and PCR analysis indicated that the strain harbored the adhesion genes mapA, mub and EF-Tu. Encapsulation in 2, 3 and 4% alginate protected the cells from exposure to 1 or 2% oxbile added to MRS broth. Studies in a model simulating the transit through the GIT indicated that encapsulated cells were protected from the acidic conditions in the stomach but were less resistant when in conditions simulating the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and first section of the colon. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a bacteriocinogenic LAB isolated from papaya that presents application in food biopreservation and may be beneficial to the consumer health due to its potential probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Influence of artisan bakery- or laboratory-propagated sourdoughs on the diversity of lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiotas.
AB  - Seven mature type I sourdoughs were comparatively back-slopped (80 days) at artisan bakery and laboratory levels under constant technology parameters. The cell density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria and related biochemical features were not affected by the environment of propagation. On the contrary, the number of yeasts markedly decreased from artisan bakery to laboratory propagation. During late laboratory propagation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that the DNA band corresponding to Saccharomyces cerevisiae was no longer detectable in several sourdoughs. Twelve species of lactic acid bacteria were variously identified through a culture-dependent approach. All sourdoughs harbored a certain number of species and strains, which were dominant throughout time and, in several cases, varied depending on the environment of propagation. As shown by statistical permutation analysis, the lactic acid bacterium populations differed among sourdoughs propagated at artisan bakery and laboratory levels. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Weissella cibaria dominated in only some sourdoughs back-slopped at artisan bakeries, and Leuconostoc citreum seemed to be more persistent under laboratory conditions. Strains of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis were indifferently found in some sourdoughs. Together with the other stable species and strains, other lactic acid bacteria temporarily contaminated the sourdoughs and largely differed between artisan bakery and laboratory levels. The environment of propagation has an undoubted influence on the composition of sourdough yeast and lactic acid bacterium microbiotas.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  - In order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 LAB strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. According to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups, including Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus acidipiscis, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. coryniformis subsp. torquens, L. curvatus, L. paraplantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella hellenica, Weissella paramesenteroides and Carnobacterium divergens. This is the first report to document that C. divergens, L. acidipiscis, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. garvieae, phenotypically novel L. lactis subsp. cremoris, E. gallinarum and W. hellenica are present in vegetative forage crops. L. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. Some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth pH and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. These results are useful in understanding the diversity of LAB associated with decayed silage of timothy and orchardgrass.
TI  - Heterologous expression of Oenococcus oeni malolactic enzyme in Lactobacillus plantarum for improved malolactic fermentation.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum is involved in a multitude of food related industrial fermentation processes including the malolactic fermentation (MLF) of wine. This work is the first report on a recombinant L. plantarum strain successfully conducting MLF. The malolactic enzyme (MLE) from Oenococcus oeni was cloned into the lactobacillal expression vector pSIP409 which is based on the sakacin P operon of Lactobacillus sakei and expressed in the host strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Both recombinant and wild-type L. plantarum strains were tested for MLF using a buffered malic acid solution in absence of glucose. Under the conditions with L-malic acid as the only energy source and in presence of Mn2+ and NAD+, the recombinant L. plantarum and the wild-type strain converted 85% (2.5 g/l) and 51% (1.5 g/l), respectively, of L-malic acid in 3.5 days. Furthermore, the recombinant L. plantarum cells converted in a modified wine 15% (0.4 g/l) of initial L-malic acid concentration in 2 days. In conclusion, recombinant L. plantarum cells expressing MLE accelerate the malolactic fermentation.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Italian ryegrass silage.
AB  - Twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from three cultivars (Akiaoba, Nagahahikari and Tachiwase) of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and rapid PCR-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. We successfully identified both at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and Pediococcus parvulus. This is the first report to elucidate the presence of Lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in Italian ryegrass silages. Physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth pH and temperature. These results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in Taiwan. The microflora of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. In this study, LAB from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 103 LAB were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from its raw substrate, cucumber. These isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (A-G) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Weissella cibaria and Weissella hellenica. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 Lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Heterofermentative W. cibaria and Leu. lactis were the major LAB found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. In soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative L. pentosus and L. plantarum were the most abundant LAB. In addition, the results also suggested that HhaI and RsaI restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish W. hellenica and Weissella paramesenteroides.
TI  - Combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  - In this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sucuk a Turkish fermented dry sausage. On the one hand, the PCR-DGGE method targetting the V1 and V3 regions of 16S DNA was applied to DNA that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. On the other hand, rep-PCR fingerprinting was performed for the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region. As a result of the PCR-DGGE analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. The culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the Lactobacillus genera including Lb. sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. curvatus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus farciminis and Lactobacillus alimentarius. However, Leuconostoc and Weisella were also detected as minor genera. Again, Lactococcus piscium, Weissella halotolerans, Staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated Staphylococcus piscifermentans/Staphylococcus condimenti/Staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while Lb. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. In the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of LAB communities in fermented food products.
TI  - In vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. The selected bacteria include strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus farciminis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Viable counts after simulated gastric transit tolerance showed that L. reuteri strains and P. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas L. pentosus, L. farciminis and L. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. All strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. The bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. Overall, L. plantarum MF1298 and three L. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. All strains, both living and UV-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function. However, living L. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) from 6 to 24h. This work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. Overall, L. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.
TI  - [Microbial diversity of a community for ensiling rice straw at low temperature and fermentation dynamics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To accelerate the conversion of rice straw into feeds in the low-temperature region, a microbial community was constructed by continuous enrichment cultivation. Microbial diversity and dynamics during the fermentation at 10 degrees C was analyzed. METHODS: The community was selected at 5 degrees C under static condition. To analyze the inoculating effects, the community and commercial inoculant ( CI: composed of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, L. salivarilus, Pediococcus acidilactici) were respectively inoculated into the rice straw for 30 d fermentation at 10 degrees C. Fermented products were detected by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Composition microorganisms of the community were analyzed using cloning library. Microbial dynamics during the fermentation was detected by denatured gradient gel eletrophoresis (DGGE). Quantitative PCR was used for tracking the composition microorganisms of the community during the fermentation. RESULTS: The results from 16S rDNA cloning library showed that the community was mainly composed of Lactobacillus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. At 6d fermentation, the pH and the lactic acid bacterial colony forming units (LAB CFUs) in the fermented rice straw with the community amounted to 4.3 and 2.9 x 10(9) CFU/g fresh matter (FM), respectively. The pH and LAB CFUs with the CI were respectively 5.3 and 2.9 x 10(9) CFU/g FM. At 30 d fermentation, the lactic acid concentrations with the community and the CI were respectively 8.1 g/kg FM and 2.0 g/kg FM. From DGGE patterns, both L. sakei and Leuconostoc inhae of the community were detected at 6d fermentation and existed during the fermentation. For the treatment with the CI, the uncultured bacterium was detected at 6d fermentation besides the composition microorganisms of the CI. At 16d and 30d fermentation, only L. plantarum and E. faecium were detected. Quantitative PCR showed DNA mass of L. sakei amounted to 41.0% at 6d fermentation in the treatment with the community. At 16d, DNA mass of L. sakei was 65%. The highest value (5.5%) of DNA mass of Le inhae appeared at 6d of fermentation. CONCLUSION: The community could effectively colonize into the rice straw fermentation system and accelerate the fermentation process at low temperature. The dominating microorganism of the community was L. sakei at 10 degrees C.
TI  - Chitinase from Bacillus licheniformis DSM13: expression in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 and biochemical characterisation.
AB  - The gene chi, coding for a GH18 chitinase from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 (ATCC 14580), was cloned into the inducible lactobacillal expression vectors pSIP403 and pSIP409, derived from the sakacin-P operon of Lactobacillus sakei, and expressed in the host strain Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. Both the complete chi gene including the original bacillal signal sequence as well as the mature chi gene were compared, however, no extracellular chitinase activity was detected with any of the constructs. The chitinase gene was expressed intracellularly as an active enzyme with these different systems, at levels of approximately 5mg of recombinant protein per litre of cultivation medium. Results obtained for the two different expression vectors that only differ in the promoter sequence were well comparable. To further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant, His-tagged chitinase Chi was purified from cell extracts of L. plantarum and characterised. The monomeric 65-kDa enzyme can degrade both chitin and chitosan, and shows properties that are very similar to those reported for the native chitinase purified from other B. licheniformis isolates. It shows good thermostability (half lives of stability of 20 and 8.4 days at 37 and 50 degrees C, respectively), and good stability in the pH range of 5-10. The results presented lead the way to overproduction of chitinase in a food-grade system, which is of interest for the food and feed industry.
TI  - Characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of Taiwan.
AB  - To investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (Tet-R) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of Tet-R lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2 x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) CFU/cm(2). From these samples, a total of 159 isolates of Tet-R lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus letivazi. Based on the EFSA (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after MIC analysis, were qualified as Tet-R, from which the significant high Tet-R MIC(50) and MIC(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of Tet-R lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. PCR-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (W), followed by tet (M), (L), (K), and (Q). Their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. Noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different MIC values. Furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates by REP-PCR demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).
TI  - Linoleate isomerase activity occurs in lactic acid bacteria strains and is affected by pH and temperature.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to convert linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA) to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA), respectively. To assess pH and temperature influences on CLA and CLNA production by Lactobacillus sakei LMG 13558. METHODS AND RESULTS: A screening of 48 LAB yielded one Lactobacillus curvatus, five Lactobacillus plantarum and four Lact. sakei strains displaying linoleate isomerase (LAI) activity. CLNA conversion percentages varied largely (1-60%). CLA conversion, occurring in three strains, was lower (2-5%). The LAI gene sequences of the ten LAI-positive strains shared 75-99% identity with the LAI gene sequence of a Lact. plantarum AS1.555. At pH 6.2, CLA and CLNA production by Lact. sakei LMG 13558 was higher at 30 degrees C than at 20 and 25 degrees C. At pH 5.5 (30 degrees C) or 37 degrees C (pH 6.2), LA was not converted and alpha-LNA only slightly converted. CONCLUSIONS: LAB show strain-dependent LAI activity. Production of CLA and CLNA is affected by pH and temperature, as shown for Lact. sakei LMG 13558. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several LAB produce CLA and/or CLNA, as shown for Lact. sakei and Lact. curvatus for the first time. These findings offer potential for the manufacturing of fermented functional foods.
TI  - Prevalence and impact of single-strain starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria on metabolite formation in sourdough.
AB  - Flavour of type II sourdoughs is influenced by the ingredients, processing conditions, and starter culture composition. It is, however, not fully clear to what extent different sourdough lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contribute to flavour. Therefore, two types of flour (rye and wheat) and different LAB starter culture strains were used to prepare sourdoughs, thereby leaving the yeast microbiota uncontrolled. All LAB starter culture strains tested were shown to be prevalent and to acidify the flour/water mixture to pH values between 3.1 and 3.9 after 24h of fermentation. Multiple aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids were produced by the sourdough-associated microbiota throughout the fermentation period. Based on the organoleptic evaluation of breads produced with these sourdoughs, five LAB strains were selected to perform prolonged wheat and rye fermentations as to their capacity to result in an acidic (Lactobacillus fermentum IMDO 130101, Lactobacillus plantarum IMDO 130201, and Lactobacillus crustorum LMG 23699), buttermilk-like (Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471), or fruity flavour (Lactobacillus sakei CG1). Upon prolonged fermentation, higher metabolite concentrations were produced. For instance, L. sakei CG1 produced the highest amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, which was further converted into 3-methylbutyl acetate. The latter compound resulted in a fruity banana flavour after 48h of fermentation, probably due to yeast interference. Rye fermentations resulted in sourdoughs richer in volatiles than wheat, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and ethyl acetate.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from yan-jiang (fermented  ginger), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yan-jiang (fermented ginger) is a popular traditional fermented food  in Taiwan. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora in yan-jiang has not been studied in detail. In this study, LAB from yan-jiang were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 176 LAB were isolated; 160 cultures were isolated from yan-jiang samples and 16 cultures were isolated from raw ginger. These isolates were characterised phenotypically and then divided into nine groups (A to I) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Lactobacillus sakei and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the major LAB found in the initial 2 days of fermentation without pickled plums; these species were mostly replaced by Weissella cibaria and L. plantarum after 3 days of fermentation. In the fermentation bucket with added pickled plums, W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found during fermentation. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined. Twenty-four Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and 19 W. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain L. sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that various LAB species were more numerous when fermentation was carried out without pickled plums. LAB also had effects on the aroma and flavour of yan-jiang.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  - In this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. The fermentations were initiated by the spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions (A and B). Sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. The composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques. Overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Kazachstania and Candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. Buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative LAB, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. However, the spontaneous fermentation of the GF flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc holzapfelii, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus graminis and Weissella cibaria. In general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst Lactobacillus plantarum dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. Lactobacillus pontis is described for the first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. Among yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely Kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition A. This study allowed the identification and isolation of LAB and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. Representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to GF bread production.
TI  - Diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal Lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with BMI and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. The BMI (P < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (P < 0.01 by bacteriology; P < 0.001 by real-time PCR) were higher in the elderly. The number of species in adults was lower (P < 0.05), who were more often colonised with Lactobacillus acidophilus (P = 0.031) and L. helveticus (P < 0.001). In contrast, L. plantarum (P = 0.035), L. paracasei (P < 0.001) and L. reuteri (P = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. L. rhamnosus was detected in adults (P < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. BMI was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (P = 0.008). The higher BMI in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and L. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. Plasma glucose values were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with colonisation with L. paracasei (P = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with L. fermentum (P = 0.052) in the elderly. Thus, the species-specific PCR analysis of Lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. The higher counts of intestinal Lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher BMI and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effect of probiotics enriched diets on Uronema marinum infected  olive flounder.
AB  - The effect of five probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus sakei, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as individual and mixed enriched diet on the seasonal prevalence, activity and intensity of Uronema marinum infection in olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus is reported. The growth performance, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response of U. marinum infected olive flounder on week 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were quantified. The prevalence and infection intensity reached a peak from June to December and then it declined from December to March. The scuticocidal activity in the serum was significantly higher when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae diets on weeks 2-8. All enriched diets significantly enhanced the weight gain significantly between week 6 and 8; the feed efficiency registered a significantly increase from week 4 to 8 when compared to infected fish fed with control diet. Infected fish fed with L. plantarum-supplemented diet had higher survival rate than with other enriched diets. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) and alanine aminotransferase (GPT) levels significantly increased when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus or S. cerevisiae-supplemented diet. Total protein (TP) and glucose (GLU) level significantly increased with any enriched diet from week 4 to 8. The superoxide anion production and serum lysozyme activity registered a significant increase when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae-supplemented diet from week 4-8. The present study concludes that L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae-supplemented diets act as immunostimulants enhancing the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response in U. marinum infected olive flounder.
TI  - A novel vector for lactic acid bacteria that uses a bile salt hydrolase gene as a potential food-grade selection marker.
AB  - A novel vector pM4aB for lactic acid bacterial was developed using a bile salt hydrolase gene from Lactobacillus plantarum as a potential food-grade selection marker. The 3.0-kb pM4aB consisted of the replicon of Lactobacillus plasmid pM4, a multiple cloning site and the bsh gene, which was constructed by elimination of a 5.5-kb non-food-grade DNA fragment from an 8.5-kb intermediate vector pBEmpM4aB. For electroporation into Lactobacillus paracasei X9, a high transformation efficiency of 4.0+/-1.0x10(4) CFU/mug plasmid DNA was yielded with 0.1% (wt/vol) glycodeoxycholic acid sodium selection. A high segregation stability of the vector was also observed as only 0.1% plasmid was lost after 50 generations of growth without selection pressure. The application potential of pM4aB was further confirmed by expression of a catalase gene from Lactobacillus sakei in L. paracasei. These results revealed that the novel vector pM4aB constructed in this study would be a useful tool for genetic modification of the industrially important LAB.
TI  - Functional properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, a traditional Korean fermented vegetable product generally consumed raw as a side-dish with practically every meal. Twelve mild acid producing facultatively heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains were selected for their potential as starter cultures for fermentation of kimchi, and evaluated for their functional properties. Eleven strains were identified as Lactobacillus sakei and one as Lactobacillus plantarum. The strains identified as L. sakei differed in some physiological features; of particular interest was the fact that 9 of these strains produced L(+) lactic acid from glucose in presence of acetate. All strains were able to survive gastrointestinal conditions simulating stomach and duodenum passage. In addition, they showed higher adherence to HT-29 cells than Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a commercial probiotic strain used worldwide. These strains also showed antimicrobial activity against a number of food-borne pathogens. Their ability to lower cholesterol was demonstrated by BSH (bile salt hydrolytic) activity, and cholesterol assimilation tests in vitro. The results suggest the probiotic potential of these strains for use in kimchi fermentation.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Evaluation of different starter cultures (Staphylococci plus Lactic Acid Bacteria) in semi-ripened Salami stuffed in swine gut.
AB  - The ripening properties were evaluated in semi-ripened pork Salami started by different cultures: CXP (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus carnosus); RAP (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, S. xylosus and S. carnosus); and GY2 (L. sakei, S. xylosus and S. carnosus). These starters were chosen by their technological activities: CXP (rapid acidifying); RAP (medium acidifying); and GY2 (slow acidifying plus intense reddening-flavouring). Salami was enhanced with Ponceau 4R red and sodium glutamate, stuffed in pig gut and aged for 12 days at 15 degrees C/65-85%RH. Dehydration, reddening, proteolysis, fat acidity and lipid oxidation were hardly affected by the starters. Acidification by LAB strongly influenced the flavour. L. sakei plus L. plantarum provided a better flavouring than a low dose of L. sakei, and, especially, than over-acidifying P. pentosaceus. A final pH of 5 seems to be suitable for preventing aroma and taste defects in semi-ripened Salami. Spontaneous lactic microflora showed great acidifying potential.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in Taiwan.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from ripe mulberries collected in Taiwan. Ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of Taiwan. Eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (A to D). Weissella cibaria was the most abundant type of LAB distributed in four mulberry farms, and Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in the remaining farm. Ten W. cibaria and one Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T). These results suggest that various LAB are distributed in ripe mulberries and W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found in this study.
TI  - Coexpression of bile salt hydrolase gene and catalase gene remarkably improves oxidative stress and bile salt resistance in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) encounter various types of stress during industrial processes and gastrointestinal transit. Catalase (CAT) and bile salt hydrolase (BSH) can protect bacteria from oxidative stress or damage caused by bile salts by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or deconjugating the bile salts, respectively. Lactobacillus casei is a valuable probiotic strain and is often deficient in both CAT and BSH. In order to improve the resistance of L. casei to both oxidative and bile salts stress, the catalase gene katA from L. sakei and the bile salt hydrolase gene bsh1 from L. plantarum were coexpressed in L. casei HX01. The enzyme activities of CAT and BSH were 2.41 mumol H(2)O(2)/min/10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) and 2.11 mumol glycine/min/ml in the recombinant L. casei CB, respectively. After incubation with 8 mM H(2)O(2), survival ratio of L. casei CB was 40-fold higher than that of L. casei CK. Treatment of L. casei CB with various concentrations of sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) showed that ~10(5) CFU/ml cells survived after incubation with 0.5% GDCA, whereas almost all the L. casei CK cells were killed when treaded with 0.4% GDCA. These results indicate that the coexpression of CAT and BSH confers high-level resistance to both oxidative and bile salts stress conditions in L. casei HX01.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria involved in the spoilage of pasteurized "foie gras" products.
AB  - The spoiling microflora of a re-packaged French "foie gras" product was studied.  A total of 54 isolates, originating from two different factories, were identified using phenotypical and molecular methods (partial 16S rDNA sequencing). Weissella viridescens was the main species detected in the products from factory 1 (64% of the isolates). These products had a low lactic acid concentration and were considered as non-spoiled. The microflora of factory 2 was dominated mainly by the genus Lactobacillus (95% of the isolates), and the high lactic acid concentration of these products was linked with a strong spoilage. Among the 30 Lactobacillus strains, three species were predominant: Lactobacillus sakei (nine isolates), Lactobacillus coryniformis (eight isolates) and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (five isolates). Challenge tests were performed to confirm the involvement of the Lactobacillus strains in the spoilage of the product. Sterile "foie gras" samples were inoculated with 14 LAB strains from the collection. The most acidifying strains belonged to the species L. sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum and L. paraplantarum. This confirmed the role of the strains from the Lactobacillus genus as the main spoilers of "foie gras" products and will be useful to design new quality protocols and extend the shelf-life of these products.
TI  - Differential suppression of heat-killed lactobacilli isolated from kimchi, a Korean traditional food, on airway hyper-responsiveness in mice.
AB  - RATIONALE: Probiotics have been shown to be effective in reducing allergic symptoms. However, there are few studies to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lactobacilli on allergen-induced airway inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether three heat-killed lactobacilli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei, isolated from kimchi, exerted inhibitory effects on airway hyper-responsiveness in a murine asthma model. METHODS: Heat-killed lactic acid bacteria were orally administered into BALB/c mice, followed by challenge with aerosolized ovalbumin, after which allergic symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: Airway inflammation was suppressed in the L. plantarum- and L. curvatus-treated mice. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 levels were significantly lower in the L. plantarum- and L. curvatus-treated mice than in those treated with L. sakei subsp. sakei. Importantly, heat-killed L. plantarum administration induced Foxp3 expression in intestinal lamina propria cells, and heat-killed L. curvatus induced IL-10 as a way of inducing tolerance. CONCLUSION: Specific strains of lactobacilli isolated from kimchi can effectively suppress airway hyper-responsiveness.
TI  - Distribution of aminogenic activity among potential autochthonous starter cultures for dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Any bacterial strain to be used as starter culture should have suitable characteristics, including a lack of amino acid decarboxylase activity. In this study, the decarboxylase activity of 76 bacterial strains, including lactic acid bacteria and gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, was investigated. These strains were previously isolated from European traditional fermented sausages to develop autochthonous starter cultures. Of all the strains tested, 48% of the lactic acid bacteria strains and 13% of gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci decarboxylated one or more amino acids. Aminogenic potential was strain dependent, although some species had a higher proportion of aminogenic strains than did others. Thus, all Lactobacillus curvatus strains and 70% of Lactobacillus brevis strains had the capacity to produce tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine. Some strains also produced other aromatic amines, such as tryptamine and the diamines putrescine and cadaverine. All the enterococcal strains tested were decarboxylase positive, producing high amounts of tyramine and considerable amounts of beta-phenylethylamine. None of the staphylococcal strains had tyrosine-decarboxylase activity, but some produced other amines. From the aminogenic point of view, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Staphylococcus xylosus strains would be the most suitable for use as autochthonous starter cultures for traditional fermented sausages.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of selected lactic acid bacteria for improved processing of Nem chua, a traditional fermented meat from Vietnam.
AB  - Nem chua is a traditional lactic acid fermented meat of Vietnam that is consumed  raw. During fermentation, the number of acid-producing bacteria increased significantly and by the final day (4th), it had reached approximately 8.4 log cfu/g, contributing to 94% of the total microbiota of the product. Out of 85 isolates obtained from the product, only 44 were confirmed Gram-positive and catalase-negative. These putative LAB isolates were purified and screened for antimicrobial and proteolytic activity. None of the isolates showed bacteriocin activity using the 'spot-on lawn' method, but showed antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus sakei and Enterococcus faecium using deferred assay. Four isolates showed good proteolytic activities at pH 7.0. These isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum using an API 50 CHL i.d. kit. Sequencing of the partial 16S rRNA gene amplified by primers 1101F (5'-AACGAGCGCAACCC-3') and 1407R (5'-GACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3') showed 98% homology to Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
TI  - Microbiota analysis of Caspian Sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in Japan.
AB  - We analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, Caspian Sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in Japanese), circulated in Japan. We collected six varieties from five localities. Lactococcus (L) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) CFU/g. We show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. From analysis of the RAPD pattern of 60 bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. Furthermore, PFGE analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. This suggests these L. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in Caspian Sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in Japan. In addition, Lactobacillus (L.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; L. plantarum, Gluconoacetobacter sacchari and Acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and L. paracasei, L. kefiri, Leuconostoc (Leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.
TI  - The abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
AB  - The Abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from Lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from Streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. By modifying the profile hidden Markov model used to select Abi proteins in the Pfam protein family database, we show that this family is larger than presently recognized. Using bacteriocin-associated Abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in Gram-positive bacteria. One such locus, from Lactobacillus sakei 23K, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkAB) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (skkI) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Similar investigation of the Abi gene plnI and the Abi-like gene plnL from L. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (PlnEF and PlnJK, respectively). Interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of SkkI, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.
TI  - High-level expression of Lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in Lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system NICE.
AB  - In this work the overlapping genes (lacL and lacM) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri , Lb. acidophilus , Lb. sakei , and Lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (NICE) vectors and expressed using Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and NZ3900 as hosts. The lacL gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA. Chloramphenicol was employed as selection marker for the standard system using L. lactis NZ9000, whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacF gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing L. lactis NZ3900. Comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 kU/L of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the lacLM genes and the selection marker used. The occurrence of codons less frequently used by L. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacL gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of lacLM from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.
TI  - Genetic screening of wine-related enzymes in Lactobacillus species isolated from  South African wines.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of genes coding for enzymes of oenological relevance in wine Lactobacillus strains isolated from South African grape and wine samples during the 2001 and 2002 harvest seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 120 wine lactobacilli isolates belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus paraplantarum were genetically screened for enzyme-encoding genes using PCR with primers specific for beta-glucosidase, protease, esterase, citrate lyase and phenolic acid decarboxylase. The results of PCR screening showed that the Lactobacillus strains possessed different combinations of enzymes and that some strains did not possess any of the enzymes tested. Confirmation analysis with gene sequencing also showed high similarity of genes with those available in GenBank database. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have demonstrated the existence of genes coding for wine-related enzymes in wine lactobacilli that could potentially hydrolyse wine precursors to positively influence wine aroma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: An expansion of knowledge on the genetic diversity of wine-associated lactic acid bacteria will enable the selection of novel malolactic fermentation starter cultures with desired oenological traits for the improvement of the organoleptic quality of the wine, and hence wine aroma.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria for sourdough fermentation of amaranth.
AB  - Spontaneous fermented sourdoughs prepared from five amaranth flours were investigated for the presence of lactic acid bacteria predominating the autochthonous microbiota and thus may be suitable as starter cultures. The doughs were fermented with daily back-slopping on a laboratory scale at 30 degrees C for 10 days. Each day, pH-values and total titratable acidity degrees were determined and samples were analyzed for lactic acid bacteria and yeasts by cultural methods. The identity of the strains was tracked with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR during fermentation. Taxonomic identity of the strains was revealed by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA. Sugar and organic acid profiles of fermented doughs were determined with HPLC. The strains Lactobacillus plantarum RTa12, L. sakei RTa14, and Pediococcus pentosaceus RTa11 were selected and applied as starters in laboratory scale fermentations. All strains were predominant in repeated experiments, both as single strains and in combination, regardless of the amaranth flour used. The competitiveness of the strains L. plantarum RTa12 and P. pentosaceus RTa11 was characterized in further growth experiments. Both strains facilitated fast declines of pH-values, overgrew the autochthonous microbiota, and allowed stable fermentation characteristics at different temperatures. Thus, the characterized strains may be considered as candidates for amaranth sourdough starter cultures.
TI  - Polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with Tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected from different areas of Tunisia. A polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal DNA-based techniques, was used to identify Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates. PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of 102 isolates and other reference LAB strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (M-ISR) for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and M-ISR) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and L-ISR) for Lactobacilli, and (4) three PCR amplicons (S-ISR, M-ISR, and L-ISR) obtained for Pediococcus spp. and Weissella genus. The clustering and comparison of ISR-RFLP profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference LAB strains, allowed their identification as Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Enterococcus hawaiiensis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Weissella confusa. Combined 16S-23S rDNA ISR and RFLP patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of LAB and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in French wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific PCR.
AB  - The lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the Midi-Pyrenees area (South western France) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. However, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. In the present study, a total of 290 LAB isolates were identified by PCR amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional French sourdoughs. Overall, the LAB isolates belonged to 6 genera: Lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), Pediococcus (38%, 1 species), Leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), Weissella (4%, 2 species), Lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and Enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: L. plantarum, L. curvatus, L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. sakei, L. brevis, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, W. cibaria, W. confusa, L. lactis and E. hirae. Facultative heterofermentative LAB represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. Obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (L. sanfranciscencis, L. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas Leuconostoc and Weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. Detection of some LAB species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. The number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative LAB species have been revealed. Results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of LAB cocci in the sourdough ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.
TI  - Erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant lactobacilli in Italian fermented dry sausages.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the frequency of erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant lactobacilli in Italian fermented dry sausages. METHODS AND RESULTS: We isolated lactobacilli colonies from 20 salami from the north of Italy (Piacenza province) using selective medium supplemented with erythromycin or tetracycline; we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration and searched for selected erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes. A total of 312 lactobacilli colonies were genetically ascribed to 60 different strains belonging to seven Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus plantarum were the most frequently found species. Thirty strains (50%) were phenotypically resistant to erythromycin, 45 (75%) to tetracycline and 27 (45%) were resistant to both. The most frequently detected resistance genes were tet(M) and erm(B). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the presence of tetracycline- and, to a lesser extent, erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli in fermented dry sausages produced in northern Italy. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although these antibiotic-resistant lactobacilli could serve as reservoir organisms, in our study, 16 of 20 salami could be considered safe in regard to possible antibiotic resistance gene transfer to pathogens, whereas 4 of 20 could represent a borderline situation.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "Alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in Portugal.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "Alheira", a fermented sausage produced in Portugal. LAB were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. Two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and Enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. Low numbers of Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Weissella cibaria, Weissella viridescens and Enterococcus faecium were recorded. The genetic heterogeneity of L. plantarum and E. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of DNA banding patterns obtained by RAPD-PCR. Strains of L. plantarum and E. faecalis were different from different producers. This study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "Alheira".
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by lactic acid bacteria during kimchi fermentation.
AB  - We examined the role of microorganisms in the degradation of the organophosphorus (OP) insecticide chlorpyrifos (CP) during kimchi fermentation. During the fermentation of kimchi, 30 mg L(-1) of CP was added and its stability assayed during fermentation. CP was degraded rapidly until day 3 (83.3%) and degraded completely by day 9. Four CP-degrading lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from kimchi fermentation in the presence of 200 mg L(-1) CP and were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides WCP907, Lactobacillus brevis WCP902, Lactobacillus plantarum WCP931, and Lactobacillus sakei WCP904. CP could be utilized by these four strains as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. Coumaphos (CM), diazinon (DZ), parathion (PT), and methylparathion (MPT) were also degraded by WCP907, WCP902, WCP931, and WCP904 when provided as sole sources of carbon and phosphorus.
TI  - Molecular and technological characterization of lactic acid bacteria from traditional fermented sausages of Basilicata region (Southern Italy).
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional fermented sausages of the Basilicata  region were investigated by ARDRA-PCR and RAPD-PCR for taxonomic identification at species and strain level and characterized on the basis of the growth and acidification at different temperatures, incubation times, levels of NaCl and KNO(2), hydrolysis of sarcoplasmatic and myofibrillar proteins and antimicrobial, peptide/amino acid release and nitrate reductase activities. Lactobacillus sakei was the predominant species (67%) followed by Pediococcus pentosaceus (16%), Leuconostoc carnosum (8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (4%), Lactobacillus brevis (2%) and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (2%). The technological characterization revealed that most of the isolates had good acidifying and proteolytic properties. Moreover, Lb. sakei strains showed antimicrobial ability, while Leuconostoc strains the highest reduction of nitrates. This work was a preliminary study in the formulation of autochthonous starter cultures in order to standardize the production process of sausages, to preserve their typical organoleptic and sensory characteristics and to improve the quality of final product.
TI  - Lactobacillus role during conditioning of refrigerated and vacuum-packaged Argentinean meat.
AB  - The role of Lactobacillus strains with bioprotective and technological potential  on raw beef during 15days of storage under vacuum at 7 degrees C was investigated. The assayed strains were able to grow on the meat, Lactobacillus curvatus CRL705 and Lactobacillus sakei 23K showing the highest competitiveness. A net increase of amino acids was determined in inoculated samples when compared to the control, this being maximal for Lactobacillus plantarum CRL681. Although an important endogenous activity of meat sarcoplasmic proteins was observed, the disappearance of protein bands and the generation of a new one were detected as a consequence of Lactobacillus growth. A synergistic effect of Lactobacillus in combination with the muscle proteolytic enzyme complex can be suggested. From the studied strains, the bacteriocin producer L. curvatus CRL705 may be considered as a good candidate to contribute to meat ageing by means of small peptides and free amino acids generation while improving shelf life.
TI  - Co-factor engineering in lactobacilli: effects of uncoupled ATPase activity on metabolic fluxes in Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum and L. sakei.
AB  - The hydrolytic F(1)-part of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase was over-expressed in Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum NC8 and L. sakei Lb790x during fermentation of glucose or ribose, in order to study how changes in the intracellular levels of ATP and ADP affect the metabolic fluxes. The uncoupled ATPase activity resulted in a decrease in intracellular energy level (ATP/ADP ratio), biomass yield and growth rate. Interestingly, the glycolytic and ribolytic flux increased in L. plantarum with uncoupled ATPase activity compared to the reference strain by up to 20% and 50%, respectively. The ATP demand was estimated to have approximately 80% control on both the glycolytic and ribolytic flux in L. plantarum under these conditions. In contrast, the glycolytic and ribolytic flux decreased in L. sakei with uncoupled ATPase activity.
TI  - High-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei using a Sakacin P-based expression system.
AB  - This work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri L103, Lactobacillus acidophilus R22, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, and Lactobacillus sakei Lb790. These enzymes consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kDa, which are encoded by two overlapping genes, lacL and lacM, respectively. We have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors pSIP403 and pSIP409, which are based on the sakacin P operon of L. sakei ( Sorvig et al. Microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. sakei Lb790. Results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 U/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the lacLM genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. Highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of L. plantarum WCFS1 harboring the plasmid pEH3R containing the lacLM gene from L. reuteri L103. These cultivations yielded approximately 23 000 U of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. To further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from L. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. The properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from L. reuteri L103. The presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Inactivation of food spoilage microorganisms by hydrodynamic cavitation to achieve pasteurization and sterilization of fluid foods.
AB  - Hydrodynamic cavitation is the formation of gas bubbles in a fluid due to pressure fluctuations induced by mechanical means. Various high-acid (pH < [corrected]/= 4.6) fluid foods were processed in a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor to determine if commercial sterility can be achieved at reduced processing temperatures. Sporicidal properties of the process were also tested on a low-acid (pH > [corrected] 4.6) fluid food. Fluid foods were pumped under pressure into a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor and subjected to 2 rotor speeds and flow rates to achieve 2 designated exit temperatures. Thermal inactivation kinetics were used to determine heat-induced lethality for all organisms. Calcium-fortified apple juice processed at 3000 and 3600 rpm rotor speeds on the reactor went through a transient temperature change from 20 to 65.6 or 76.7 degrees C and the total process lethality exceeded 5-log reduction of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei cells, and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells and ascospores. Tomato juice inoculated with Bacillus coagulans spores and processed at 3000 and 3600 rpm rotor speeds endured a transient temperature from 37.8 to 93.3 or 104.4 degrees C with viable CFU reductions of 0.88 and 3.10 log cycles, respectively. Skim milk inoculated with Clostridium sporogenes putrefactive anaerobe 3679 spores and processed at 3000 or 3600 rpm rotor speeds endured a transient temperature from 48.9 to 104.4 or 115.6 degrees C with CFU reductions of 0.69 and 2.84 log cycles, respectively. Utilizing hydrodynamic cavitation to obtain minimally processed pasteurized low-acid and commercially sterilized high-acid fluid foods is possible with appropriate process considerations for different products.
TI  - Factors affecting the adsorption of bacteriocins to Lactobacillus sakei and Enterococcus sp.
AB  - Bacteriocins bacJW3BZ and bacJW6BZ produced by Lactobacillus plantarum, and bacJW11BZ and bacJW15BZ produced by Lactobacillus fermentum, inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Treatment of Enterococcus sp. HKLHS and Lactobacillus sakei DSM 20017 with these bacteriocins deformed the cells and resulted in DNA and beta-galactosidase leakage. The bacteriocins adsorbed to sensitive and resistant strains. Optimal adsorption of bacJW3BZ and bacJW6BZ to Enterococcus sp. HKLHS was recorded at pH 10.0, whereas adsorption of bacJW11BZ and bacJW15BZ was favored at pH 4.0-8.0 and 2.0-4.0, respectively. Adsorption to L. sakei DSM 20017 was less influenced by pH. Incubation temperature had a major influence on the adsorption of bacJW6BZ and bacJW11BZ to sensitive cells, with better results recorded below 30 degrees C. Although variable results were recorded for bacJW3BZ and bacJW15BZ, optimal adsorption occurred between 37 and 60 degrees C. Variable levels of adsorption were recorded in the presence of inorganic salts and solvents, and this seems to be species-specific. Maximal adsorption (100%) was recorded for bacJW3BZ and bacJW15BZ to L. sakei DSM 20017 in the presence of most inorganic salts and solvents tested. Maximal adsorption of bacJW6BZ to Enterococcus sp. HKLHS (50%) was recorded in the presence of Triton X-114 and little (17%) or no adsorption in the presence of other reagents.
TI  - Application of neural networks to simulate the growth profile of lactic acid bacteria in green olive fermentation.
AB  - The growth profile of five strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287, L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, Lactobacillus paracasei ACA-DC 4037, Lactobacillus sakei LQC 1378, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides LQC 1398) was investigated in controlled fermentation of cv. Conservolea green olives with a multilayer perceptron network, a combined logistic-Fermi function, and a two-term Gompertz function. Neural network training was based on the steepest-descent gradient learning algorithm. Model performance was compared with the experimental data with five statistical indices, namely coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative percentage error (MRPE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and standard error of prediction (SEP). The experimental data set consisted of 125 counts (CFU per milliliter) of lactic acid bacteria during the green olive fermentation process for up to 38 days (5 strains x 25 sampling days). For model development, a standard methodology was followed, dividing the data set into training (120 data) and validation (25 data) subsets. Our results demonstrated that the developed network was able to model the growth and survival profile of all the strains of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation equally well with the statistical models. The performance indices for the training subset of the multilayer perceptron network were R2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.097, MRPE = 0.069, MAPE = 0.933, and SEP = 1.316. The relevant mean values for the logistic-Fermi and two-term Gompertz functions were R2 = 0.981 and 0.989, RMSE = 0.109 and 0.083, MRPE = 0.026 and 0.030, MAPE = 1.430 and 1.076, and SEP = 1.490 and 1.127, respectively. For the validation subset, the network also gave good predictions (R2 = 0.968, RMSE = 0.149, MRPE = 0.100, MAPE = 1.411, and SEP = 2.009).
TI  - Quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production is down-regulated by N-terminally truncated species of gene activators.
AB  - Down-regulation of quorum-sensing based pathways is an important but yet poorly understood process in bacterial gene regulation. In this study, we show that the gene regulator plnC not only acts as an activator gene in the quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum C11, but it also concurrently codes for truncated forms that were shown to repress bacteriocin production. By amino acid N-terminal sequencing and DNA sequence analysis, the truncated species of PlnC are believed to be translated from alternative start codons located in the so-called receiver domain of the regulator. To analyse the structure-function relationship of truncated species of PlnC, we performed a series of systematic truncation mutations: ten in the receiver domain, one in the hinge region and two in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. It was revealed that any truncation mutation containing a disrupted receiver domain together with an intact DNA-binding domain displayed a repressive effect on bacteriocin production. Such a gene repression mechanism mediated by truncated regulators was also found in two other quorum-sensing based bacteriocin systems (spp in L. sakei LTH673 and NC8-pln in L. plantarum NC8), suggesting that this mode of repression might represent a common means applied by bacteria to down-regulate certain quorum-sensing based pathways.
TI  - Characterisation of the gap operon from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - Glycolysis constitutes the primary energy-generating pathway of most species of lactic acid bacteria. The metabolism ultimately results in massive lactic acid production, which is responsible for the major preservative effect of these organisms. This study reports the identification, sequencing, and characterisation of the central glycolytic operon, the gap operon, from Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and L. sakei Lb790. The structure of the operons of the two Lactobacillus strains were similar and organised in the order cggR-gap-pgk-tpi-eno, encoding a putative central glycolytic gene regulator and the four glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, and enolase, respectively. This operon structure has not been reported in any other bacterial species so far. Transcriptional analysis revealed three major transcripts, the mono-cistronic gap and eno and the tetra-cistronic gap-pgk-tpi-eno.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rDNA-based methods.
AB  - AIM: To determine the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. In all, 387 colonies growing on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (ISR), ISR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis profiles as Lactobacillus (37%), Leuconostoc (43%), Carnobacterium (11%), Enterococcus (4%) and Lactococcus (2%). Leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. The analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in LAB populations in both products and showed that Leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results pointed to Leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of Leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by PCR).
TI  - Sequencing of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene for identification of lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the intestinal microbiota of healthy salmonids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen LAB strains were isolated from the intestinal microbiota of healthy salmonids. A approximately 500-bp region of the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and following this, a portion of the amplicon (272-bp) including the V1 and V2 variable regions was sequenced. The sequence containing both the V1 and V2 region provided strong evidence for the identification of LAB. The LAB strains were identified as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The method described was found to be a very simple, rapid, specific, and low-cost tool for the identification of unknown strains of LAB.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of arginine deiminase from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962 in Escherichia coli BL21.
AB  - The arcA gene that encodes arginine deiminase (ADI, EC 3.5.3.6)--a key enzyme of  the ADI pathway--was cloned from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962. The deduced amino acid sequence of the arcA gene showed high homology with the arcA gene from Lactobacillus plantarum (99%) and from Lactobacillus sakei (60%), respectively. The arcA gene from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 was expressed in soluble fraction of recombinant Escherichia coli BL21. ADI produced from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 (LADI) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was purified using sequential Q-Sepharose anion exchange and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column chromatography. The final yield of LADI in the purification procedure was 63.5%, and the specific activity was 140.27 U/mg. The presence of purified LADI was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and determination of the molecular mass. The LADI had a molecular mass of about 140 kDa, and comprised a homotrimer of 46 kDa in the native condition. LADI exhibited only 35% amino acid sequence homology with ADI from Mycoplasma arginini. However, LADI shared a similar three dimensional structure. The K(M) and V(max) values for arginine were 8.67+/-0.045 mM (mean+/-SD) and 344.83+/-1.79 micromol/min/mg, respectively, and the optimum temperature and pH for the production of LADI were 60 degrees C and 7.2.
TI  - Phenotypic and technological diversity of lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci  isolated from traditionally fermented sausages in southern Greece.
AB  - The physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of spontaneously fermented sausages made by two medium-sized enterprises (MSE) located in southern Greece have been studied. A total of 300 lactic acid bacteria and 300 staphylococcal strains have been isolated and identified by their physiological characteristics. Lactobacillus plantarum strains were found to dominate the lactic acid bacteria microbiota in most of the cases with L. sakei strains prevailing in some of them and L. rhamnosus strains occasionally accompanying the dominant lactic acid bacteria microbiota. On the other hand, S. saprophyticus strains were found to dominate the staphylococcal microbiota in all spontaneously fermented sausages with of S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. gallinarum and S. cohnii cohnii strains being sporadically present. Following the identification, an evaluation of their technological properties, namely proteolytic and lipolytic capacities as well as production of biogenic amines and antimicrobial compounds, took place. None of the lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci was found to possess lipolytic activity whereas a total of 6 lactic acid bacteria and 51 staphylococci strains were found to be able to hydrolyse either the sarcoplasic, myofibrillar or both protein fractions. Furthermore, only one L. sakei strain and 185 staphylococci strains were found to possess decarboxylase activity against lysine, tyrosine, ornithine or histidine. Finally none of the staphylococcal microbiota and 3 lactic acid bacteria strains were found to be able to produce antimicrobial compounds of proteinaceous nature against Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Diversity of the genus Lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. The authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of Lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of Lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii and L. sakei. This paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. Phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested that L. salivarius was closer to L. plantarum than to L. sakei, which was closest to Enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16S rRNA gene relatedness. A total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. Species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. A Lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising L. salivarius-L. plantarum; L. sakei; E. faecalis; and L. acidophilus-L. johnsonii. The extreme divergence of the Lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.
TI  - Intraspecific diversity of Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides associated with vacuum-packed meat product spoilage analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR.
AB  - The intraspecific diversity of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus plantarum was analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR with universal primers M13 and T3. The study included 100 reference strains and 210 isolates recovered from two vacuum-packed Spanish meat products, fiambre de magro adobado and morcilla, previously identified by rDNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles. The RAPD-M13 profiles identified isolates at species level in L. plantarum and L. mesenteroides, while RAPD-T3 provided profiles in L. sakei. The combination of RAPD-M13 and RAPD-T3 fingerprints revealed a total of 17 profiles in L. mesenteroides, 6 in L. sakei, 12 in L. plantarum, and 6 in L. curvatus. Of these, six profiles corresponding to L. mesenteroides and one corresponding to L. sakei were found in both products. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'), calculated according to RAPD-M13 and RAPD-T3 profiles during storage, revealed that most profiles appeared only in single samplings in both products, indicating a high strain substitution rate during chilled storage of vacuum-packed meat products. When bloating appeared, only one profile corresponding to L. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was present throughout the storage period.
TI  - Use of molecular tools to characterize Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Greek traditional fermented sausages.
AB  - In this study, our purpose was to molecular characterize Lactobacillus strains isolated from naturally fermented sausages, produced in three different processing plants in continental Greece, in order to investigate the differences of strains coming from different producing areas. Three-hundred and thirty eight strains were isolated throughout the fermentation periods on MRS. They were identified by species-specific PCR and sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene. The results obtained highlighted that the main populations involved in the fermentations studied belonged to the species Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus. However, for each of the fermentations, the percentage of isolation for the three main species was different. Molecular characterization of these strains was performed by RAPD-PCR with primer M13 and cluster analysis was applied to define relations and degrees of similarities between strains. This analysis led to the understanding that some strains were plant-specific, whereas others shared a degree of homology independently of the provenience. This evidence is highlighting the capability of the strains to adapt to specific production condition, becoming the main responsible for the transformations, thereby influencing the final characteristics of the sausages.
TI  - Factors affecting the adsorption of bacteriocins ST194BZ and ST23LD to Lactobacillus sakei and Enterococcus sp.
AB  - Bacteriocins ST194BZ and ST23LD, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum, inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Images obtained by atomic force microscopy showed clear signs of membrane damage of Lactobacillus sakei, accompanied by the leakage of DNA and beta-galactosidase. Adsorption of the bacteriocins to cells was increased when cells were treated with buffers at pH values above neutral. An increase in bacteriocin ST194BZ adsorption to cells of Enterococcus sp. and L. sakei was observed with an increase in incubation temperatures, but at different rates for the two species. Treatment of the two species with various inorganic salts and solvents gave different results regarding the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. In general, pre-treatment of the two sensitive cells with Triton X-100, Triton X-114 and chloroform increased the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. Increased adsorption of bacteriocin ST23LD to L. sakei was recorded when the cells were pre-treated with Tris and NH4-citrate. Treatment of Enterococcus sp. and L. sakei with Na-EDTA and SDS decreased the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. Variable results were recorded with inorganic salts.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a Spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  - Counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, NaCl and nitrate contents and pH and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the NW of Spain. In general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the Enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. From MRS agar, SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, VRBG agar, and KAA agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. A total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. Among the isolates from MRS agar, Lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus plantarum. Of the 200 isolates obtained from SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, only 56 strains belonged to the Staphylococcaceae or Micrococcaceae families. Among the Staphylococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by Staph. epidermidis; Staph. equorum, Staph. capitis and Staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. Among the Micrococcaceae, Micrococcus luteus predominated, followed by Micrococcus lylae, Kocuria varians and Kocuria kristinae. Of the 150 isolates obtained from VRBG agar, Hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as Salmonella. Among the 190 isolates obtained from KAA agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, one as Enterococcus faecalis and 101 as Enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.
TI  - Parameters affecting the adsorption of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum 423 isolated from sorghum beer.
AB  - Plantaricin 423 is bactericidal to logarithmic and stationary-phase cells of Enterococcus sp. HKLHS and L. sakei DSM 20017. Detection of extracellular DNA and beta-galactosidase suggests that the mode of action is most probably by destabilizing of the cell membrane. Adsorption of plantaricin 423 to target cells ranged from 17% for Streptococcus caprinus ATCC 700066 to 67% for Lactobacillus plantarum LMG 13556, Lactobacillus curvatus DF38, Listeria innocua LMG 13568 and Lactobacillus sakei DSM 20017. Treatment of Enterococcus sp. HKLHS and L. sakei DSM 20017 with Triton X-100, Triton X-114 and chloroform increased the adsorption of plantaricin.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Improved expression and purification of the correctly folded response regulator PlnC from lactobacilli.
AB  - The response regulator PlnC is part of the signal transduction system that plays  a key role in the regulation of bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum C11. In this study, we wanted to express high levels of the response regulator PlnC in a soluble and native form for purification and further studies. The protein was expressed as a fusion protein (fPlnC) containing an N-terminal Flag-tag to facilitate detection and purification. When the fusion gene, fplnC, was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, nearly all (99%) of the recombinant protein ended up inside inclusion bodies as an incorrectly folded protein. By utilizing two different Gram-positive expression systems (SIP and NICE) in L. plantarum NC8 and Lactobacillus sakei Lb790, the expression of the soluble fPlnC was significantly increased, being 20-40 times more than that in E. coli BL21. Using the N-terminal tag, the expressed protein was purified by immunoprecipitation. By DNA-binding study (EMSA), we demonstrated that the fusion protein purified from the soluble pool was correctly folded as judged by its ability to bind specifically on regulated promoters. Using our approach, we estimate that about 1 mg of fPlnC can be purified from 11 of the bacterial culture.
TI  - A synthetic promoter library for constitutive gene expression in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - A synthetic promoter library (SPL) for Lactobacillus plantarum has been developed, which generalizes the approach for obtaining synthetic promoters. The consensus sequence, derived from rRNA promoters extracted from the L. plantarum WCFS1 genome, was kept constant, and the non-consensus sequences were randomized. Construction of the SPL was performed in a vector (pSIP409) previously developed for high-level, inducible gene expression in L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei. A wide range of promoter strengths was obtained with the approach, covering 3-4 logs of expression levels in small increments of activity. The SPL was evaluated for the ability to drive beta-glucuronidase (GusA) and aminopeptidase N (PepN) expression. Protein production from the synthetic promoters was constitutive, and the most potent promoters gave high protein production with levels comparable to those of native rRNA promoters, and production of PepN protein corresponding to approximately 10-15 % of the total cellular protein. High correlation was obtained between the activities of promoters when tested in L. sakei and L. plantarum, which indicates the potential of the SPL for other Lactobacillus species. The SPL enables fine-tuning of stable gene expression for various applications in L. plantarum.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Characterization of ISLpl4, a functional insertion sequence in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - A Lactobacillus plantarum strain, CECT 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. The prototype copy (Lp1) of this insertion sequence (named ISLpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with IS982 family transposases. Perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. Upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. The ISLpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the CECT 4645 strain. This finding strongly supports our hypothesis that ISLpl4 is a functional element in L. plantarum. Some of these elements may be cryptic, since point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. ISLpl4 copies have been detected in Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Oenococcus oeni, and Lactobacillus sakei. An ISLpl4 copy of O. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. Although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among IS.
TI  - Monitoring the bacterial population dynamics during fermentation of artisanal Argentinean sausages.
AB  - The dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the artisanal fermentation of dry sausage produced in Argentina was investigated by using classical and molecular approaches. The combined use of RAPD analysis with primers M13, XD9, RAPD1 and RAPD2 and 16S rDNA sequencing were applied to the identification and intraspecific differentiation of 100 strains of lactobacilli and Micrococcaceae. DGGE analysis was used to monitor the dynamic changes in population after total microbial DNA was directly extracted from sausages and subjected to PCR using V3f (GC), Bact-0124f-GC and Univ-0515r primers. The sequence analysis of 16S rDNA of the dominant species was also carried out. Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum were the dominant lactic acid organisms during the fermentation while Staphylococcus saprophyticus represented the dominant species of Micrococcaceae. It was demonstrated that the ripening process of Argentinean artisanal fermented sausage is driven by a limited number of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus strains selected from environmental microbiota by the ability to best compete under the prevailing conditions of the ecological niche. The identification of dominant communities present in this artisanal fermented sausage can help in the selection of starter cultures consisting in well adapted strains to the particular production technology.
TI  - Identification of potential probiotic starter cultures for Scandinavian-type fermented sausages.
AB  - Potential probiotic cultures suitable as starter cultures for the Scandinavian-type fermented sausages were identified among strains well-adapted to fermented meats as well as strains originating from a culture collection. From 15 different fermented meat products, 22 strains were isolated as dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB). The isolates were identified by RAPD, API and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and showed to be five strains of Lactobacillus sakei, five strains of Lactobacillus farciminis, five strains belonging to the group of Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, four strains of Lactobacillus alimentarius, two strains of Lactobacillus brevis and one strain of Lactobacillus versmoldensis. Heterofermentative strains as well as strains not growing at 37 degrees C and not lowering pH below 5.1 in a meat model were excluded leaving 9 strains for further studies. These strains together with 19 strains from a culture collection were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to pH 2.5 or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. Strains that fulfilled all the probiotic criteria and showed to be fast acid producers in a meat model included three strains belonging to the group of Lb. plantarum/pentosus (MF1291, MF1298, MF1300) which originated from the dominant NSLAB of fermented meat products. MF1291 and MF 1298 were further identified as Lb. plantarum and MF1300 as Lb. pentosus. The three strains were all successfully applied as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausage. The viable count at the end of the processing period reached high cell numbers (4.7x10(7)-2.9x10(8) cfu/g) and pH of the sausages decreased to pH 4.8-4.9 without any flavour deviation compared to sausage fermented by a commercial meat starter culture.
TI  - High-level, inducible gene expression in Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum using versatile expression vectors.
AB  - Vectors have been developed for inducible gene expression in Lactobacillus sakei  and Lactobacillus plantarum in which expression of the gene of interest is driven by strong, regulated promoters from bacteriocin operons found in L. sakei strains. The activity of these promoters is controlled via a two-component signal transduction system, which responds to an externally added peptide pheromone. The vectors have a modular design, permitting easy exchange of all essential elements: the inducible promoter, the cognate regulatory system, the gene of interest, the antibiotic resistance marker and the replicon. Various variants of these so-called 'pSIP' vectors were constructed and tested, differing in terms of the bacteriocin regulon from which the regulatory elements were derived (sakacin A or sakacin P), the regulated promoter selected from these regulons, and the replicon (derived from p256 or pSH71). Using beta-glucuronidase (GusA) and aminopeptidase N (PepN) as reporters, it was shown that the best vectors permitted inducible, pheromone-dose-dependent gene expression at very high levels, while displaying moderate basal activities when not induced. The most effective set-up was obtained using a vector containing the pSH71 replicon, the orfX promoter from the sakacin P regulon, and the cognate regulatory genes, in a L. sakei host. GusA levels obtained with this set-up were approximately ten times higher than the levels obtained with prototype pSIP versions, whereas PepN levels amounted to almost 50% of total cellular protein.
TI  - Characterisation of lab in typical Salento Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria isolated from the typical Pecorino cheese of the Salento area of Italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. A preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. For the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene was employed In addition, restriction analysis of amplified rDNA (ARDRA) and PCR and AFLP fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated UPGMA cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of Pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. The main identified strains were Lactobacillus brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. sakei, L. pentosus, L. farciminis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
TI  - Evolution and identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated during the ripening of Sardinian sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during the production and the ripening of Sardinian sausage, a typical Italian dry fermented sausage. Samples were taken at different stages, and 112 strains were isolated. The isolates were characterized using the micromethod proposed by Font de Valdez et al. [Font de Valdez, G., Savoy de Giori, G., Oliver, G., & De Ruiz Holgado, A. P. (1993). Development and optimization of an expensive microsystem for the biochemical characterization of lactobacilli. Microbiologie Aliments Nutrition, 11, 215-219]. Schillinger and Lucke's [Schillinger, U., & Lucke, F. K. (1987). Identification of lactobacilli from meat and meat products. Food Microbiology. (4), 199-208] scheme and the biochemical patterns given by Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (1986). Baltimore: William and Wilkins] were used for preliminary identification. A PCR-based method was then used to confirm the results. LAB were the dominant flora during ripening. They consisted mainly of homofermentative mesophilic rods. Lactobacillus sakei (43,3%), Lactobacillus plantarum (16,6%) and Lactobacillus curvatus (13,3%) were the main isolates. The results of the biochemical identification methods agreed well with those of PCR-based identification (91% agreement).
TI  - Lactobacillus hammesii sp. nov., isolated from French sourdough.
AB  - Twenty morphologically different strains were chosen from French wheat sourdough  isolates. Cells were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods. The isolates were identified using amplified-fragment length polymorphism, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. All isolates were members of the genus Lactobacillus. They were identified as representing Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus spicheri and Lactobacillus sakei. However, two isolates (LP38(T) and LP39) could be clearly discriminated from recognized Lactobacillus species on the basis of genotyping methods. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and DNA-DNA relatedness data indicate that the two strains belong to a novel Lactobacillus species, for which the name Lactobacillus hammesii is proposed. The type strain is LP38(T) (=DSM 16381(T)=CIP 108387(T)=TMW 1.1236(T)).
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - FT-IR spectroscopy for identification of closely related lactobacilli.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to analyse 56 strains from four closely related species of Lactobacillus, L. sakei, L. plantarum, L. curvatus and L. paracasei. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) was used to study the clusters in the data, but in the dendrogram, the spectra were not differentiated into four separate clusters corresponding to species. When the data were analysed with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), the strains were differentiated into four clusters according to species. It was also possible to recognise strains that were incorrectly identified by conventional methods prior to the FT-IR analysis. PLSR was used to identify strains from three of the species, and the results were compared to two other multivariate methods, Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). The three methods gave equally good identification results. The results show that FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with PLSR, or other multivariate methods, is well suited for identification of Lactobacillus at the species level, even in quite large data sets.
TI  - Evaluation of meat born lactic acid bacteria as protective cultures for the biopreservation of cooked meat products.
AB  - In this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. Strains were first tested on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. Secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards Listeria monocytogenes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc carnosum and Brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. In total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. However, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, L. monocytogenes, B. thermosphacta and Leuc. mesenteroides. Finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees C under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. All 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin S producing Lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. The 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. All strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees C from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing L. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. As the glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying pH decrease. Cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13E, 10A, 14A (all three identified as L. sakei subsp. carnosus by SDS-PAGE) and with strains L. sakei 148 (LS5) and L. sakei subsp. carnosus SAGA 777 (LS8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees C. Therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.
TI  - Expression of the catalase gene katA in starter culture Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR850 tolerates oxidative stress and reduces lipid oxidation in fermented meat product.
AB  - The catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei SR911 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli UM2 and Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR850 under strong lactococcal promoter P59 in E. coli-lactococcus expression vector pIL1020. The L. plantarum TISTR850 is a catalase-deficient strain isolated from local fermented meat product. The recombinant L. plantarum TISTR850 was shown to decompose hydrogen peroxide, and catalase activity approximately three times higher that of natural catalase-producing strain L. sakei SR911. The recombinant protein was also detected by in situ activity staining of the catalase enzyme. The recombinant L. plantarum TISTR850 did not accumulate hydrogen peroxide under glucose-limited aerobic conditions and remained viable after 60 h of incubation. The recombinant and host strain L. plantarum TISTR850 were used as starter cultures in the fermented meat product, and lipid oxidation was monitored over a 7-day storage at 20 degrees C determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) value. The lipid oxidation level in the fermented meat product seeded with the catalase genetically modified starter culture L. plantarum TISTR850 was significantly lower than that of the natural catalase-deficient strain.
TI  - Use of bacteriocin promoters for gene expression in Lactobacillus plantarum C11.
AB  - AIMS: To exploit promoters involved in production of the bacteriocin sakacin P for regulated overexpression of genes in Lactobacillus plantarum C11. METHODS AND RESULTS: Production of sakacin P by Lact. sakei LTH673 is controlled by a peptide-based quorum sensing system that drives strong, regulated promoters. One of these promoters (PorfX) was used to establish regulated overexpression of genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from Bacillus pumilus, aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis or chitinase B from Serratia marcescens in Lact. plantarum C11, a strain that naturally possesses the regulatory machinery that is necessary for promoter activation. The expression levels obtained were highly dependent on which gene was used and on how the promoter was coupled to this gene. The highest expression levels (14% of total cellular protein) were obtained with the aminopeptidase N gene translationally fused to the regulated promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Sakacin promoters permit regulated expression of a variety of genes in Lact. plantarum C11. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows the usefulness of regulated bacteriocin promoters for developing new gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactobacilli.
TI  - Construction of vectors for inducible gene expression in Lactobacillus sakei and  L plantarum.
AB  - We have constructed vectors for inducible expression of genes in Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus plantarum. The key elements of these vectors are a regulatable promoter involved in the production of the bacteriocins sakacin A and sakacin P and the genes encoding the cognate histidine protein kinase and response regulator that are necessary to activate this promoter upon induction by a peptide pheromone. The vectors are built up of cassettes that permit easy exchange of all parts through restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Using beta-glucuronidase as a reporter enzyme, variants of these vectors were compared with each other, and with a corresponding system based on genes involved in the production of nisin. Several of the new vectors permitted tightly controlled and efficient expression of beta-glucuronidase in both L. sakei and L. plantarum.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus farciminis with 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region polymorphism and PCR amplification using species-specific oligonucleotide.
AB  - AIMS: The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to differentiate Lactobacillus species having closely related identities in the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR). Species-specific primers for Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were designed and allowed rapid identification of these species. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 16S-23S rDNA spacer region was amplified by primers tAla and 23S/p10, then digested by HinfI and TaqI enzymes and analysed by electrophoresis. Digestion by HinfI was not sufficient to differentiate Lact. sakei, Lact. curvatus, Lact. farciminis, Lact. alimentarius, Lact. plantarum and Lact. paraplantarum. In contrast, digestion carried out by TaqI revealed five different patterns allowing these species to be distinguished, except for Lact. plantarum from Lact. paraplantarum. The 16S-23S rDNA spacer region of Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were amplified and then cloned into vector pCR(R)2.1 and sequenced. The DNA sequences obtained were analysed and species-specific primers were designed from these sequences. The specificity of these primers was positively demonstrated as no response was obtained for 14 other species tested. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The species-specific primers for Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were shown to be useful for identifying these species among other lactobacilli. The RFLP profile obtained upon digestion with HinfI and TaqI enzymes can be used to discriminate Lact. farciminis, Lact. alimentarius, Lact. sakei, Lact. curvatus and Lact. plantarum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this paper, we have established the first species-specific primer for PCR identification of Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius. Both species-specific primer and RFLP, could be used as tools for rapid identification of lactobacilli up to species level.
TI  - Structural analysis of the peptide pheromone receptor PlnB, a histidine protein kinase from Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Intercellular communication plays a key role in the regulation of several physiological processes in gram-positive bacteria. Cell-cell communication is often mediated by secreted inducer peptide pheromones (IPs), which upon reaching a threshold concentration in the environment specifically activate a cognate membrane-localized histidine protein kinase (HPK). Interestingly, the majority of IP-activated HPKs fall into one distinct subfamily (HPK(10)). As part of an effort to study the mechanism underlying pheromone-mediated activation of the HPK(10) subfamily, the present work investigated the membrane topology of PlnB from Lactobacillus plantarum. Gene fusion experiments with Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus sakei, using alkaline phosphatase, beta-lactamase, and beta-galactosidase reporter fusions, suggested that PlnB is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via seven transmembrane segments. By domain switching between HPK(10) members, it was demonstrated that the determinants for pheromone binding and specificity are contained within the transmembrane domain. The results also indicate that the mechanism of signal transduction, in which the final transmembrane segment apparently plays a key role, is conserved between members of the HPK(10) subfamily.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a Greek dry-fermented sausage in respect of their technological and probiotic properties.
AB  - A total of 147 lactic acid bacteria was isolated from two types of naturally fermented dry sausages at four different stages of the ripening process studied in order to select the most suitable strains according to their technological characteristics including probiotic properties and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. Identification of the isolates revealed that 90% were lactobacilli, 4% enterococci, 3% Pediococcus sp. and sporadic isolates of Weissella viridescens, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and Leuconostoc sp. The isolated strains of Lactobacillus sakei (49 isolates), Lactobacillus curvatus (24 isolates) and Lactobacillus plantarum (7 isolates) were further characterized. All strains could grow at 15 degrees C, whereas the majority of the strains was able to grow in the presence of 6.5% NaCl and on acetate agar. The enzymatic potential of the strains was evaluated using the API ZYM system. During in vitro investigations all strains exhibited high leucine and valine aminopeptidase activities and moderate acid phosphatase and phosphohydrolase activities. Some strains showed very weak lipolytic activity. The enzyme profiling is an important factor for selection of strains as starter cultures. A large majority of the strains tolerated 0.1% bile salts whereas 58% of Lactobacillus curvatus strains and all Lactobacillus plantarum strains were resistant to 0.3% bile salts. All Lactobacillus sakei strains and the majority of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus plantarum strains exhibited an anti-listerial activity against three Listeria monocytogenes strains. A percentage of 75, 50 and 29% of Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus and L. plantarum strains, respectively, could inhibit two Staphylococcus aureus strains. The contribution of the selected strains to a possible inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus in situ on fermented meats would be of considerable interest to enhance the hygienic quality of these products.
TI  - Characterization of a theta-type plasmid from Lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid pRV500, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei RV332, was determined. Sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type I restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. The structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repA gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that pRV500 belongs to the pUCL287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. A 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an Escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector pRV566 and was observed to be functional in L. sakei for plasmid replication. The L. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in E. coli. Plasmid pRV500 and its derivative pRV566 were determined to be at very low copy numbers in L. sakei. pRV566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to L. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. Sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - Development of an inducible gene expression system for Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - AIM: To develop an inducible gene expression system for Lactobacillus sakei, based on the regulatory system of sakacin A production. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Lactobacillus/Escherichia coli shuttle vector; pKRV3, was constructed including the signal transducing system genes of the bacteriocin sakacin A. The gusA gene fused to PsapA promoter, cloned in this vector allowed for inducible beta-glucuronidase expression in L. sakei and L. plantarum following the addition of the sakacin A inducing peptide. PsapA appeared to be a strong and tightly controlled promoter when compared with known promoters. CONCLUSION: The pKRV3 system can be used as an inducible gene expression system in lactobacilli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A novel, inducible gene expression system has been developed for lactic acid bacteria relevant in food fermentations.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus sakei by the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid produced.
AB  - Lactobacillus sakei strains were characterized by the shift of the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid produced in the presence of 50 mM sodium acetate in a medium. Of 27 Lactobacillus sakei strains studied, 20 strains showed high levels of DNA-DNA similarity with L. sakei NRIC 1071(T), and were confirmed as L. sakei. The three remaining strains were identified as Lactobacillus curvatus by DNA-DNA similarity, and three other strains were included in the cluster of Lactobacillus plantarum/Lactobacillus pentosus/Lactobacillus paraplantarum and one strain in the cluster of Lactobacillus paracasei on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Of the 20 L. sakei strains, 19 strains shifted the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid produced from the DL-type to the L-type in the presence of 50 mM sodium acetate. L. curvatus strains and strains included in the cluster of L. plantarum/L. pentosus/L. paraplantarum and in the cluster of L. paracasei did not shift the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid produced. The change of the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid from the DL-type to the L-type in the presence of sodium acetate was concluded to be species-specific for L. sakei and useful for identification of strains in this species.
TI  - Molecular characterization of tet(M) genes in Lactobacillus isolates from different types of fermented dry sausage.
AB  - The likelihood that products prepared from raw meat and milk may act as vehicles  for antibiotic-resistant bacteria is currently of great concern in food safety issues. In this study, a collection of 94 tetracycline-resistant (Tc(r)) lactic acid bacteria recovered from nine different fermented dry sausage types were subjected to a polyphasic molecular study with the aim of characterizing the host organisms and the tet genes, conferring tetracycline resistance, that they carry. With the (GTG)(5)-PCR DNA fingerprinting technique, the Tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. sakei subsp. sakei, L. curvatus, and L. alimentarius and typed to the intraspecies level. For a selection of 24 Tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates displaying unique (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprints, tet genes were determined by means of PCR, and only tet(M) was detected. Restriction enzyme analysis with AccI and ScaI revealed two different tet(M) allele types. This grouping was confirmed by partial sequencing of the tet(M) open reading frame, which indicated that the two allele types displayed high sequence similarities (>99.6%) with tet(M) genes previously reported in Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 101 and in Neisseria meningitidis, respectively. Southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed that the isolates contained tet(M)-carrying plasmids. In addition to the tet(M) gene, one isolate also contained an erm(B) gene on a different plasmid from the one encoding the tetracycline resistance. Furthermore, it was also shown by PCR that the tet(M) genes were not located on transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed molecular study demonstrating that taxonomically and genotypically diverse Lactobacillus strains from different types of fermented meat products can be a host for plasmid-borne tet genes.
TI  - Susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. A study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. This is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. A selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the Etest (ABBiodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. The strains belonged to the following species: Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. sakei, L. curvatus and species of the L. acidophilus group: L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. acidophilus. The results from the Etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. For the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. The differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. On the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) for the individual Lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.
TI  - The effect of sodium acetate on the growth yield, the production of L- and D-lactic acid, and the activity of some enzymes of the glycolytic pathway of Lactobacillus sakei NRIC 1071(T) and Lactobacillus plantarum NRIC 1067(T).
AB  - The effect of sodium acetate was studied on the change of the growth yield, the production of L- and D-lactic acid, and the activity of lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs; L-lactate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.27, L-LDH] plus D-lactate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.28, D-LDH]), fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase [EC 4.1.2.13, FBP-aldolase], and phosphofructokinase [EC 2.7.1.11, PFK] of Lactobacillus sakei NRIC 1071(T) and Lactobacillus plantarum NRIC 1067(T). The growth yield of L. sakei NRIC 1071(T) was increased 1.6 times in the presence of sodium acetate compared with its absence. The activity of LDHs in L. sakei NRIC 1071(T) and L. plantarum NRIC 1067(T) was retained longer under the addition of sodium acetate in the reaction mixture. As a result, these strains produced much more lactic acid in the presence of sodium acetate compared with its absence. Furthermore, the activity of L-LDH in L. sakei NRIC 1071(T) cultivated in the presence of sodium acetate increased three times or more compared with the activity of the cells cultivated in its absence. Consequently, the type of stereoisomers of lactic acid produced by L. sakei shifted from the DL-type to the L-type because the ratio of L-lactic acid to D-lactic acid produced became larger with the addition of sodium acetate to culture media. This phenomenon was not observed in L. plantarum NRIC 1067(T). Further, the participation of lactate racemase is discussed from the viewpoint of the production of D-lactic acid by L. sakei.
TI  - Arginine catabolism by sourdough lactic acid bacteria: purification and characterization of the arginine deiminase pathway enzymes from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1.
AB  - The cytoplasmic extracts of 70 strains of the most frequently isolated sourdough  lactic acid bacteria were screened initially for arginine deiminase (ADI), ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), and carbamate kinase (CK) activities, which comprise the ADI (or arginine dihydrolase) pathway. Only obligately heterofermentative strains such as Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1; Lactobacillus brevis AM1, AM8, and 10A; Lactobacillus hilgardii 51B; and Lactobacillus fructivorans DD3 and DA106 showed all three enzyme activities. Lactobacillus plantarum B14 did not show CK activity. L. sanfranciscensis CB1 showed the highest activities, and the three enzymes were purified from this microorganism to homogeneity by several chromatographic steps. ADI, OTC, and CK had apparent molecular masses of ca. 46, 39, and 37 kDa, respectively, and the pIs were in the range of 5.07 to 5.2. The OTCs, CKs, and especially ADIs were well adapted to pH (acidic, pH 3.5 to 4.5) and temperature (30 to 37 degrees C) conditions which are usually found during sourdough fermentation. Internal peptide sequences of the three enzymes had the highest level of homology with ADI, OTC, and CK of Lactobacillus sakei. L. sanfranciscensis CB1 expressed the ADI pathway either on MAM broth containing 17 mM arginine or during sourdough fermentation with 1 to 43 mM added arginine. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that ADI, OTC, and CK were induced by factors of ca. 10, 4, and 2 in the whole-cell extract of cells grown in MAM broth containing 17 mM arginine compared to cells cultivated without arginine. Arginine catabolism in L. sanfranciscensis CB1 depended on the presence of a carbon source and arginine; glucose at up to ca. 54 mM did not exert an inhibitory effect, and the pH was not relevant for induction. The pH of sourdoughs fermented by L. sanfranciscensis CB1 was dependent on the amount of arginine added to the dough. A low supply of arginine (6 mM) during sourdough fermentation by L. sanfranciscensis CB1 enhanced cell growth, cell survival during storage at 7 degrees C, and tolerance to acid environmental stress and favored the production of ornithine, which is an important precursor of crust aroma compounds.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Metabolic and functional properties of lactic acid bacteria in the gastro-intestinal ecosystem: a comparative in vitro study between bacteria of intestinal and fermented food origin.
AB  - Metabolic and functional properties of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the human gastro-intestinal ecosystem may be related to certain beneficial health effects. In this study, lactobacilli of either intestinal or fermented food origin were compared in their capability to survive low pH and bile, in their metabolic activity in the presence of bile salts and mucins, as well as in their potential to attach to enterocyte-like CaCO-2 cells. Food fermenting bacteria especially strains of the species Lactobacillus plantarum showed high tolerance to the consecutive exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 1.5-2.5) and cholic acid (10 mM). Growth in and deconjugation of glycocholic (5 mM) and taurocholic acids (5 mM), as demonstrated for all lactobacilli of intestinal origin, was detected for food fermenting strains of the species L. plantarum, but not L. paracasei and L. sakei. Degradation of mucins was not observed for lactobacilli. Adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cell line CaCO-2 was demonstrated for several food fermenting bacterial strains in vitro. Soluble factors in the spent culture supernatants from intestinal and fermented food lactobacilli but not staphylococci cross reacted and synergized with cell wall components to promote adhesion to CaCO-2 cells. A competitive role of fecal bacteria on the adhesion of lactobacilli to CaCO-2 cells was demonstrated. In conclusion we have shown that metabolic and functional properties of intestinal lactobacilli are also found in certain bacteria of fermented food origin.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented sausages produced in Basilicata (Southern Italy).
AB  - AIMS: to evaluate the evolution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations in traditional fermented sausages (salsiccia and soppressata) produced in artisanal and industrial plants in Basilicata (Southern Italy). METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and fourteen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures were isolated from samples of sausages at different stages of ripening. A phenotypic characterization of the isolates was carried out using a set of 28 tests, and 34 clusters were identified at the 80% similarity level using hierarchical cluster analysis. Of the isolates 50% were identified as Lactobacillus sakei (with several biotypes), 22% as Pediococcus spp. (mainly Ped. pentosaceus), 7% as Leuconostoc (Leuc. carnosum, Leuc. gelidum, Leuc. pseudomesenteroides), 6% as Lact. plantarum, 1% as Lact. curvatus. Other lactobacilli, including unidentified species, were present in lower numbers. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic diversity and composition of the LAB flora varied as a function of the production plant, product type and ripening time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OT THE STUDY: A new procedure based on bootstrapping and Multidimensional Scaling was successfully used to obtain a graphical representation of the evolution of the LAB populations.
TI  - Isolation and identification of tetracycline resistant lactic acid bacteria from  pre-packed sliced meat products.
AB  - In recent years, the food chain has been recognised as one of the main routes for transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria between the animal and human population. In this regard, the current study aimed to investigate if tetracycline resistant (tetR) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are present in ready-to-eat modified atmosphere packed (MAP) sliced meat products including fermented dry sausage, cooked chicken breast meat and cooked ham. From population graphs based on doubling tetracycline concentrations between 0 and 256 microg ml(-1), only fermented dry sausage was shown to contain a high-level retR LAB population (5.10(1) - 2,23.10(4) CFU/g), and this in four out of ten examined sausages. From these four positive sausages, a total of 100 strains were isolated on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe-sorbic acid (MRS-S) agar without tetracycline (n = 45) and on MRS-S agar supplemented with a tetracycline breakpoint concentration of 64 microg ml(-1) (n = 55). Using resistance histograms derived from the disc diffusion method, all these strains were grouped as sensitive to rifampicin, erythromycin and ampicillin. All strains from the tetracycline-containing MRS-S plates were resistant to tetracycline. Identification with whole-cell protein profiling revealed that the total strain set represented four different species: Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus and Lactobacillus curvatus. All species are commonly associated with fermented dry sausage, either as starter culture or as natural contaminants. The latter three species were found to comprise all tetracycline resistant strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence for the presence of tetR LAB in final ready-to-eat pre-packed fermented dry sausages.
TI  - Development of a rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages using a polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented Italian sausages was developed. It is based on the amplification of a small fragment from the 16S rRNA gene followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus, L. alimentarius, L. casei, L. plantarum and L. brevis, obtained from International Collections, were used to optimize the method. Thiry-nine strains of Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from naturally fermented sausages and, after traditional identification, were tested by the PCR-TGGE protocol developed. No differences were observed comparing the results obtained, apart from five strains identified as L. curvatus that showed a PCR-TGGE profile identical to L. sakei.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from spoiled, vacuum-packaged, cold-smoked rainbow trout using ribotyping.
AB  - A total of 405 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from spoiled, vacuum-packaged, salted, sodium nitrite- or potassium nitrate-treated, cold-smoked rainbow trout stored at 4 degrees C or 8 degrees C were characterised and identified using a molecular method. The isolates were initially classified according to their restriction endonuclease profiles using HindIII and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and further characterised by rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotypes). Numerical analysis of these ribopatterns was performed together with 19 reference LAB strain patterns in order to identify the isolates to species level. The strains were divided with HindIII and EcoRI ribopatterns into ten and nine clusters at the similarity level of 65% and 50%, respectively. The Leuconostoc-clusters and the Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus-clusters formed the two main groups. Only one isolate was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum and no Carnobacterium strains were discovered. For both enzymes, the 35 isolates possessing six individual ribotypes and forming five clusters could not be identified further with the reference strains used. The relative proportion of Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was higher in all samples stored at 4 degrees C. Most of the Leuconostoc citreum were found in the samples stored at 8 degrees C, and particularly in the nitrite-treated samples.
