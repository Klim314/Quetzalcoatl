the maintenance of b-cell and t-cell function in frozen and stored human lymphocytes.
the objective of this study was to identify and test a convenient means for long-term storage of lymphocytes taken from clinically characterized patients without losing b- or t-cell function.
accordingly, peripheral blood lymphocytes were frozen and stored, and portions of each sample were subsequently assayed for t-cell blastogenic response and b-cell jerne plaquing at various time intervals after freezing.
a comparison of the cell counts of fresh and frozen cultures indicated that cell were recovered after freezing.
furthermore, these cells showed no significant differences in (i) cell viability; (ii) blastogenic response to antigens of actinomyces maeslandii, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tetanus toxoid; (iii) blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen; and (iv) polyclonal b-cell response to pokeweed mitogen as measured by the direct jerne plaque assay.
the retained blastogenic and plaquing responses seen in frozen cultures indicated the maintenance of both t-cell and b-cell function, respectively.
this is the first reported demonstration of jerne plaquing of normal human lymphocytes after freezing.
it appears that freezing techniques provide a means for repeating and extending both t- and b-cell assays using frozen stored portions of the same cell samples.
