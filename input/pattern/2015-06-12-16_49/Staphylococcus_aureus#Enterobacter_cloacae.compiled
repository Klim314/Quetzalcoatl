TI  - Enterobacter cloacae infection after anterior cervical decompression and fusion:  case study and literature review.
AB  - Wound infection after anterior cervical decompression and fusion can lead to disastrous consequences despite a low incidence rate. Although Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogenic bacteria, some rare bacteria such as conditional pathogenic bacteria may also result in such a condition. To the best of our knowledge, E. cloacae-caused acute infection after anterior cervical decompression and fusion has not been reported. Here, we report an E. cloacae-caused acute infection after anterior vertical decompression and fusion. This infection was eventually controlled by virtue of an early diagnosis and the correspondingly-adopted anti-infection, internal fixation removal, and drainage treatments. Exploring the reasons underlying acute infection after anterior cervical decompression and fusion caused by rare bacteria, particularly E. cloacae, by analyzing this case was the basic therapeutic principle in this study. We believe that the therapeutic principle for E. cloacae-caused wound infection after anterior cervical internal fixation is basically consistent with that for other bacterium-caused wound infections after spinal internal fixation. Sufficient drainage, the adoption of sensitive antibacterials, and internal fixation removal as early as possible when necessary are the essential measures in infection control.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Influence of 4'-O-Glycoside Constitution and Configuration on Ribosomal Selectivity of Paromomycin.
AB  - A series of 20 4'-O-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. Target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. In particular, 4'-O-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the A1555G mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. Compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of MRSA that are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-O-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant E. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Discrepancy in MALDI-TOF MS identification of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. The objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with CF. METHODS: A total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with CF representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using MALDI-TOF MS in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. Discrepancies were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing in five Gram-negative isolates. RESULTS: The MALDI-TOF MS managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as Chryseobacterium gleum and Enterobacter cloacae. The 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all Gram-negative bacteria. The isolation of E. cloacae and Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with CF. CONCLUSION: Although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with CF, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria may exist.
TI  - Environmental monitoring of bacterial contamination and antibiotic resistance patterns of the fecal coliforms isolated from Cauvery River, a major drinking water source in Karnataka, India.
AB  - The present study focuses prudent elucidation of microbial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of the fecal coliforms isolated from River Cauvery, a major drinking water source in Karnataka, India. Water samples were collected from ten hotspots during the year 2011-2012. The physiochemical characteristics and microbial count of water samples collected from most of the hotspots exhibited greater biological oxygen demand and bacterial count especially coliforms in comparison with control samples (p </= 0.01). The antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using 48 antibiotics against the bacterial isolates by disk-diffusion assay. The current study showed that out of 848 bacterial isolates, 93.51% (n = 793) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to most of the current generation antibiotics. Among the major isolates, 96.46% (n = 273) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to 30 antibiotics and they were identified to be Escherichia coli by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Similarly, 93.85% (n = 107), 94.49% (n = 103), and 90.22% (n = 157) of the isolates exhibited multiple drug resistance to 32, 40, and 37 antibiotics, and they were identified to be Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas trivialis, and Shigella sonnei, respectively. The molecular studies suggested the prevalence of bla TEM genes in all the four isolates and dhfr gene in Escherichia coli and Sh. sonnei. Analogously, most of the other Gram-negative bacteria were found to be multidrug-resistant and the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus spp. isolated from the water samples were found to be methicillin and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is probably the first study elucidating the bacterial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of fecal coliforms isolated from River Cauvery, Karnataka, India.
TI  - Conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. Our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. RESULTS: Samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. All samples showed bacterial growth. Thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. Detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. Most frequently isolated bacterial species were Bacillus spp. (13 isolates), Staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), Staphylococcus sciuri and Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), Ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). Only one isolate of Kocuria varians/rosea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. The presence in 8 animals of Mycoplasma spp. and in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of Chlamydia spp. was detected by PCR. Candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: A clear predominance of Gram positive isolates in tortoises and Gram negative isolates in turtles was found. However, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. Almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. That chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard to Salmonella spp. Therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. Worthy of note is the finding of Chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.
TI  - [The biological characteristics of dominated agents of acute enteric infections].
AB  - In 2003-2012 the rate of increase of morbidity of acute enteric infections caused by opportunistic microorganisms came to 3.6%. In the etiologic structure prevailed Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae. Their percentage varied from 70.5% to 81.6%. The opportunistic microorganisms isolated from feces of patients with acute enteric infections and individuals from control group characterized by presence of pathogenic factors of broad spectrum. The adhesive characteristics were manifested by 50.8+/-4.4% of analyzed cultures isolated from patients with symptoms of diarrhea infection and by 19.5+/-3.5% in control group. The anti-lysozyme activity was manifested correspondingly in 86.2+/-3.0% and 61.7+/-4.3% of strains. The anti-complement activity was manifested in 70.8+/-3.9% and 61.7+/-4.3% of strains. The anti-interferon activity was manifested in 100% and 95.3+/-1.9% of strains correspondingly. The level of adhesive activity in E. cloacae (35.0+/-7.5%) and anti-complement and adhesive activity in K. pneumoniae consisted 100% and 85.0+/-5.6% of strains isolated from feces of patients with acute enteric infections reliably (p<0.05) exceeded values in individuals from control group.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - The extract of Hypericum ascyron L. induces bacterial cell death through apoptosis pathway.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum ascyron L. (H. ascyron L.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. Pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. In this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the H. ascyron L. extract was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of the H. ascyron L. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). To confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of H. ascyron L. extract on bacterial cells, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, TUNEL, and DNA laddering analysis were performed. RESULTS: Antibacterial effects of the H. ascyron L. extract were tested on Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of H. ascyron L. extract mainly included E. coli, S. aureus and M. luteus, especially M. luteus. The MBC value of H. ascyron L. extract on M. luteus was equal to the MIC (20mg/mL). H. ascyron L. extract could induce cells death of M. luteus through apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of H. ascyron L. Our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of H. ascyron L.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. Conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. METHODS: We used the SepsiTyper Kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Microflex, Bruker) directly from positive blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, FN/FA vials; bioMerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (VITEK 2; bioMerieux) for species identification. RESULTS: A total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. Culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (GPB) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. For GNB, the predominant species identified by MALDI-TOF and confirmed by VITEK were Escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and Enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. For GPB, predominant species were Staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and Enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. The median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with MALDI-TOF identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. CONCLUSION: Using MALDI-TOF directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Bacteriological Investigation of Chronic Wounds in a Specialized Wound Healing Department: A Retrospective Analysis of 107 Cases.
AB  - To investigate the information of chronic wounds, especially in the aspect of microbiological profile and to explore the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wounds infection, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 107 patients with chronic wounds from January 2011 to December 2013. The sociodemographic data, wound-related information, therapeutic type, and wound infection status were extracted. Microbial specimens were obtained and processed using standard hospital procedure for wound culture. The predominant pathogen isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 11, 26.2%), followed by Escherichia coli (n = 6, 14.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3, 7.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 7.1%). Sixty percent of the infectious chronic wounds had positive culture, and 96.2% of the noninfectious wounds had negative culture. In conclusion, the microbial characteristics were mostly in the site of lower extremity, gram-negative bacteria, and monopathogen, respectively. Furthermore, the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wound infection was not exactly coincident. It may be useful for guiding the empiric therapy of chronic wounds.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - [Antiadhesive potencial of Rhodococcus erythropolis IMB Ac-5017 biosurfactants].
AB  - The effect of Rhodococcus erythropolis IMB Ac-5017 biosurfactants (surface-active substances, SAS) with different degree of purification on attachment of bacteria (Escherichia coli IEM-1, Bacillus subtilis BT-2, Proteus vulgaris BT-1, Staphylococcus aureus BMC-1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P-55, Enterobacter cloacae AC-22, Erwinia aroidaeae B-433), yeasts (Candida albicans D-6) and fungi (Aspergillus niger P-3, Fusarium culmorum T-7) to the abiotic surfaces (glass, plastic, ceramics, steel, linoleum) was studied. The dependence of microorganisms adhesion on degree of SAS purification (supernatant, purified SAS solution), SAS concentration (0,04-1,25 mg/ml), type of surface and test-cultures was established. The adhesion of majority investigated bacterial cells after treatment of abiotic surfaces with supernatant of cultural liquid with SAS concentration 0,06-0,25 mg/ml was on the average 20-45, yeasts C. albicans D-6--30-75% and was less than that purified SAS solution with the same concentration. Higher antiadhesive activity of supernatant as compared to purified SAS solution testifies to possibility of exception of the expensive stage of isolation and purification at obtaining of preparations with antiadhesive properties.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of biotic and abiotic compartments of a hyperendemic Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) focus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of the microflora of the sand fly gut and the environmental distribution of these bacteria are important components for paratransgenic control of Leishmania transmission by sand flies. METHODS: Biotic and abiotic bacterial communities of four compartments of a hyper-endemic focus of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) were investigated using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction. These compartments include Phlebotomus papatasi's gut, skin and intestinal tract of great gerbil Rhombomys opimus, the gerbil nest supplies, and plant food sources of the vectors and reservoirs. RESULTS: Sequence homology analysis using nine available 16S rDNA data bases revealed 40, 24, 15 and 14 aerobic bacterial species from the vector guts, the gerbil bodies, the gerbil nests, and the plants, respectively. The isolated bacteria belong to wide ranges including aerobic to facultative anaerobic, pathogen to commensals, sand fly oviposition inducers, land to air and ocean habitats, animal and human probiotics, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. Matching data analysis suggested that the adult P. papatasi gut bacteria could be acquired from three routes, adult sugar feeding on the plant saps, adult blood feeding on the animal host, and larval feeding from nest supplies. However, our laboratory experiment showed that none of the bacteria of the reservoir skin was transmitted to female sand fly guts via blood feeding. The microflora of sand fly guts were associated with the sand fly environment in which the predominant bacteria were Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus in human dwellings, cattle farms, and rodent colonies, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacterium in sand fly guts. Presence of some sand fly ovipoisition inducers such Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus saprophyticus support association between gut flora and oviposition induction. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study showed that Bacillus subtilis and Enterobacter cloacae particularly subsp. dissolvens are circulated among the sand fly guts, the plants, and the sand fly larval breeding places and hence are possible candidates for a paratransgenic approach to reduce Leishmania transmission.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Evaluation of sorption capacity of antibiotics and antibacterial properties of a  cyclodextrin-polymer functionalized hydroxyapatite-coated titanium hip prosthesis.
AB  - Infection still present as one of common complications after total hip replacement ( approximately 2.5%), which may cause serious outcomes. For preventing such risk, loading antibiotics onto implants for increasing local drug concentration at targeted sites could be a solution. This study aims at modifying the surface of hydroxyapatite (HA) coated titanium hip implant material (Ti-HA) with polymer of cyclodextrin (polyCD) for loading antibiotics, to achieve a sustained local drug delivery. Two widely applied antibiotics (tobramycin and rifampicin) in orthopedic surgery were loaded alone or in combination. The drug adsorption isotherm, drug release kinetics and drug's efficacy were thoroughly investigated. The results proved that polyCD coating significantly improved the affinity of both drugs to Ti-HA surface, while the mechanism of drug-polyCD interaction varies from the nature of drug, courtesy of the structural complex of polyCD. The advantage of dual-drug loading was highlighted by its strong efficacy against both Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae, which overcomes the limitation of mono-drug loading for an effective treatment against both bacterial strains. The prolonged antibacterial activity of antibiotic loaded Ti-HA-polyCD samples confirmed that polyCD could be a promising drug-delivery system, for sustained antibiotics release or other potential applications e.g., antimitotic agent release.
TI  - Antimicrobial profiles of bacterial clinical isolates from the Gabonese National  Laboratory of Public Health: data from routine activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study is one of the first to provide a picture of antimicrobial resistance for a range of bacteria and antimicrobial classes in Gabon, Central Africa. METHODS: During the year 2010, 146 urine cytology, 143 blood cultures, 107 vaginal swabs, 23 urethral swabs, and 18 other culture examinations were positives. All isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-seven microorganisms were isolated: 210 enterobacteria, 166 staphylococci, 38 streptococci, 14 Acinetobacter, and nine Stenotrophomonas. Of the Klebsiella isolates, 18% and 30% were found to be resistant to selected third-generation cephalosporins (3CG) and fourth-generation cephalosporins (4CG), respectively. Sixty-seven percent of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Between 3% and 30% of E. coli isolates were resistant to selected 3CG. All Enterobacter cloacae isolates were sensitive to imipenem. Resistance to quinolones/fluoroquinolones was seen in 21-50% of E. coli isolates. Twenty-six percent of E. cloacae showed resistance to ceftazidime and 37% to cefotaxime. The resistance rate to quinolones ranged between 58% and 78%. Thirty-two percent of Staphylococcus isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Low resistance rates to teicoplanin (2-4%) were observed. Thirty-seven percent of isolated Staphylococcus aureus and 61% of isolated Staphylococcus saprophyticus were resistant to both penicillin G and oxacillin. Streptococcus isolates had low resistance rates to erythromycin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin (5%, 7%, and 14%, respectively) and were highly resistant to tetracycline, gentamicin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (92%, 91%, and 62%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance profiles seen here are of concern. To control the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, clinicians should be cognizant of their local antimicrobial resistance patterns.
TI  - [Pediatric tracheostomy: a ten-year analysis in the Intensive Care Unit of Sancti Spiritus Jose Marti Pediatric Teaching Hospital].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There has been a significant change in the role of pediatric tracheostomy over the last twenty years. Obstruction of the upper airway caused by infectious agents is no longer the leading cause of tracheostomy in children. Structural anomalies of the upper airway as well as the need for prolonged ventilator assistance have become the most frequent indication for pediatric tracheostomy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to assess the incidence, indications, complications, and role in mortality of tracheostomy in our pediatric population. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study of pediatric patients who underwent tracheostomy was conducted between 1999 and 2008 in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Jose Marti de Sancti Spiritus Pediatric Teaching Hospital in Cuba. RESULTS: Tracheostomy was performed in 14 patients during the period of the study (0.5% of admitted patients). Nine of them (64.2%) were younger than one year. The most frequent indication for the procedure was the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with neurologic disorders in 10 patients (71.42%). Upper airway malformations and acute infections were infrequent indications for tracheostomy. The most frequent complications were infectious in 10 patients (71.4%) and obstruction in four patients (28.5%). The following germs were found: Pseudomona aeruginosa in six patients (60%), Staphylococcus aureus in three patients (30%), and Enterobacter cloacae in three patients (30%). Furthermore, four patients were successfully decannulated (28.5%), five patients died (35.7%) but only in one (7.14%), death could be attributed to tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: The need for prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with neurologic disorders was the main indication for tracheostomy in our pediatric population; most of these children were younger than one year. The procedure had little impact in overall mortality in this group of patients.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Clinical epidemiological study on the incidence of Escherichia coli infections in the cancer patients admitted to Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013.
AB  - The aim of study was to identify pathogens involved in hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections in patients suffering from various types of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical epidemiological study included a group of 355 cancer patients admitted and operated at the Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013 was performed using data from hospital statistical service and the surgery and laboratory records, then processed by epidemi ological and statistical methods. RESULTS: In cancer patients the pathogen most commonly involved in infections was E. coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter. Analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of the pathogen most commonly involved revealed that of the 29 E. coli strains 22 were tested for resistance/sensitivity to ampicillin; of these, 19 strains showed resistance, and only 3 were sensitive; 14 E. coli strains of were resistant to cephalosporins and 8 sensitive; all strains tested were sensitive to carbapenems, imipenem or meropenem and polypeptides (colistin); the 10 tested strains showed resistance to monobactams (aztreonam). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was incriminated in most urinary tract infections, the other pathogens being identified sporadically. Surgical wound infections were caused mostly by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our study we encountered increased resistance of E. coli to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), fluoro-quinolones and tetracyclines.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Mentha longifolia L. and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from Mentha longifolia L. (M. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. (Z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of M. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. RESULTS: The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) were observed by the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of antibacterial resistant bacterial contaminants from mobile phones of hospital inpatients.
AB  - Mobile phones contaminated with bacteria may act as fomites. Antibiotic resistant bacterial contamination of mobile phones of inpatients was studied. One hundred and six samples were collected from mobile phones of patients admitted in various hospitals in Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. Eighty-nine (83.9%) out of 106 mobile phones were found to be contaminated with bacteria. Fifty-two (49.0%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 12 (11.3%) Staphylococcus aureus, 7 (6.6%) Enterobacter cloacae, 3 (2.83%) Pseudomonas stutzeri, 3 (2.83%) Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 2 (1.8%) Enterococcus faecalis and 10 (9.4%) aerobic spore bearers were isolated. All the isolated bacteria were found to be resistant to various antibiotics. Hence, regular disinfection of mobile phones of hospital inpatients is advised.
TI  - [Analysis of bacteriology of drug sensitivity in the inactive stage of chronic suppurative otitis media].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Detecting the sensitivities of bacterium in the inactive stage of chronic suppurative otitis media, to guide a clinical rational drug use after the type I tympanoplasty. METHOD: Collecting 148 hospitalized patients from Guangdong General Hospital diagnosed as inactive stage of chronic suppurative otitis media, who had been dry ear for more than 1 months. Analyse the results of drug sensitivity on the mucosa surfaces of the middle ear. RESULT: There are 16 species of bacterium, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae etc. Total positive rate of bacteria was 33.1%, the detectable rate of gram-positive bacteria was 69.4%, gram-negative bacteria was 30.6%. Drug sensitive test demonstrated that vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, rifampicin etc were effective in gram positive bacteria, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam etc were effective in gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: Patients with dry ears,who were going to take type I tympanoplasty, still had potential pathogens. Bacterial cultivation and drug sensitive test before operation can guide the clinical medication and prevent infection.
TI  - Indolent infection in nonunion of the distal femur.
AB  - In the treatment of nonunions of the distal femur, infection should be excluded.  However, it is difficult to determine whether the nonunion is infected or not with negative history and signs of infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate indolent infection as a cause of presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunion. All presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunions treated from 1998 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Any patient with suspected of having an infection clinically was excluded. Multiple tissue cultures were performed at the nonunion site. The main outcomes were to analyze the rate of positive cultures in presumptive aseptic distal femur nonunion and to compare the rate of secondary surgery in positive and negative culture groups. Of the 22 patients, 3 (13.6%) had positive culture results. The organisms cultured were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterobacter cloacae. The overall rate of infection was 9.1% (2/22), and one patient underwent a secondary procedure. In the open fracture group, 2 of 10 patients (20%) had positive cultures; all developed infection. In the closed fracture group, 1 of 12 patients (8.3%) had positive culture results, but Infection did not occur in the patient with a 3-week intravenous antibiotic treatment. The postoperative infection rate was 67% (2/3) in patients with positive intraoperative cultures, while 0% (0/18) in the group with negative intraoperative cultures (p<0.001). The presence of indolent infection can be verified in patients with presumptive aseptic nonunion of distal femoral fractures by obtaining intraoperative biopsy tissue cultures. Positive intraoperative culture results were related with postoperative infection.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (EO) of Lavandula coronopifolia from Morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), E-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). The oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1% and 4%. For most of the strains, the MIC value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of L. coronopifolia EO.
TI  - Trends in bacterial wound isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility in a pediatric burn hospital.
AB  - The purpose of this retrospective study was to collate data dealing with organisms cultured from the burn patients and evaluate trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. All cultures collected from each acute admission patient between 2004 and 2011 in the 30-bed pediatric burn hospital were evaluated for their annual frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. Duplicate cultures were excluded. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (25% of total isolates; range, 69-408 isolates/yr), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%; range, 40-202 isolates/yr), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%; range, 2-188 isolates/yr), Enterobacter cloacae (8%; range, 22-128 isolates/yr), and Escherichia coli (6%; range, 19-91 isolates/yr). This rank order remained relatively consistent during the period of study. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased from 20% in 2004 to about 45% in 2009 to 2011. Susceptibility to vancomycin was still 100%. In comparing periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011, P. aeruginosa showed increased susceptibility to cefepime (from 76% to 84%) and the aminoglycosides (from 68% to 81%), whereas susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam remained high (from 91% to 93%). E. cloacae demonstrated 90 to 100% susceptibility to aminoglycosides, cefepime, and imipenem. E. coli showed an increased rate of resistance to ceftazidime but was still susceptible to imipenem and amikacin. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa continue to be the most prevalent organisms cultured from our pediatric burn population. Almost half of the staphylococcal isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Despite widespread use of piperacillin-tazobactam, P. aeruginosa susceptibility remained high. Several classes of antimicrobials continued to demonstrate good to excellent activity against the majority of organisms cultured from the burn patients.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - Selective Antibiofilm Effects of Lucilia sericata Larvae Secretions/Excretions against Wound Pathogens.
AB  - Background. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT), using Lucilia sericata larvae, represents efficient, simple, and low-cost therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds. Aim. The aim was to investigate the antibiofilm activity of maggot excretions/secretions (ES) against biofilm of wound isolates Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae), and Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis). Methods. Quantification of biofilm formation, was carried out using a microtiter plate assay. Proteolytic activity of maggot ES was performed using skim milk agar plates. A solid phase extraction and reverse phase HPLC C18 chromatography were employed to the isolate of maggot ES antibiofilm compounds. Results. Maggot ES at 100 mg/mL concentration significantly reduced biofilm formation thus disrupting established biofilm of E. cloacae. Heat-treated ES did not show any antibiofilm activity towards E. cloacae. Similar results were obtained in the case of S. aureus; however, the heat-treatment of maggot ES did not affect its antibiofilm activity. Moreover, a compound with molecular weight of 25 kDa exhibiting antibiofilm activity was identified in maggot ES. On the other hand, maggot ES protected and even stimulated P. mirabilis biofilm formation. Conclusions. Our results suggest that maggot ES may act selectively against different bacterial strain.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  - Reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (PJIs). The purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of PJIs. A total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. The diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. The in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of PJIs using the disc diffusion method, E-tests((R)) and broth microdilution system. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were predominant microorganisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant, respectively. Only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. All staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. This paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. Hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.
TI  - Microbiology, risk factors and mortality of patients with intravenous catheter related blood stream infections in the surgical intensive care unit: a five-year, concurrent, case-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The epidemiologic data of catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI) is different in each type of Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The objectives were to identify microbiological patterns, risk factors and mortality analysis in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). MATERIAL AND METHOD: All CRBSI cases were reviewed in a 60-months period from the 1st ofJanuary, 2005 through the 31st of December, 2009. Two or three control patients, who had been catheterized within three days and were free of CRBSI, were randomly selected from the ICU admissions registration book as the control group; demographic data, mortality, organisms found and antibiotic sensitivity were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In the 5-years period, 44 patients were diagnosed with a CRBSI and 129 patients who were without a CRBSI were selected. The total infection rate was 1.31 per 1,000 catheter-days. Nine patients who contracted a CRBSI (20.4%) expired. A primary diagnosis of gastrointestinal problems had shown the greatest risk for developing a CRBSI (69.7%). In proportions of gram negative bacteria:gram positive bacteria:fungus, this was measured at 43:36:21 respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram positive bacteria found. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most common gram negative bacteria found. The chance of developing a CRBSI was significantly increased after 10 days of catheterization. The mortality probability of gram negative bacterial infections and fungal infections increased over time. This was in contrast to gram positive bacterial infections, which decreased over time despite having shown the highest possibility of death earlier in catheter days. As for multivariable analyses, catheterization of patients in the general wards was the sole independent risk factor of CRBSI occurrences (OR = 8.67, p < 0.01) and the males (OR = 7.20, p = 0.03) have shown the highest risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria related CRBSI was similar but the probability patterns of increasing the catheter days relating to CRBSI occurrence and mortality rates were different. Catheterization in the general wards was the only independent risk factor found for contracting a CRBSI in our institute. Males had the highest risk for mortality.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in green tea using a novel pretreatment method in a bioluminescence assay.
AB  - Tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world, and green tea has become a popular beverage in Western as well as Asian countries. A novel pretreatment method for a commercial bioluminescence assay to detect bacteria in green tea was developed and evaluated in this study. Pretreatment buffers with pH levels ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 were selected from MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid), HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid), or Tricine buffers. To evaluate the effect of pretreatment and the performance of the assay, serially diluted cultures of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested. The improved methods, which consisted of a pretreatment of the sample in alkaline buffer, significantly decreased the background bioluminescence intensity of green tea samples when compared with the conventional method. Pretreatment with alkaline buffers with pH levels ranging from 8.0 to 9.0 increased the bioluminescence intensities of cultures of E. cloacae and S. aureus. Strong log-linear relationships between the bioluminescence intensities and plate counts emerged for the tested strains. Furthermore, the microbial detection limit was 15 CFU in 500 ml of bottled green tea after an 8-h incubation at 35 degrees C and an assay time of 1 h. The results showed that contaminated samples could be detected within 1 h of operation using our improved bioluminescence assay. This method could be used to test for contamination during the manufacturing process as well as for statistical sampling for quality control.
TI  - Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  - The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.
TI  - Poor utility of serum interleukin-6 levels to predict indolent periprosthetic shoulder infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection after shoulder arthroplasty can present a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 69 patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at one institution. All patients underwent a standard preoperative and intraoperative workup for infection, which included shoulder aspirate culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, tissue culture, and frozen section analysis. In addition, serum levels of IL-6 were measured preoperatively in all patients. Infection classification was divided into 4 groups, (1) definite, (2) probable, (3) possible, and (4) no infection, on the basis of previously reported criteria using intraoperative cultures and preoperative and intraoperative findings of infections. RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, 24 were classified as having a definite or probable infection. Propionibacterium acnes was the offending organism for the majority of these cases (20 of 24, 83%). IL-6 was not a sensitive marker of infection for these patients (sensitivity: 3 of 24, 12%; specificity: 3 of 45, 93%). The sensitivity of serum IL-6 was lower compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sensitivity: 10 of 24, 42%; specificity: 37 of 45, 82%) and C-reactive protein level (sensitivity: 11 of 24, 46%; specificity: 42 of 45, 93%). For the non-P. acnes cases (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species), the sensitivity of IL-6 was 25% (1 of 4). CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 is not an effective marker for diagnosis of infection in shoulder arthroplasty. On the basis of this large prospective study, we do not recommend its use as a preoperative diagnostic test in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.
TI  - Pathogen characteristics reveal novel antibacterial approaches for interstitial lung disease.
AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a clinical disorder associated with changes of lung structure. Concurrent infection is a serious complication and one of the major factors that exacerbates ILD. Pathogen screening is a critical step in early diagnosis and proper treatment of ILD with secondary infection. Here we analyzed distribution and drug susceptibility of pathogens isolated from hospitalized ILD patients from January, 2007 to December, 2008 and compared them to bacterial drug resistance data in CHINET during the same period. The main specimens were from sputum culture, lavage fluid culture, lung biopsy tissue culture, and pleural effusion culture and bacterial or fungal cultures were performed on these specimens accordingly. Drug susceptibility was tested for positive bacterial cultures using disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer method) and E Test strips in which results were determined based on the criteria of CLSI (2007). A total of 371 pathogen strains from ILD patients, including 306 bacterial strains and 65 fungal strains were isolated and cultured. Five main bacterial strains and their distribution were as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), Acinetobacter (12.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (8.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7.8%). The results showed that ILD patients who had anti-infection treatment tended to have Gram-negative bacteria, whether they acquired an infection in the hospital or elsewhere. Drug resistance screening indicated that aminoglycosides and carbapenems had lower antibiotic resistance rates. In addition, we found that the usage of immunosuppressants was associated with the increased infection rate and number of pathogens that were isolated. In conclusion, aminoglycosides and carbapenems may be selected as a priority for secondary infection to control ILD progression. Meanwhile, the use of anti-MRSA/MRCNS drugs may be considered for Staphylococcus infection.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. METHODS: A single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. Patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from January 2011 to June 2013. The average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). Sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). Of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. A number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. Fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. Eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. The use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. Large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. Clinical non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their MICs of tigecycline alone and in combination with PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. With one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of PPIs on tigecycline activity. The MIC changes after PPIs addition correlated with the PPIs concentrations in the test media. Compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. The time-kill study confirmed that the addition of PPIs could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Even at low concentration (5 mg/L) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in E. cloacae and E. faecalis strains. We conclude that In vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of PPIs in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - [Biological properties of opportunistic microorganisms--agents of acute intestinal infections].
AB  - The etiological role of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in acute intestinal infections in the Sumy region has been studied. It is established, that the strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae isolated from patients with acute intestinal infection were characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity. In 85.0 +/- 5.6% of the studied strains of K. pneumoniae, 30.0 +/- 7.2% of E. cloacae, 20.0 +/- 5.6% S. Aureus the authors have identified pathogenicity factors, which ensure their ability to adhesion and persistence (antiinterferon and anticomplement activity).
TI  - Epidemiological and bacteriological profiles in children with burns.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study is to determine the most prevalent bacteria responsible for nosocomial infection (NI) in burned children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analytic study was conducted over a period of 30 months at the Children's Hospital of Tunisia. All burned children were enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 185 children were hospitalised during the study period. The mean age was 30 months (interquartile range, IR:18; 48). The gender ratio of the study population was 1.3 (104 males and 81 females). The mean total body surface area burned (TBSA) was 10% (IR:6; 16). The incidence rate of NI was 39.1 NIs per 1000 patient-days and two-thirds of the infections were polymicrobial. The most common isolated micro-organisms were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 57.7%), wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.9%) and wild-type Enterobacter cloacae (26.9%). The case fatality rate was 5.9% corresponding to a crude death rate of 1.32 deaths per year. Septic shock with multiple organ failure was the leading cause of death. CONCLUSION: The most common micro-organisms responsible for NI in our series were of the wild-type phenotype. Thus, on suspicion of sepsis, empiric antibiotic treatment combining piperacillin, oxacillin and gentamicin can be proposed until identification of the causative microorganism is available.
TI  - Change of antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST: influence on cumulative hospital antibiograms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether the change in antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST influenced cumulative antibiograms in a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities of non-duplicate isolates collected within a one-year period before (period A) and after (period B) changing AST interpretation from CLSI 2009 to EUCAST 1.3 (2011) guidelines were analysed. In addition, period B isolates were reinterpreted according to the CLSI 2009, CLSI 2013 and EUCAST 3.1 (2013) guidelines. RESULTS: The majority of species/drug combinations showed no differences in susceptibility rates comparing periods A and B. However, in some gram-negative bacilli, decreased susceptibility rates were observed when comparing CLSI 2009 with EUCAST 1.3 within period B: Escherichia coli / cefepime, 95.8% (CLSI 2009) vs. 93.1% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.005; Enterobacter cloacae / cefepime, 97.0 (CLSI 2009) vs. 90.5% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.012; Pseudomonas aeruginosa / meropenem, 88.1% (CLSI 2009) vs. 78.3% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.002. These differences were still evident when comparing susceptibility rates according to the CLSI 2013 guideline with EUCAST 3.1 guideline. For P. aeruginosa and imipenem, a trend towards a lower antibiotic susceptibility rate in ICUs compared to general wards turned into a significant difference after the change to EUCAST: 87.9% vs. 79.8%, P=0.08 (CLSI 2009) and 86.3% vs. 76.8%, P=0.048 (EUCAST 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: The change of AST guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST led to a clinically relevant decrease of susceptibility rates in cumulative antibiograms for defined species/drug combinations, particularly in those with considerable differences in clinical susceptibility breakpoints between the two guidelines.
TI  - An analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1B with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  - Hymenochirin-1B (IKLSPETKDN(10)LKKVLKGAIK(20)GAIAVAKMV.NH2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the Congo clawed frog Hymenochirus boettgeri (Pipidae). Structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the Pro(5), Glu(6) and Asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. Although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. Increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1B while reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less hemolytic. [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a range of Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC in the range 0.8-3.1 muM) and NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii (MIC in the range 3.1-6.25 muM), and low hemolytic activity (LC50=302 muM). [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B, at a concentration of 2.5 muM, significantly (P<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-17.
TI  - Bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting Mn3O4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  - Self-supported Mn3O4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. In one direction, Mn3O4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction Mn3O4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. These two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for Gram positive bacteria, but for Gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. Magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial Mn3O4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (Ms) at low temperature.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - [Analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. METHODS: The bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in 17 cities. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 CLSI guideline. RESULTS: Among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for Gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for Gram negative strains, respectively. The isolating rate of MRSA was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). The MRCNS proportions were similar across the 3 periods. One (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis were found. Although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. The results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (IV), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. ESBL-harboring strains in E. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. ESBL-producing strains in Klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. Except that the sensitive rate of Enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. Acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). One strain (1.0%, 1/99) of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: We are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. Carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. Strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  - Although Gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. Seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] isolate, 1 Escherichia coli isolate, 1 Enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 Bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. Each infection was comprised of at least one S. aureus isolate with a MIC of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one Enterobacteriaceae isolate with a MIC of 1 or 4 mug/ml. Eight of 16 infections also included B. fragilis, with a MIC of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. Efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 CFU from the level of 0-h controls. Efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against Enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against S. aureus and B. fragilis isolates. These bacterial reductions correlate with free drug concentration above the MIC (fT>MIC) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at MICs of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. The humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. These data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.
TI  - Early-onset sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit in Beni Suef, Egypt: bacterial isolates and antibiotic resistance pattern.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the frequency of bacterial isolates in early-onset neonatal  sepsis (EONS) and their antimicrobial resistance pattern. METHODS: A retrospective study of EONS was conducted at the Beni Suef University Hospital from September 2008 to September 2012. A case of EONS was defined as an infant who had clinical signs of infection or who was born to a mother with risk factors for infection, and in whom blood culture obtained within 72 hours of life grew a bacterial pathogen. RESULTS: Of 673 neonates screened, there were 138 positive blood cultures (20.5%) (confirmed EONS). Of the recovered isolates, 86.2% were gram-negative pathogens. Klebsiella pneumoniae (42.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (13.8%) were the commonest isolated organisms. The most common gram-positive microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus accounting for only 12 isolates (8.7%). All Klebsiella isolates and 93% of Enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Gram-negative pathogens had the maximum overall sensitivity to imipenem, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin; whereas, gram-positive isolates were most susceptible to vancomycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae was the predominant causative bacteria of EONS followed by E. cloacae and E. coli. There was a high resistance to ampicillin. Imipenem had the maximum overall activity against the causative bacteria. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the changing epidemiology of pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Characterization of ribosomal binding and antibacterial activities using two orthogonal high-throughput screens.
AB  - We report here the affinity and antibacterial activity of a structurally similar  class of neomycin dimers. The affinity of the dimer library for rRNA was established by using a screen that measures the displacement of fluorescein-neomycin (F-neo) probe from RNA. A rapid growth inhibition assay using a single drug concentration was used to examine the antibacterial activity. The structure-activity relationship data were then rapidly analyzed using a two-dimensional ribosomal binding-bacterial inhibition plot analysis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - [Assessment of persistent potential dominant pathogens of acute intestinal infections].
AB  - To determine the prevalence,and etiological structure of acute intestinal infections, to investigate the dominant agents' persistence factors. According with materials of statistical reports we did the retrospective epidemiological analysis of acute intestinal infections incidence in Sumy region from 2006 till 2011. Biological properties of 40 strains of Klebsiella pneumonia, 40 strains of Enterobacter cloacae and 50 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. Moderate trend of acute intestinal infections incidence increase was indicated. Bacteria of genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus were predominated in etiological structure. Incidence of acute diarrheal infections caused by Klebsiella and Enterobacter was reached the maximum in the spring-summer period. The incidence of staphylococcal etiology was discrete. The strains of Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae were remarkable for different frequency and intensity of persistence factors. capital A, Cyrillicnti-interferon activity was detected in 100% of clinical isolates of microorganisms, anti-lysozym activity was detected in 87.3 +/- 2.9% of clinical isolates of microorganisms, anti-complementary activity was detected in 72.3 +/- 3.9% of clinical isolates of microorganisms. Biological properties of opportunistic pathogens that cause acute intestinal infections can be used as epidemiological factors for differentiation of microorganisms pathogenicity.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Necrotizing pneumonia following cardiac surgery in a neonate.
AB  - In this report, we discuss the case of a male neonate who underwent surgical correction for coarctation of the aorta. The recovery of this patient was complicated by postsurgical necrotizing pneumonitis that resolved completely after a prolonged hospital stay with recurrent deterioration.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - Changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (CANWARD 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse Canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. METHODS: All isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual CANWARD surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. A multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. RESULTS: The proportion of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (P = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (P > 0.05). Among isolates of S. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. Notably, MDR isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of doripenem plus fosfomycin against drug-resistant clinical blood isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doripenem in combination with fosfomycin was evaluated against a wide range of clinical blood isolates. Bacterial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 39), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 18), multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (n = 10), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5) were investigated. For synergism testing the checkerboard test was applied and determined by calculation of the fractional inhibitory concentration index. Checkerboard results were verified by time-kill curve tests on selected isolates. Among MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 94.9, 80 and 100% of isolates demonstrated synergism, respectively. Selected isolates demonstrated synergism in time-kill curve tests. P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated no interaction in all isolates. Doripenem plus fosfomycin shows high efficacy with promising results in vitro.
TI  - Successful treatment of pump pocket infection after left ventricular assist device implantation by negative pressure wound therapy and omental transposition.
AB  - A 52-year-old man suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy underwent implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion as a bridge to transplantation. He presented with evidence of LVAD-related mediastinitis and pump pocket infection 57 days after the LVAD implantation. The mediastinum was reopened and irrigated. A large amount of pus was observed around the outflow and inflow conduits and in the pump pocket. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was initiated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from blood and mediastinal pus. Enterobacter cloacae was also isolated by mediastinal pus culture after the beginning of the NPWT. Three weeks after the start of the NPWT, the pus culture became negative, and omental transposition and sternal closure were performed. Intravenous antibiotics were administered until day 42, with the treatment subsequently switched to oral antibiotics. He was discharged from the hospital on day 57 and followed up at the outpatient clinic. Our findings suggest that NPWT followed by omental transposition be useful to treat mediastinitis or pump pocket infection after implantable LVAD insertion.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - More potency assay results for generic non-USA lots of piperacillin/tazobactam and initial reports for generic meropenem compounds marketed in the USA.
AB  - An ongoing program of international generic antimicrobial potency assays for piperacillin/tazobactam has been summarized here through December 2010, and the initial results for meropenem generic lots from the United States are also presented. Fifteen additional piperacillin/tazobactam generic lots revealed an average of -10% activity (range, +3 to -23%) compared to the branded product (Zosyn(R); Wyeth-Pfizer), a finding consistent with prior reports (46 lots) of -16%. In contrast, meropenem branded and generic products had equivalent assay results (5 generic lots from 2 manufacturers [Hospira and Sandoz]). In conclusion, potencies for generic lots of parenteral broad-spectrum beta-lactams can vary widely when directly compared to branded products, requiring documentation by chemical, in vitro activity (potency assays as measured here), and purity testing before considering their addition to a hospital formulary.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal ICU of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. For the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. AIM: To study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study which was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at SGRDIMSAR, Amritsar, during June 2011 to June 2012. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n=68), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (n=30), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=05), Enterobacter cloacae (n=04), Citrobacter diversus (n=02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and Candida (n=01). Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis. On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. The resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. A majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. CONCLUSION: The present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline-avibactam tested against clinical isolates  collected from U.S. Medical Centers in 2010-2011.
AB  - Ceftaroline-avibactam and comparator agents were tested by the broth microdilution method against 20,089 isolates consecutively collected in 2010 and 2011 from 75 U.S. medical centers. Ceftaroline-avibactam was active against Enterobacteriaceae (4,908 strains; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml; highest MIC, 4 mug/ml), including meropenem-nonsusceptible Klebsiella spp. and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae strains (MIC90, 1 mug/ml for both). Ceftaroline-avibactam was also active against ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.25 mug/ml) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(90), 1 mug/ml).
TI  - Pathogen diagnosis of children sepsis by LAMP technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a rapid diagnostic method in neonatal sepsis and bacterial  meningitis. METHODS: The primers were designed and synthesized based on 16S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Four specimens of Staphylococcus aureus, 16 specimens of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 specimens of Enterococci, 3 specimens of Streptococcus, 1 specimen of Micrococcus, 3 specimens of Escherichia coli, 4 specimens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 specimens of Enterobacter cloacae, and 5 specimens of Acinetobacter were tested by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A total of 118 clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were collected and detected with both LAMP assay and blood culture. RESULTS: By designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: As a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae pyomyositis complicating chronic granulomatous disease and review of gram-negative bacilli pyomyositis.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a primary purulent infection of skeletal muscles mostly described  in tropical areas. Staphylococcus aureus is by far the main causative microorganisms. In temperate areas, pyomyositis more frequently affects male adults with immunodeficiency. Gram-negative bacilli pyomyositis are uncommon and occur mainly in this context of immunodeficiency. Only one case of Enterobacter cloacae pyomyositis has been reported so far. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a rare inherited immunodeficiency characterized by a loss of NADPH oxidase activity in phagocytic cells that favors infections due to catalase-positive microorganisms. Pyomyositis has only been described once as a complication of CGD. We report here a case of Enterobacter cloacae-associated pyomyositis of the left thigh in a patient with CGD, and review the literature on Gram-negative pyomyositis.
TI  - Microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in Central Alabama.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. They are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. The purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in Central Alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. This was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile at this Central Alabama hospital. The survey period was between July 2009 and June 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed and susceptibility testing was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution method. The results indicated that Escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). For the 215 E. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, P < 0.05). In contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, P < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this Central Alabama hospital. Additionally, this study found that E. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (Lee et al. 2010; Rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. It is imperative to monitor the resistance of P. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.
TI  - [Common pathogens and clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study common pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility as well  as clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective study on neonatal pneumonia was performed. The study investigated antibiotic susceptibility of four common pathogens (339 strains) that caused neonatal pneumonia. Clinical characteristics of the newborns with pneumonia were analyzed. Of the 339 strains, 185 were isolated from bronchial secretions, 72 from blood samples, and 82 with positive results of both samples. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-four neonates with pneumonia presented positive results of bacterial culture. the most common pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (21.9%), Escherichia coli (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.0%) and Enterobacter cloacae (11.4%). The birth weight of newborns infected with Staphylococcus aureus was generally normal, and the time of hospital admission was later (after 24 hours of life). In contrast, the newborns with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, had lower birth weights and early time of hospital admission (within 24 hours of life). Nearly more than 50% gram-negative bacteria were resistant to second, third and forth generation cephaloporins. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are predominant pathogens of neonatal pneumonia. Neonatal pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria is common in newborns with low birth weight and its onset time is relatively earlier. Gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal pneumonia are highly resistant to cephaloporins.
TI  - Surgical site infections following transcatheter apical aortic valve implantation: incidence and management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to examine the incidence and management of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients submitted to transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TA-TAVI). METHODS: From April 2007 to December 2011, 154 patients underwent TA-TAVI with an Edwards Sapien bioprosthesis (ES) at the Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et Pneumologie de Quebec (IUCPQ) as part of a multidisciplinary program to prospectively evaluate percutaneous aortic valve implantation. Patient demographics, perioperative variables, and postoperative complications were recorded in a prospective registry. RESULTS: Five (3.2%) patients in the cohort presented with an SSI during the study period. The infections were all hospital-acquired (HAI) and were considered as organ/space SSI's based on Center for Disease Control criteria (CDC). Within the first few weeks of the initial procedure, these patients presented with an abscess or chronic draining sinus in the left thoracotomy incision and were re-operated. The infection spread to the apex of the left ventricle in all cases where pledgeted mattress sutures could be seen during debridement. Patients received multiple antibiotic regimens without success until the wound was surgically debrided and covered with viable tissue. The greater omentum was used in three patients and the pectoralis major muscle in the other two. None of the patients died or had a recurrent infection. Three of the patients were infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, one with Staphylococcus aureus, and one with Enterobacter cloacae. Patients with surgical site infections were significantly more obese with higher BMI (31.4+/-3.1 vs 26.2+/-4.4 p=0.0099) than the other patients in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: While TA-TAVI is a minimally invasive technique, SSIs, which are associated with obesity, remain a concern. Debridement and rib resection followed by wound coverage with the greater omentum and/or the pectoralis major muscle were used successfully in these patients.
TI  - Verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential PCR gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., Candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) microbiology laboratory. Five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. DNA extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. Monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except Enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), Ac. baumannii (57%) and Ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). All clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two Ac. baumannii, two Klebsiella oxytoca and two Candida parapsilosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex LATE-PCR assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. The multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with DNA extracted from 70 different target strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the potential of LATE-PCR to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. Results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.
TI  - The target of daptomycin is absent from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  - Antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. When these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against Gram negatives. Here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent from E. coli and other Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Four new sesquiterpenoids from Ligularia cymbulifera.
AB  - Four new highly oxygenated bisabolane sesquiterpenoids were obtained from the EtOH extract from Ligularia cymbulifera, and their structures were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Their relative configurations were clarified by a detailed analysis of (1)H NMR coupling constants, nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) experiments and two-dimensional NMR spectra. These four new compounds were assayed for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as against one human pathogenic fungus.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Antibiotics involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: a nationwide multilevel study suggests differences within antibiotic classes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the antibiotics potentially the most involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from an ecological perspective in French healthcare facilities (HCFs). METHODS: This study was based on data from the French antimicrobial surveillance network (ATB-RAISIN, 2007-09). Antibiotics were expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were considered as count data adjusted for patient-days. These were third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ceftazidime-, imipenem- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three-level negative binomial regression models were built to take into account the hierarchical structure of data: level 1, repeated measures each year (count outcome, time, antibiotics); level 2, HCFs (type and size); and level 3, regions (geographical area). RESULTS: A total of 701 HCFs from 20 French regions and up to 1339 HCF-years were analysed. The use of ceftriaxone, but not of cefotaxime, was positively correlated with incidence rates of 3GC- and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli. In contrast, both 3GCs were positively correlated with the incidence rate of cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae. Higher levels of use of ciprofloxacin and/or ofloxacin, but not of levofloxacin, were associated with higher incidence rates of 3GC- and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and ceftazidime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests differences within antibiotic classes in promoting antibiotic resistance. We identified ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin as priority targets in public health strategies designed to reduce antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in French HCFs.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Non-cytotoxic antibacterial silver-coumarin complex doped sol-gel coatings.
AB  - Microbial colonisation on clinical and industrial surfaces is currently of global concern and silane based sol-gel coatings are being proposed as potential solutions. Sol-gels are chemically inert, stable and homogeneous and can be designed to act as a reservoir for releasing antimicrobial agents over extended time periods. In the present study, silver nitrate (AgN) and a series of silver coumarin complexes based on coumarin-3-carboxylatosilver (AgC) and it is 6, 7 and 8 hydroxylated analogues (Ag6, Ag7, Ag8) were incorporated into sol-gel coatings. The comparative antibacterial activity of the coatings was determined against meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistance Enterobacter cloacae WT6. The percentage growth inhibitions were found in the range of 9.2 (+/-2.7)-66.0 (+/-1.2)% at low silver loadings of 0.3% (w/w) with E. cloacae being the more susceptible. Results showed that among the Ag coumarin complexes, the Ag8 doped coating had the highest antibiofilm property. XPS confirmed the presence of silver in the nanoparticulate state (Ag(0)) at the coating surface where it remained after 4 days of exposure to bacterial culture. Comparative cytotoxicity studies revealed that the Ag-complex coatings were less toxic than the AgN coating. Thus, it can be concluded that a sol-gel matrix with Ag-coumarin complexes may provide non-toxic surfaces with antibacterial properties.
TI  - Catheter-related complications in cancer patients on home parenteral nutrition: a prospective study of over 51,000 catheter days.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in these patients. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related complications in cancer patients on HPN. METHODS: All adult cancer patient candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and P < .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (P < .04) and thrombosis (P < .001). VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation (P < .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate and shorter dwell time; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, HPN can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - Essential oil of the leaves of Ricinus communis L.: in vitro cytotoxicity and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to appraise the antimicrobial activity of Ricinus communis L. essential oil against different pathogenic microorganisms and the cytotoxic activity against HeLa cell lines. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of Ricinus communis L. essential oil against 12 bacterial and 4 fungi strains. The disc diameters of zone of inhibition (DD), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the concentration inhibiting 50% (IC50) were investigated to characterize the antimicrobial activities of this essential oil. The in vitro cytotoxicity of Ricinus communis L. essential oil was examined using a modified MTT assay; the viability and the IC50 were used to evaluate this test. RESULTS: The essential oil from the leaves of Ricinus communis L. was analyzed by GC-MS and bioassays were carried out. Five constituents of the oil were identified by GC-MS. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was investigated in order to evaluate its efficacy against twelve bacteria and four fungi species, using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration methods. The essential oil showed strong antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms tested with higher sensitivity for Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the essential oil on HeLa cell lines were examined by MTT assay. The cytotoxicity of the oil was quite strong with IC50 values less than 2.63 mg/ml for both cell lines. CONCLUSION: The present study showed the potential antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties of the essential oil of Ricinus communis L., indicating the possibilities of its potential use in the formula of natural remedies for the topical treatment of infections.
TI  - High incidence of bloodstream infection due to gram-negative bacilli in patients  with pulmonary hypertension receiving intravenous treprostinil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An excessive risk for bacteremia has recently been reported in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treated with intravenous treprostinil. We aimed to assess this association in a cohort of patients from a Spanish referral center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study that included 55 patients diagnosed with PAH who received a continuous intravenous infusion of a prostanoid (epoprostenol or treprostinil) for >/=1month at our center between January 1991 and December 2011. The risk factors associated with the incidence of bacteremia were analyzed with the log-rank test. RESULTS: After a total follow-up of 64,453 treatment days, we found 12 episodes of bacteremia: Staphylococcus aureus (5 episodes), non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (4 episodes), other gram-positive cocci (2 episodes), and Enterobacter cloacae (one episode). The incidence of bacteremia was 0.118 episodes per 1,000 treatment days in patients receiving epoprostenol versus 0.938 episodes per 1,000 treatment-days in patients receiving treprostinil (P=.0037). All episodes of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacilli were diagnosed in patients on treprostinil. In the univariate analysis the treatment with intravenous treprostinil was associated with the incidence of bacteremia (hazard ratio: 4.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.24-14.53), although the low number of events prevented us from performing a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with intravenous treprostinil is associated with a higher risk for bacteremia, especially due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. This association should be taken in consideration when choosing empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with PAH and sepsis.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BMK2005, an intestinal isolate active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - A strain of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BMK2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. Among them, 13 strains belonging to species of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to Cefotaxime (CTX) and Ceftazidime (CAZ), and 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to Methicillin (MRSA). This antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as Paracaseicin A. It was heat-stable up to 120 degrees C for 5 min and active within the pH range of 2-5. Its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. This bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. Its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 Da. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a L. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (AAD).
TI  - Causative bacteria and antibiotic resistance in neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by Escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. Acinetobacter species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebseila, Streptococci, Enterobacter cloacae and Morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. In most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). There was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. Gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). Quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. Vancomycin was found to be effective in 100% cases of Staphylococcus group. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and Escherichia coli are the most common gram negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. Continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.
TI  - Infections from CVC in the pediatric neoplastic patient. Single institution experience.
AB  - AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2010].
AB  - We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and antibiotics.
AB  - Synergistic activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were evaluated. Interactions between plant extracts and antibiotics were tested by checkerboard method and interpreted as FIC index. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were used. Salvia officinalis showed better synergistic capacity than Cichorium intybus. Synergistic interactions were observed between amoxicillin and acetone or ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis and between chloramphenicol and ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration (1/4 MIC to 1/32 MIC) of sage extracts, the MIC values of antibiotics were decreased by 2- to 10-fold. Synergism was observed against all test bacteria, except Escherichia coli. The combinations of acetone and ethyl acetate extract from Cichorium intybus and antibiotics resulted in additive and indifferent effects against tested bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Targeting pan-resistant bacteria with antibodies to a broadly conserved surface polysaccharide expressed during infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New therapeutic targets for antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens  are desperately needed. The bacterial surface polysaccharide poly-beta-(1-6)-N-acetyl-glucosamine (PNAG) mediates biofilm formation by some bacterial species, and antibodies to PNAG can confer protective immunity. By analyzing sequenced genomes, we found that potentially multidrug-resistant bacterial species such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) may be able to produce PNAG. Among patients with cystic fibrosis patients, highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the BCC have emerged as problematic pathogens, providing an impetus to study the potential of PNAG to be targeted for immunotherapy against pan-resistant bacterial pathogens. METHODS: The presence of PNAG on BCC was assessed using a combination of bacterial genetics, microscopy, and immunochemical approaches. Antibodies to PNAG were tested using opsonophagocytic assays and for protective efficacy against lethal peritonitis in mice. RESULTS: PNAG is expressed in vitro and in vivo by the BCC, and cystic fibrosis patients infected by the BCC species B. dolosa mounted a PNAG-specific opsonophagocytic antibody response. Antisera to PNAG mediated opsonophagocytic killing of BCC and were protective against lethal BCC peritonitis even during coinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise potential new therapeutic options against PNAG-producing bacteria, including even pan-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from Larrea tridentata.
AB  - Three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from Larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. Results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 microg/mL) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 12.5-50 microg/mL); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), as well as sensitive (MIC 50 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 25 microg/mL). 3'-Demethoxy-6-O-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant S. aureus (MIC 25 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC 50 microg/mL), E. cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL). 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against M. tuberculosis MDR strains having MIC values of 25 and 25-50 microg/mL, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against S. aureus (MIC 50 microg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 50 microg/mL). We concluded that lignan 3 is the main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of L. tridentata. Lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. On the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in L. tridentata.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial activity and resistance to oxidation of moringa peregrina seed oil.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the oil extracted with n-hexane from the seeds of Moringa peregrina was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The oil proved effective against all of the tested microorganisms. Standard antibiotics (netilmycin, 5-flucytocine, intraconazole and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid) were used for comparison. The resistance to oxidation of the extracted seed oil was also determined.
TI  - Kinetics and morphology of polymicrobial biofilm formation on polypropylene mesh.
AB  - We examined the ability of three clinical bacterial isolates to form mixed biofilms on surgical polypropylene mesh (PPM) in vitro. The three strains--Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterobacter cloacae--were isolated from a patient with an infected PPM. Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis (alone and in combination) were inoculated into culture containing squares of PPM and allowed to attach and propagate into mature biofilms. Enterococcus faecalis initially attached to the mesh in greater numbers; however, 7 days postinoculation, there were more S. aureus cells attached, indicating that in vitro S. aureus is the out-competing species. All three isolates were then co-cultured to form mature biofilms on mesh, and the biofilms were examined by confocal microscopy using both Live/Dead staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Imaging revealed a dense biofilm structure with interstitial voids and channels; rods and cocci were interspersed throughout the biofilm, indicating bacterial coexistence in close proximity. FISH revealed staphylococci and enterococci adjacent to each other and also to the Enterobacter, distinguishable by its rod morphology. These studies show that different species can co-operatively form mature biofilms on mesh but that the relative abundance of a species within the biofilm may vary over time.
TI  - [Trends of bacterial resistance phenotypes in high-complexity public and private  hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the frequency of bacterial resistance phenotypes  of microorganisms obtained from patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other (non-ICU) high-complexity public and private hospital services in Colombia. METHODS: A retrospective observational, analytical, multicenter study was conducted. The records from January 2007 to December 2009 on bacterial isolates and bacterial resistance phenotypes of microorganisms obtained from ICU and non-ICU patients in 79 high-complexity public and private hospitals were consolidated. The information was analyzed with the WHONET((R)) 5.5 (WHO) software, following the 2009 recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and summarized on an Excel((R)) spreadsheet. A descriptive analysis with the calculation of proportions was performed. The trends were analyzed with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The 2007-2009 trends for bacterial resistance phenotypes show increased percentages of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae, ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (r = 1, P < 0.01), and reduced percentages of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (r = -1, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The trend analysis presented in this study is the baseline for establishing a national epidemiological surveillance subsystem. The trends observed reveal that bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs in hospitals in Colombia is a dynamic phenomenon, with evidence of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae phenotypes in the hospitals.
TI  - [Capability of national reference laboratories in Latin America to detect emerging resistance mechanisms].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of 17 national reference laboratories participating in the Latin American Quality Control Program in Bacteriology and Antibiotic Resistance (LA-EQAS) to detect emerging resistance mechanisms- namely: resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems due to the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) type IMP, and intermediate resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus-VISA). METHODS: The following three isolates were sent to the 17 participating LA-EQAS laboratories: KPC -producing Klebsiella pneumoniae PAHO-161, IMP-producing Enterobacter cloacae PAHO-166, and S. aureus PAHO-165 with intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Performance of each of the following operations was evaluated: interpretation of sensitivity tests, detection of the resistance mechanism, and assessment of either inhibition halo size (disk diffusion method) or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). RESULTS: Concordance in the detection of resistance mechanisms was 76.4%, 73.3%, and 66.7% for the K. pneumoniae PAHO-161, E. cloacae PAHO-166, and S. aureus PAHO-165 strains, respectively. Concordance between the inhibition areas observed by the participating laboratories and the ranges established by the coordinating laboratory was acceptable for all three isolates, at 90.8%, 92.8%, and 88.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall concordance in on the detection of KPC, MBL, and VISA resistance mechanisms was 72.1%. We consider the national reference laboratories in Latin America capable of recognizing these emerging resistance mechanisms and expect that maximum levels of concordance will be reached in the future.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Analysis of scalp wound infections among craniocerebral trauma patients following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - AIM: To explore the causes of scalp wound infection, pathogen distribution, characteristics of antimicrobial susceptibility and therapeutic measures following craniocerebral trauma caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. MATERIAL and METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the microbiology records of patients admitted with craniocerebral trauma to the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Scalp wound infections following craniocerebral trauma were caused by the Wenchuan earthquake. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients suffered from scalp trauma in this study, including 52.4% cases (43/82) with wound infections, mostly accompanied by severe foreign body contamination, for which the time of first debridement was significantly delayed. There were 59 strains of infectious pathogenic bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were the most common organisms found (64.4%), including strains of Staphylococcus aureus (26/59, 44.1%) and strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis (12/59, 20.3%). Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 35.6% of samples: 22.0% (13/59) were strains of Enterobacter cloacae; 5.1% (3/59) were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae; and 8.5% (5/59) were strains of Serratia rubidaea. CONCLUSION: The rate of scalp wound infections following earthquake-induced craniocerebral trauma, which was dominated by Grampositive Staphylococcus aureus infection, has been markedly elevated in recent years. Early debridement and suturing, nutritional support and application of sensitive antibiotics can augment the therapeutic effect.
TI  - Endowashers: an overlooked risk for possible post-endoscopic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of post-endoscopy infections is an important objective to  assure patient safety. Endowashers, or high throughput irrigation water pumps, are a frequently used device on endoscopes. Recommendations published by professional bodies and regulatory health agencies cover not only adequate reprocessing of fiber-endoscopes but also state accepted methods of regular microbial sampling. Although major instruments like endoscopes are covered by these recommendations, other devices used as optional add-ons for endoscopes are not included. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the potential for endowashers to act as a possible source of infection. METHOD: 24 endowashers were sampled. Sterile rinse-water was pumped through the endowasher and tested microbiologically according to standardised tests. Sampling was performed in 18 hospitals, including 2 university teaching hospitals, in northern Germany. If endowashers were contaminated, devices were reprocessed and re-tested. RESULTS: Of 44 samples, 6 (14%) were contaminated with pathogens of up to >20,000 cfu/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative non-fermenters such as Stenotrophomonas spp. (18x) and Acinetobacter spp. (2x), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (1x), Enterobacter cloacae (1x), Candida albicans (1x), Serratia spp. (1x), Streptococcus spp. (1x) and others (2x). CONCLUSION: Endowashers can be a potential source of infection. Despite their common use, they are not routinely sampled microbiologically. Endowashers should be clearly mentioned in respective guidelines and routine quality control sampling of endowashers should be part of such recommendations. If endowashers are not monitored regularly, devices with single-use hoses should be used.
TI  - Effects of silver-based wound dressings on the bacterial flora in chronic leg ulcers and its susceptibility in vitro to silver.
AB  - Silver-based dressings have been used extensively in wound management in recent years, but data on their antimicrobial activity in the clinical setting are limited. In order to explore their effects on chronic leg ulcer flora, 14 ulcers were cultured after at least 3 weeks treatment with Aquacel Ag((R)) or Acticoat((R)). Phenotypic and genetic silver resistance were investigated in a total of 56 isolates. Silver-based dressings had a limited effect on primary wound pathogens, which were present in 79% of the cultures before, and 71% after, treatment. One silver-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain was identified (silver nitrate minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 512 mg/l, positive for silE, silS and silP). Further studies in vitro showed that inducible silver-resistance was more frequent in Enterobacteriaceae with cephalosporin-resistance and that silver nitrate had mainly a bacteriostatic effect on Staphylococcus aureus. Monitoring of silver resistance should be considered in areas where silver is used extensively.
TI  - Polymicrobial abdominal wall necrotizing fasciitis after cesarean section.
AB  - We report a case of a previously healthy woman after an uneventful caesarean section who developed polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. She was given a non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drug (NSAID) after her delivery. Her post-delivery course was complicated by septic shock, and required multiple debridements before abdominal reconstruction. This case describes the increased risk of necrotizing fasciitis with NSAID use. Unusual were the organisms causing the polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter agglomerans, Acinetobacter baumannii, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. METHODS: We performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of NAC. We also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with NAC or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and FITC-labeled concanavalin A. We measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and C. krusei. RESULTS: NAC 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9% reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of NAC ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. Biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in NAC-treated biofilms for all organisms except VRE. The number of non-viable cells in NAC-treated Gram-positive biofilms was increased (p<0.05 for MRSA and VRE). NAC-treated Gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. Fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. NAC has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against Escherichia coli. Herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (FQs). We have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these FQs. In contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. Our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Heracleum thomsonii (Clarke) from the cold desert of the western Himalayas.
AB  - Volatile oil composition of hydro-distilled (HD) and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO(2)) essential oil of freshly collected aerial parts of Heracleum thomsonii (Umbeliferae) from the western Himalayas was studied by GC-FID and GC-MS. Results revealed qualitative and quantitative dissimilarity in the composition of hydro-distilled and SC-CO(2) extracted oils. Nineteen constituents, which accounted for 89.32% of total constituents in HD oil, represented by limonene (4.31%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (3.69%), terpinolene (22.24%), neryl acetate (36.19%), nerol (9.51%) and p-cymene-8-ol (2.61%) were identified. In SC-CO(2) extracted oil, 24 constituents representing 89.95% of total constituents were identified. Terpinolene (5.08%), germacrene D (2.17%), neryl acetate (51.62%), nerol (9.78%), geranyl acetate (2.06%), alpha-bisabolol (2.48%) and 1-nonadecanol (4.96%) were the dominating constituents. In vitro antimicrobial activity of hydro-distilled oil was conducted against microrobial strains including two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and five Gram-negative (Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebseilla pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria as well as seven fungi (Candida albicans, Issatchenkia orientalis, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus sydowii and Trichophyton rubrum) using broth microdilution method. The results of bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity against fungi C. albicans (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)), A. parasiticus (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)), A. sydowii (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)), T. rubrum (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)), Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)) and Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory amino acid derivatives from the ascidian Herdmania momus.
AB  - Four new amino acid derivatives, herdmanines A-D (1-4), were isolated from the marine ascidian Herdmania momus. Herdmanines A-C contain the unusual D-form of arginine. Compounds 3 and 4 had a moderate suppressive effect on the production of NO, with IC(5)(0) values of 96 and 9 muM, respectively. These compounds were found to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS. The inhibitory activities on the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were evaluated.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: SLP is employed by Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the USA and Europe during 2008-09. METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being </=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. extracts and essential oil.
AB  - Leaves of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. are used in traditional Thai and Chinese  medicine for the treatment of septic wounds and other infections. In this study, the essential oil, hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of these leaves were evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities using the disc diffusion assay and agar microdilution method. The essential oil was the most potent, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 microg mL(-)(1) against Bacillus cereus and an MIC of 1.2 mg mL(-)(1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Activity was also detected from the hexane extract against Enterobacter cloacae and S. aureus. Minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations were typically equal to or two-fold higher than the MICs for both extracts, indicating microbicidal activity. The present data show that B. balsamifera extracts have activity against various infectious and toxin-producing microorganisms. This plant's active constituents could potentially be developed for use in the treatment and/or prevention of microbial disease.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  - Wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. It is therefore imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at West Virginia University Hospital. Standardised corrected zones of inhibition (CZOIs) were performed on all clinical isolates. It was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. In particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and yeasts with CZOI of 3-11.5 mm. All meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a CZOI range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. Sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. CZOIs of 4.25 mm were calculated for Enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. The bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and Candida albicans. No antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by Kirby Bauer Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute classification system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. When a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. Overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. This finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. Consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae oral isolates from Brazilian HIV-positive patients. Correlation with CD4 cell counts and viral load.
AB  - The aim was to evaluate the presence of Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae in the oral cavities of HIV-positive patients. Forty-five individuals diagnosed as HIV-positive by ELISA and Western-blot, and under anti-retroviral therapy for at least 1 year, were included in the study. The control group constituted 45 systemically healthy individuals matched to the HIV patients to gender, age and oral conditions. Oral rinses were collected and isolates were identified by API system. Counts of microorganisms from HIV and control groups were compared statistically by a Mann-Whitney test (alpha=5%). The percentages of individuals positive for staphylococci were similar between the groups (p=0.764), whereas for Gram-negative rods, a higher percentage was observed amongst HIV-positive (p=0.001). There was no difference in Staphylococcus counts between HIV and control groups (p=0.1008). Counts were lower in the oral cavities of patients with low viral load (p=0.021), and no difference was observed in relation to CD4 counts (p=0.929). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species in HIV group, and Staphylococcus epidermidis was the prevalent species in the control group. Significantly higher numbers of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were detected in the oral cavities of the HIV group than in the control (p=0.0001). Enterobacter cloacae was the most frequently isolated species in both groups. Counts of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were significantly lower in patients with low CD4 counts (p=0.011); however, there was no difference relating to viral load. It may be concluded that HIV group showed greater species diversity and a higher prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae/Pseudomonadaceae.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - The prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. Since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ETT) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of VAP, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs with that of silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. The ETTs were tested for their ability to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ETT but not on the gardine-coated ETT. The gardine and gendine ETTs completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver ETTs (p < 0.001). The gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs were more durable against MRSA than either the silver-coated or uncoated ETTs for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). We have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs are superior to silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. Future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs can significantly reduce the risk of VAP.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Knowledge regarding pathogens, primary sources of infection and antibiotic resistance in the NICU is essential for developing management strategies. This study aimed to analyze the long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a tertiary referral center in southern Taiwan. METHODS: Infants < 30 days old, with positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine or tissue fluid cultures during hospitalization in the NICU of National Cheng Kung University Hospital from July 1989 to June 2008 were included in the study. RESULTS: In total, 1,417 organisms and episodes were identified during the study period. Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms and fungi constituted 923 (65.1%), 358 (25.3%) and 136 (9.6%) of the pathogens, respectively. Of the Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (51.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (34.8%) and Enterococcus spp. (6.1%) were the major pathogens; and 27% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For the Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%), Escherichia coli (16.7%) and Enterobacter cloacae (16.7%) were dominant. Also, Candida albicans accounted for 50% of fungal infections. The most common source of infection was bloodstream infection (59.0%), and 5.6% of these were catheter-related. Skin and soft tissue infections were also frequent (26.3%). CONCLUSION: Bloodstream and skin/soft tissue infections caused by commensal species play an important role in healthcare-associated infections in the NICU. New measures should be developed in response to the changing patterns in the NICU.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  - Maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. This study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for Staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for Streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for Enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for Enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. A range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. The results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on S. aureus. Minimal concentrations and MBC of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. The MBC of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against S. aureus were also decreased. The other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. Excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. The synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.
TI  - [One stage debridement and closed-suction drainage for treatment of infection after lumbar instrumentation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of one stage debridement and closed-suction drainage for treatment of infection after lumbar instrumentation. METHODS: Between June 2002 and March 2008, 12 patients with infection after lumbar instrumentation were treated with one stage debridement and closed-suction drainage, including 9 males and 3 females and aging 35-68 years (48.5 years on average). The disease duration varied from 7 days to 183 days (56 days on average). The segments of internal fixation included 7 cases single segment at levels of L4,5, 4 cases of double segments at levels of L4,5, L5, S1 (2 cases), and L3,4, L4,5 (2 cases), and 1 case of three segments at levels of L(3,4), L(4,5), L5, S1. Two patients were treated with internal fixator removal. RESULTS: The bacterial culture results of intervertebral discs were positive in 8 cases for Staphylococcus aureus and in 3 cases for Enterobacter cloacae, negative in 1 case. Primary healing of incisions were achieved in all cases. Twelve patients were followed up 18-53 months (34.7 months on average). The white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein significantly decreased after operation, showing significant differences at 15 days after operation when compared with those before operation (P < 0.05). No obvious low back pain was observed. Pathological-changed vertebra-space fused. No displacement and breakage of internal fixator occurred; in 2 patients who were given internal fixator removal, no removal of the instrumentation was performed again. The X-ray films showed that the average kyphosis decreased 0.8 degrees at 18 months after operation. At last follow-up, the visual analogue scale score was 2 +/- 1, showing significant difference (P < 0.05) when compared with that (10 +/- 2) before operation. CONCLUSION: One stage debridement and closed-suction drainage therapy is an effective method for treating infection after lumbar instrumentation. The operation is easy and can reduce hospitalization days.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between April 2008 and March 2009].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2008 to March 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. thetaiotaomicron, B. wadsworthia and B. ovatus, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp., nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of the DiversiLab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  - Many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. DiversiLab (DL; bioMerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. In this study, we evaluated the DL system for the identification of hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. Appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with DL. DL typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for Acinetobacter (n = 26) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. With two exceptions, DL typing of Klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with PFGE, and in addition, PFGE-nontypeable (PFGE-NT) isolates could be typed. Enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated with PFGE results; also, PFGE-NT isolates could be clustered. In a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by PFGE. The results for Escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. When multiple Pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in DL, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. Isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including PFGE, spa typing, and MLVA, were grouped together in a number of cases. For Enterococcus faecium, the limited variability of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with MLVA and esp gene typing was poor. All of the results are reflected in Simpson's index of diversity and adjusted Rand's and Wallace's coefficients. DL is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of Acinetobacter spp., S. maltophilia, the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Klebsiella spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, E. coli. In our study, DL was inadequate for P. aeruginosa, E. faecium, and MRSA. However, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing results.
TI  - [A drug addict presenting with complicated tricuspid valve endocarditis].
AB  - The right-sided heart valves are affected in about 10% of patients with infective endocarditis. However, the tricuspid valve is the most frequently involved valve in intravenous drug users with infective endocarditis. When treated with antibiotics, the prognosis is considered favorable. Reported here is the case of a drug-addicted patient with polymicrobial (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve and a lethal outcome due to multiple organ failure. The indications and options to perform cardiac surgery in patients with infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. In experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees C and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. From the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Staphylococcus aureus species. These 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. All contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. In samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. In experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C. Semen with E. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. This reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). In conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. Bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health care settings other than hospitals. METHODS: We conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. Of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. Among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). Most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. Crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. Increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of bloodstream infections due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. Most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. In-hospital case-fatality ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. Several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are common chemical agents that have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activity. AIMS: To detect any potential antibacterial effects of ibuprofen and acetaminophen on pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were tested for antibacterial activity against seven isolates of bacteria including gram positive bacteria (Staphylococci aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and gram negative bacteria (E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi and Paracoccus yeei). Spectrophotometer assay was applied to determine the antibacterial activities of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Three controls were included in this study: Ampicilline sodium (20 mug/ml); cefotaxime sodium (20 mug/ml) and chemical free medium. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Paracoccus yeei were susceptible to lower concentrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (MIC=1.25 mg/ml), while two strains of Enterobacter exhibited resistance to these agents. CONCLUSIONS: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen showed a potential antibacterial effect on isolated strains of bacteria. They had the same ability to inhibit bacterial growth.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of tualang honey and its effect in burn wound management: a comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of honey as a natural product of Apis spp. for burn treatment has been widely applied for centuries. Tualang honey has been reported to have antibacterial properties against various microorganisms, including those from burn-related diagnoses, and is cheaper and easier to be absorbed by Aquacel dressing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential antibacterial properties of tualang honey dressing and to determine its effectiveness as a partial thickness burn wound dressing. METHODS: In order to quantitate the bioburden of the swabs, pour plates were performed to obtain the colony count (CFU/ml). Swabs obtained from burn wounds were streaked on blood agar and MacConkey agar for bacterial isolation and identification. Later, antibacterial activity of Aquacel-tualang honey, Aquacel-Manuka honey, Aquacel-Ag and Aquacel- plain dressings against bacteria isolated from patients were tested (in-vitro) to see the effectiveness of those dressings by zone of inhibition assays. RESULTS: Seven organisms were isolated. Four types of Gram-negative bacteria, namely Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., and three Gram-positive bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (CONS) and Streptococcus spp., were isolated. Total bacterial count decreased on day 6 and onwards. In the in-vitro antibacterial study, Aquacel-Ag and Aquacel-Manuka honey dressings gave better zone of inhibition for Gram positive bacteria compared to Aquacel-Tualang honey dressing. However, comparable results were obtained against Gram negative bacteria tested with Aquacel-Manuka honey and Aquacel-Tualang honey dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Tualang honey has a bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic effect. It is useful as a dressing, as it is easier to apply and is less sticky compared to Manuka honey. However, for Gram positive bacteria, tualang honey is not as effective as usual care products such as silver-based dressing or medical grade honey dressing.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2008].
AB  - We examined the antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against main bacteria isolated from patient blood in Keio university hospital between January and November in 2008. A total of 187 isolates, including 43 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 50 Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested. Meropenem showed the potent and stable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially compared with our previous testing data. These results suggested that meropenem was first-line antibiotic for serious infections, although over 12 years passed after meropenem was approved in Japan.
TI  - In vitro studies of a novel antimicrobial luer-activated needleless connector for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report in vitro studies of a commercially available novel antimicrobial Luer-activated connector with the inner surface coated with nanoparticle-silver to prevent contaminants from forming biofilm and causing catheter-related bloodstream infection. METHODS: Sterile control nonmedicated connectors and antimicrobial connectors were filled with approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/mL of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans; after 24 h of incubation, the numbers of remaining viable microorganisms were quantified and compared with the concentration in control connectors ( approximately 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL). In trials simulating clinical use, septal membranes of connectors were inoculated with E. cloacae, were allowed to dry, and were then actuated and infused with lactated ringer's solution for 72 h, with sampling for microorganisms in downstream efferent fluid and for biofilm in the connector. RESULTS: Microorganisms suspended in the intraluminal fluid path of antimicrobial connectors were rapidly killed. For 5 species, there was a 5.23-6.80 mean log(10) reduction (>99.999%), and with C. albicans, there was a 99.9% reduction. In clinical simulation trials, heavy contamination of downstream fluid was detected at all time points with control connectors, reaching approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/mL at 72 h, and heavy biofilm was uniformly present; with the antimicrobial connectors, there was complete prevention of downstream fluid contamination and total absence of biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: These simulation experiments show that needleless connectors readily acquire an internal biofilm when microorganisms gain access to the internal fluid path and that biofilm formation allows an exponential buildup of internal contamination, with shedding back into the fluid path and downstream sufficient to cause bacteremia. Incorporation of nanoparticle silver into the lining surfaces of the novel connector kills microorganisms in the fluid pathway and prevents internal biofilm formation, even with high levels of introduced contamination and continuous fluid flow. This technology deserves to be evaluated in a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine its capacity to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infection.
TI  - Tipsitis: incidence and outcome-a single centre experience.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) called 'Tipsitis' has been reported but appears unusual. We report here our experience of patients who were diagnosed to have Tipsitis at our centre. METHODS: Retrospective single centre study. Patients identified from a dedicated data base. Patients with TIPSS with otherwise unexplained sustained bacteraemia were included. RESULTS: Over 14 years of age, of 785 patients with TIPSS, eight (1%) had Tipsitis. Indication for TIPSS: variceal bleed, seven; refractory ascites, one. Child-Pugh score: 8.3 (1.4). Seven patients had overlapping stents in situ. Duration to Tipsitis: 21.6 (7.1) months. At diagnosis, TIPSS was occluded in four and patent in three. Tipsitis developed within 2 weeks of shunt interventions in two patients and was owing to development of bilio-venous fistula in one. The organisms identified were: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcusfaecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Median duration of antibiotic therapy: 3 (0.3-3) months. Symptoms initially resolved in all but one. Symptoms recurred in three and this was related to premature cessation of antibiotics in two. Five patients died at a median 1.3 (0.3 to 33) months after Tipsitis with Tipsitis contributing to death in three. CONCLUSION: Tipsitis is a rare but serious problem. It should be suspected in patients with TIPSS and unexplained sustained bacteraemia. Shunt interventions, where TIPSS is inserted for variceal bleed, and use of overlapping shunts at TIPSS insertion may be risk factors for its development. Prolonged antibiotics are usually required but Tipsitis may recur despite apparently successful treatment.
TI  - [In vitro activities of Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin against 5 pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin against 5 pathogenic bacteria, include 2 wild strains and 7 resistant strains. METHODS: Broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test was used for bacteria that growed aerobically. RESULTS: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides were basically in vitro efficient agents for inhibition against to methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCN, 85460), wild Staphylococcus aureus (24157), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, 84688 and 91452), class I beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC, 85439 and 93543), wild Escherichia coli (84492), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases Escherichia coli (ESBL, 84492), inhabitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (IRT, 85580). CONCLUSION: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity; especially have in vitro activity to resistant strains. So it is hopeful to be developed as the antimicrobial agent as well as the disinfectant and the antiseptic.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. Maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. Therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We studied biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. We compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. Maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. METHODS: Comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. The formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. The optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. Maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. RESULTS: The strongest biofilms were formed by S. aureus and S. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. The highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. The presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. A maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.
TI  - Novel depsides as potential anti-inflammatory agents with potent inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
AB  - Sixteen novel depsides were synthesized for the first time. Their chemical structures were clearly determined by (1)H NMR, ESI mass spectra, and elemental analyses. All the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790) and three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 13525, and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047) by the MTT method. Compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 5-bromonicotinate (5) exhibited significant antibacterial activities against E. coli ATCC 35218 with an MIC of 0.78 microg/mL, which was superior to the positive control kanamycin B. In addition, compound 5 showed potent inhibitory activity against E. coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and pharmacological investigation of iodined salicylimines, new prototypes of antimicrobial drug candidates.
AB  - A series of 3,5-diiodo-salicylalidene Schiff bases (compounds 1-35) has been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. The compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities by the MTT method. Some of the compounds inhibit the growth of a broad range of bacteria including the species of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Among them, compounds 2-[(4-chloro-phenylimino)methyl]-4,6-diiodo-phenol 11 and 2,4-diiodo-6-[(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylimino)methyl]phenol 19 showed the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC of 3.1, 12.9, 3.3, 6.5, 12.9, 3.3 and 3.2, 12.8, 3.2, 12.8, 12.8, 3.2 muM against B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, E. Coli, and E. cloacae, respectively.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - [Microbiologic study on the pathogens isolated from wound culture among orthopaedic patients after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the bacterial characteristic of orthopedic open wounds injured in Wenchuan earthquake and their drug-resistant pattern for reasonable application of antibiotics. METHODS: A total of 340 secretion specimens isolated from 148 cases of orthopedic open wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. Among the patients, 71 patients were male and 77 patients were female, ranging in age from 2 to 82 years, with an average of 40.4 years. Thirty-seven patients were detained under the ground ranged from 5 min to 102 h. The 340 specimens of exudation in the wound were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: The infection rate of 148 cases was 66.2 percent. Two hundred and fifty-seven pathogens were isolated from 340 secretion specimen, including gram-negative bacteria accounted for 77.8%, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 20.6%. The most frequent pathogens isolated from secretion culture in Wenchuan earthquake survivors were Escherichia coli (16.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.6%). CONCLUSION: The drug sensitivity test of exudation as well as exact application of antibiotics should be highly payed attention to by doctors in order to reduce the occurrence of bacterial resistance.
TI  - Microbiological study of pathogenic bacteria isolated from paediatric wound infections following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - On 12 May 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake struck in Sichuan, China. Within 1 month  after the earthquake, 98 injured children were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. According to clinical manifestations, 50 children were diagnosed with wound infections. Wound secretions were cultured for bacteria. Pathogen distribution and drug resistance were analyzed. A total of 99 pathogens were isolated; 16 (16%) were Gram-positive bacteria and 81 (82%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The distribution of pathogens isolated within 1 month after the earthquake was different to the distribution of pathogens in 546 general hospitalized cases in the y before the earthquake. The pathogens most frequently isolated 1 month after the earthquake were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%). The pathogens most frequently isolated in the y prior to the earthquake were Escherichia coli (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%). The rate of isolated drug-resistant bacteria was higher in the earthquake cases than in the general hospitalized cases. In the cases injured in the earthquake, the rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were higher than in the cases from before the earthquake. Multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant A. baumannii were isolated at a higher rate in cases after the earthquake than in those before the earthquake. These changes in the spectrum of pathogens and in the drug resistance of the pathogens isolated following an earthquake will provide the basis for emergency treatment after earthquakes.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis is a rare side effect. It has only been described in 10 case reports since 1989. However, recently we were confronted with two cases within 1 month. In one patient the vasculitis resolved after termination of the ciprofloxacin therapy; in the other patient the ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis was superimposed on a severe forefoot infection, leading to progressive gangrene and a below-knee amputation. Ciprofloxacin is among the standard treatments for infected ischemic ulcers; in the rare case of ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis, it might be interpreted as progression of infection, instead of a complication of the treatment, thus leading to faulty diagnosis and treatment. The intention of this case report is to raise awareness for anyone prescribing ciprofloxacin as treatment for infected diabetic and ischemic ulcers.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis. A rare cause of adult airway stenosis.
AB  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis is a rare cause of airway stenosis in adults. This report describes a 73-year-old woman with a recent history of polysialadenitis, who presented with severe airway obstruction due to infection and stenosis of tracheal and bronchial tissue. Tissue culture of the bronchial mucosa showed growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Sputum culture showed growth of MRSE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis; the same organisms were cultured from the salivary glands. Tracheostomy and antibiotic therapy were effective in controlling the disease.
TI  - [Is pneumatic sample transport system also a carrier for microorganisms?].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible infection and contamination risk of the pneumatic system used in our hospital and to establish essential infection control measures. The study was conducted in a quaternary health care center with 1.000 bed capacity. A total of 614 specimens were taken 2 times weekly from the pneumatic transport system and its carriers at 22 wards, 5 intensive care units, 3 laboratories, 2 blood taking units, and pharmacy. Samples were also obtained from the fingertips of 33 subjects using the system, before and after contact with the carriers. A questionnaire that consisted of 8 questions was applied to 224 subjects who worked in those units, evaluating the degree of compliance to the obligations for the cleaning of the pneumatic system and carriers and their approach in case of visible pollution at the system. Bacterial growth was observed in 15.2% (45/296) of samples in the 1st week and 7.6% (18/238) of the samples in the 2nd week, making a total of 11.8% (63/534) bacterial growth. No growth was detected from the areas where the carriers were placed. Of these 69.8% were coagulase negative staphylococci, 11.1% diphteroids, 7.9% Acinetobacter Iwoffii, 4.8% Staphylococcus aureus, 4.8% Bacillus spp. and 1.6% Enterococcus durans. Acinetobacter baumannii and Aspergillus were detected at two fingertip samples taken before the contact with carriers, while again A. baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae were detected at the samples following contact. Moreover, 31.3% of the subjects noted that they cleaned the carriers only if any visible contamination was present. In addition, 14.3% reported that they have encountered broken or spilled up material in the system for more than 5 times, 10.3% reported that they followed the instructions in case of presence of infected material inside the carriers, 23.7% reported that they always washed their hands after any contact with the carriers, 9.8% noted that they always used gloves during contact with the system. Of the subjects 73.7% declared that they had no information about cleaning and decontamination procedures related to the system. These data revealed that the pneumatic system used in our hospital carried contamination risk and the rules for hygiene and disinfection regarding the pneumatic transport system has to be determined, implemented and checked in order to establish appropriate infection control measures.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - [Influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Rhodotorula rubra isolated by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. In order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. Nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria for obtaining the control samples. Formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. RESULTS: Performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. Changes of these characteristics was observed both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open perspective for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.
TI  - Crude extracts of, and purified compounds from, Pterocarpus angolensis, and the essential oil of Lippia javanica: their in-vitro cytotoxicities and activities against selected bacteria and Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - In a recent study, various extracts of Pterocarpus angolensis were prepared and tested against bacteria. The acetone extract was found to be the most active against all the bacteria investigated, with minimum inhibitory concentrations varying from 0.0156 mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus to 2 mg/ml against Enterobacter cloacae. Seven pure compounds were subsequently isolated from the ethanol extract of P. angolensis. Using several chromatographic and spectroscopic methods, the structures of five of these compounds - phthalate and four derivatives of epicatechin [(-)-epicatechin, epicatechin-3-O-galate, epicatechin (4beta-8)-epicatechin (B2), and a hexamer of epicatechin] - were successfully determined. The seven purified compounds were then further tested, in vitro, against Staphylococcus aureus and Entamoeba histolytica, and for their in-vitro cytotoxic activity. Although all seven were active against S. aureus, just one of the purified compounds from P. angolensis and piperitenone, a pure compound isolated from Lippia javanica essential oil, were found to have marked activity against Entamoeba histolytica, with median inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 25 and 100 microg/ml, respectively. The other P. angolensis compounds were either weakly active or showed no activity against the amoebae when tested at concentrations up to 400 microg/ml. All seven compounds isolated from P. angolensis showed less toxicity against cultures of human (HCT-8) cells than piperitenone, with IC(50) of 175-375 microg/ml. The presence of epichatechin and derivatives (with strong antibacterial activities but generally weak activities against Entamoeba histolytica) in the stem bark of P. angolensis has thus been demonstrated. Further investigation of the activities of these compounds and their potential use in the treatment of bacterial diseases appears justified.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from infected wounds of children after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogenic bacteria isolated from pediatric cases suffering from wounds infection following the Wenchuan earthquake. METHODS: Of the ninety-eight injured children, 50 had wound infection diagnosed by clinical examination. Specimens for culture were collected from the fifty injured children and the results of bacterial identification and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In the fifty injured children with wound infection, microbial growth was detected in 31 (62.0%) and 21 children suffered from mixed infections (the infection rate was 67.7%). Ninety-nine pathogens were isolated, gram positive bacteria accounted for 16.16% (16 strains), Gram negative bacteria accounted for 81.82% (81 strains), and fungus 2.02% (2 strains). Staphylococcus aureus (5 strains, 5.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (3 strains, 3.03%) and Enterococcus faecium (2 strains, 2.02%) were the primary Gram-positive bacteria identified and Gram-negative infections typically included Acinetobacter baumanii (27 strains, 27.27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18 strains, 18.18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 strains, 13.13%). Acinetobacter baumanii was the most common organism isolated from wounds. Duration of being szeged and complications had a significant association with wound infection with Acinetobacter baumanii. Drug sensitivity tests displayed that the isolated bacteria were highly resistant to common antibiotics. One strain of Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex and six strains of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to all common antibiotics including imipenem/cilastatin. Vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria were not identified. CONCLUSION: Following the Wenchuan earthquake disaster, wound infection profiles of pediatric patients were significantly different, Acinetobacter baumanii was the main common organism isolated from wounds in contrast to the previous low isolation rate. The isolated bacteria were highly and multiple drug resistant and it was difficult to treat. Knowing the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogen is of paramount importance in guiding the clinical treatment.
TI  - Crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  - The problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. These organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the pH of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. In this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary pH above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus aureus elevated the pH of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the pH of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. The most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. This strategy raises the nucleation pH (pH(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. Increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a pH(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. It is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. Clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. The portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. After a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. Within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus oralis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The source of the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew C. perfringens, Hafnia alvei, and Enterobacter cloacae. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Clostridium perfringens-associated liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.
TI  - Identification of novel antibacterial peptides by chemoinformatics and machine learning.
AB  - The rise of antibiotic resistant pathogens is one of the most pressing global health issues. Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. The best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of coumarins from the roots of Ferulago  campestris (Apiaceae).
AB  - We report the isolation of several coumarins and the stereochemical assessment of some pyranocoumarins, as well as the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the three most abundant ones (grandivittin, agasyllin and aegelinol benzoate) isolated from the roots of Ferulago campestris collected in Sicily and of the hydrolysis product (aegelinol). Aegelinol and agasyllin showed antibacterial activity against nine ATCC and the same clinically isolated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. At a concentration between 16 and 125 mg/mL both coumarins showed a significant antibacterial effect against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In particular the ATCC strains Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella thypii, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter earogenes (MIC = 16 and 32 mg/mL for aegelinol and agasyllin, respectively) were the most inhibited. Antibacterial activity was also found against Helicobacter pylori: a dose-dependent inhibition was shown between 5 and 25 mg/mL. The antioxidant activity of the coumarins was evaluated by their effects on human whole blood leukocytes (WB) and on isolated polymorphonucleate (PMN) chemiluminescence (CL), PMA-stimulated and resting.
TI  - Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis in the years 2005-2007 among patients of  the Peritoneal Dialysis Clinic of the Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis (PDRP) is the most common complication of dialysis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. OBJECTIVES: The study analyzes incidence of PDRP, pathogens responsible for the disease and response to treatment in patients at the Peritoneal Dialysis Clinic of the Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine of Pomeranian Medical University and the Independent Public University Hospital No 2 in Szczecin in the years 2005-2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 36 months, 20 peritonitis incidents have been diagnosed in 18 subjects of 89 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. RESULTS: The incidence of PDRP was 1 episode/32 patient-months with 45% of PDRP episodes caused by Gram-positive bacteria, 40% by Gram-negative bacteria, and 5% by fungi. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen among Gram-positive bacteria and so were equally Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae among Gram-negative bacteria. A satisfactory percentage of successful standard therapy (80%) was achieved; in 20% of PDRP cases removal of the Tenckhoff catheter was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of PDRP caused by Gram-negative bacteria has been observed as compared to the data from other centers. There was high susceptibility of the isolated strains to third-generation cephalosporins and chinolones. Low incidence of PDRP in the center and bacteriological profile of strains causing the disease confirm high qualifications and training quality of the patients and the correct insertion of dialysis catheters.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - Generation of antibacterial oligosaccharides derived from chitin using heterologous endochitinase synthesized in Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize two heterologous endochitinases in Escherichia coli and demonstrate their potential for applied use in generating antibacterial chitin-derived oligosaccharides (OGS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterologous endochitinase genes, chiA Nima and chiA74, were expressed in E. coli. Endochitinases were secreted by the E. coli export machinery and by approximately 20 h maximal chitinolytic activity was observed. The highest chitinolytic activity was observed with ChiA Nima, which produced antibacterial OGS with activities against Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and S. xylosus. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that the export machinery of E. coli is well suited for the secretion of bioactive ChiA74 and ChiA Nima endochitinases, and that the latter can generate antibacterial OGS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study suggests that it is feasible to synthesize endochitinases ChiA Nima and ChiA74 codified by E. coli and mass-produce these enzymes in culture supernatants. As signal peptides in native ChiA Nima and ChiA74 were recognized by the protein export molecular apparatus in E. coli, these short peptides could be included as signal sequences for transport in E. coli of other proteins with applied value. This is the first report suggesting that ChiA Nima can be used to produce OGS to control food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Pediatric infective endocarditis: Has Staphylococcus aureus overtaken viridans group streptococci as the predominant etiological agent?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viridans group streptococci (VGS) have traditionally been the most common etiological agents of infective endocarditis (IE). Advances in cardiovascular surgery and the increasing use of long-term central venous catheters may have altered the epidemiology of pediatric IE. METHODS: A chart review of children younger than 17 years of age with IE was completed at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta) between 1985 and 2004. The literature was reviewed to look for changes over time in the most common etiological agents of pediatric IE. RESULTS: There were 31 cases of definite IE and nine cases of possible IE at the Stollery Children's Hospital, 19 of which were nosocomial. Thirty cases (75%) had congenital heart disease. The etiological agents were Staphylocccus aureus (n=16), VGS (n=5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=3), enterococcus (n=3), other streptococci (n=8), Enterobacter cloacae (n=1) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=1), while three cases were culture negative. Two deaths were due to S aureus IE. Review of the literature identified an increasing number of case series in which S aureus was the predominant etiological agent, but VGS still predominated in some recent series. CONCLUSION: Congenital heart disease remains the primary risk factor for pediatric IE. Prospective population-based studies are required to determine whether S aureus has become the predominant pathogen.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Biologically active and C-amidated hinnavinII-38-Asn produced from a Trx fusion construct in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cabbage butterfly (Artogeia rapae) antimicrobial peptide hinnavinII as a member of cecropin family is synthesized as 37 residues in size with an amidated lysine at C-terminus and shows the humoral immune response to a bacterial invasion. In this work, a synthetic gene for hinnavinII-38-Asn (HIN) with an additional amino acid asparagine residue containing amide group at C-terminus was cloned into pET-32a(+) vector to allow expression of HIN as a Trx fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The resulting expression level of the fusion protein Trx-HIN could reach 15-20% of the total cell proteins and more than 70% of the target proteins were in soluble form. The fusion protein could be purified successfully by HiTrap Chelating HP column and a high yield of 15 mg purified fusion protein was obtained from 80 ml E. coli culture. Recombinant HIN was readily obtained by enterokinase cleavage of the fusion protein followed by FPLC chromatography, and 3.18 mg pure active recombinant HIN was obtained from 80 ml culture. The molecular mass of recombinant HIN determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is 4252.084 Da which matches the theoretical mass (4252.0 Da) of HIN. Comparing the antimicrobial activities of the recombinant hinnavinII with C-amidated terminus to that without an amidated C-terminus, we found that the amide of asparagine at C-terminus of hinnavinII improved its potency on certain microorganism such as E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus megaterium, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Etiology of neonatal blood stream infections in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal blood stream infections (BSI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. It is crucial to continuously monitor the local epidemiology of neonatal BSI to detect any changes in patterns of infection and susceptibility to various antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: To examine the etiology of BSI in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Republic of Georgia, a resource-poor country, and to determine antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated organisms. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of all septic infants was conducted in the NICUs of two pediatric hospitals in Tbilisi between September 2003 and September 2004. RESULTS: A total of 200 infants with clinical signs of sepsis were admitted to two NICUs. Of these, 126 (63%) had confirmed bacteremia. The mortality rate was 34%. A total of 98 (78%) of 126 recovered isolates were Gram-negative organisms and 28 (22%) were Gram-positive. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen, accounting for 36 (29%) of 126 isolates, followed by Enterobacter cloacae accounting for 19 (15%) and Staphylococcus aureus accounting for 15 (12%). The Gram-negative organisms showed a high degree of resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, and comparatively low resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, carbapenems, and gentamicin; 40% of S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). In multivariate analysis only umbilical discharge was a significant risk factor for having a positive blood culture at admission to NICU (prevalence ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.82-2.77). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal BSI was mainly caused by Gram-negative organisms, which are developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Understanding the local epidemiology of neonatal BSI can lead to the development of better medical practices, especially more appropriate choices for empiric antibiotic therapy, and may contribute to improvement of infection control practices.
TI  - Summer Peaks in the Incidences of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection Among Hospitalized Patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. There are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. We quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. METHODS: A cohort of all adult patients admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center during the period from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. Time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. RESULTS: There were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; P ! .01), E. cloacae (46%; P ! .01), E. coli (12%; P ! .01), and A. baumannii (21%; Pp.06). For each 10 degrees F increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (Pp.01) and A. baumanii (Pp.05). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. For some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. These findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. Future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2006 and March 2007].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2006 to March 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while Enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. There were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
AB  - Mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. The antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal defense have not been defined. We found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein A-I. The predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. Normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. Removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. Furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide HNP-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against P. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. The emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.
TI  - [Infectious complications of surgically treatment pelvic fractures].
AB  - Based on case histories, the authors draw attention to important infectious complications in patients surgically treated for pelvic injuries. These complications were recorded in four out of 75 patients (5.3%) undergoing surgery for pelvic fracture in the period from 2001 to 2005. The chief risk factors for the development of infection included the poor state of health of a polytraumatized patient in combination with a long stay in an acute care unit, and severe trauma and bleeding of soft tissue structures in B and C types of pelvic injury. Bacteriological findings showed the presence of several pathogenic species (Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca) or multi-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).
TI  - Susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in Germany.
AB  - Tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. Here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a European country prior to its clinical use. A total of 2,610 Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the microdilution method. All enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MRSA), and streptococci tested were tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the Escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible, while about 10% of the Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. Based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - A prospective study of the incidence and characteristics of septic arthritis in a teaching hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - To find the incidence, characteristics, method of treatment, and outcome of synovial fluid culture-positive septic arthritis, all newly admitted cases of synovial fluid culture-positive septic arthritis to King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were studied prospectively during August 2005 to July 2006 and only those with positive synovial fluid culture septic arthritis were included in the analysis. Demographic, clinical, hematological, biochemical, microbiological, radiological, and histopathological data along with the interventional and surgical procedures and the functional outcome related to the joint involved were recorded. Of the 42 patients admitted, only 12 fulfilled the study criteria of having positive synovial fluid culture. Annual incidence was estimated to be 2.13 per 100,000 inhabitants. The mean disease duration before diagnosis and treatment was 10.42 +/- 2.9 days. The affected joints were six knees, three hips, two shoulders, and one with hip and knee involvement. Two patients had rheumatoid arthritis, two had osteoarthritis, and one had sickle cell disease. The most common infecting organism was Staphylococcus aureus, which caused eight of the infections (66.7%), one Salmonella, one Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Enterobacter cloacae, and one Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The septic arthritis in 4 (33.3%) cases followed previous orthopedic intervention. Blood cultures were positive in three patients, all with S. aureus. White blood cell count was elevated in 3 (25%) patients. All patients received intravenous antibiotic for the initial 2 weeks, the most commonly used antibiotic was flucloxacillin. There were no deaths due to septic arthritis. The functional outcome was excellent to good. Septic arthritis is less prevalent in our community, and the most frequent organism is Staphylococcus. However, special risk factors favor other organisms such as Salmonella and Enterobacter. Previous orthopedic intervention is an important risk factor. Mortality due to septic arthritis is lower than reported elsewhere.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - Urease-positive bacteria in the stomach induce a false-positive reaction in a urea breath test for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - This study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-Helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (UBT) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a UBT using film-coated [(13)C]urea tablets. The UBT was performed in 102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of H. pylori. Urease-producing bacteria other than H. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. In 4/102 patients, the UBT gave false-positive results. These false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. Five bacterial species with urease activity (Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. As there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-H. pylori bacteria and the UBT value, and all of the patients with a false-positive UBT result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the UBT were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. Thus, for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection using a UBT, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and structure-activity relationship analysis of novel depsides as potential antibacterials.
AB  - Twenty-six depsides were synthesized to screen for their antibacterial activity.  All of them were reported for the first time. Their chemical structures were clearly determined by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, ESI mass spectra and elemental analyses, coupled with one selected single-crystal structure. All the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790) and three gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 13525 and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047) by MTT method. Compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 3-nitrobenzoate (C10) and 2-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 3-nitrobenzoate (C23) showed powerful antibacterial activities against B. subtilis with MIC of 0.78 microg/mL while compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 2-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)acetate (C8) and 2-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 2-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)acetate (C21) exhibited significant antibacterial activities against E. coli with MIC of 1.562 microg/mL, which were superior to the positive controls penicillin G and kanamycin B, respectively. On the basis of the biological results, structure-activity relationships were discussed.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - [Investigation of 728 strains of infectious bacteria in burn ward and analysis of their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious strains of bacteria in our burn ward in recent 5 years, and analyze their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the wound excretions of 306 burn patients hospitalized during 2001 to 2006 for analyzing their strains and their antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: 378 strains were Grams positive bacteria, among them Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant strain. Further analysis showed that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranked the first in occurrence, followed by methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus fecalis, 338 strains were Gram negative bacteria, and among them Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant, and Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the 2nd and 3rd. Twelve strains were fungi. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics in our burn ward may be related to the beta-lactamases from acinetobacter baumannii and multiple-drug-resistance of MRSA.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the MEPM-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (IPM). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in Escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in Citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in Serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in Providencia spp. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Symptoms and signs of port-related infections in oncology patients related to the offending pathogens.
AB  - AIM: There is limited information about symptoms and signs of port-related infections linking to their offending pathogens. METHODS: Oncology patients proven to have port-related infections were retrospectively analysed. We divided them into two subgroups according to their symptoms and signs. Onset of fever and chills with or without hypotension following the port flush was classified as 'port flush form infection'. Presence of local inflammatory signs, including erythema, warmth, tenderness and pus formation and systemic infection signs, including fever, chills with or without hypotension was classified as 'local inflammatory form infection'. RESULTS: There were 29 episodes of port-related infection among 28 patients, with port flush form 22 episodes and local inflammatory form seven episodes. Of 22 episodes of port flush form infections, 20 (91%) were nosocomial glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli, with Acinetobacter baumannii (11 episodes, 50%) and Enterobacter cloacae (four episodes, 18%) the most common. Polymicrobial infections occurred in four episodes (18%). Candida infection occurred in two episodes (9%). Of seven episodes of local inflammatory form infections, six (86%) were gram-positive cocci, with Staphylococcus aureus (five episodes, 71%) the most common. The time from port implantation to its infection was 272 +/- 255 days (30-993 days) for the port flush form infections and 82 +/- 87 days (22-265 days) for the local inflammatory form infections. This difference was not significant difference (p = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: The differences between infection of patients with port flush form and local inflammatory form in incidence and offending microorganism suggest that the aetiology of infection were different.
TI  - Prevalence of silver resistance in bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and efficacy of silver-containing wound dressings.
AB  - Silver dressings are used to manage wounds at risk of infection or locally infected. This in vitro study was conducted to assess the prevalence of silver resistance genes in 112 bacterial isolates obtained from the diabetic foot ulcers of patients attending the Diabetic Foot Clinic at Tameside General Hospital, UK. Using polymerase chain reaction to screen for three silver-resistance transcriptional units--silE, silS and silP--two silver-resistant bacteria were identified; both are strains of Enterobacter cloacae, an organism rarely implicated as a primary pathogen in chronic wounds. No recognized wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus-24 isolates and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-nine isolates) were found to contain silver-resistant genes. Analysis of the efficacy of silver-containing dressings on the silver-resistant strains of Enterobacter cloacae using confocal laser microscopy showed that, despite evidence of genetic resistance to silver, all strains were killed following a maximum of 48 hours of exposure to the dressings. Results suggest that presence of silver resistance genes is rare and that genetic resistance does not necessarily translate to phenotypic resistance to silver. While silver resistance in wound care should be monitored, the threat of widespread resistance is low and silver-containing dressings remain an extremely important tool in managing wound infection.
TI  - [Relapsing infection of cranial prosthesis sustained by Enterobacter cloacae and  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - We describe the case of a young man who suffered from relapsing infections of a cranial prosthesis implanted in 1982 after a serious accident. The presence of a bacterial infection was diagnosed by microbiological assays performed on purulent drainage from the surgical wound, removed prosthetic material and bone biopsies obtained intraoperatively. The first prosthesis infection was sustained by two nosocomial pathogens, Enterobacter cloacae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); it was treated for eight weeks with parenteral antibiotic therapy, including teicoplanin and piperacillin/tazobactam, in association with surgical debridement and prosthesis removal. The following relapse, sustained by Enterobacter cloacae, was treated with a prolonged course of parenteral antibiotic therapy and prosthesis substitution. A third infection was diagnosed two months after the last cranioplasty: cultures of purulent drainage grew MRSA and Staphylococcus gallinarum. In addition to radical debridement, oral antibiotic treatment including linezolid was introduced. Antibiotic therapy was stopped after 10 weeks; at a follow-up visit performed after three years no signs or symptoms of relapse were evident. This case shows the difficulty in eradicating prosthesis infections, and demonstrates the central role of radical surgical debridement and the need of appropriate antibiotic treatment in dosing and duration.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - The use of linezolid in the treatment of infected total joint arthroplasty.
AB  - Fourteen patients with a diagnosis of infected total joint arthroplasty treated by 1 or 2-stage revision and a course of oral linezolid were reviewed. Patients were assessed according to McPherson stage, inflammatory markers, nature of surgery, use of antibiotics, pathogen isolated, and outcome at follow-up. Pathogens isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococcus, multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and mixed growth. McPherson stages were 1 IB2, 1 IA3, 1 II A2, 3IIIA2, 2 IIIB1, 3 IIIB2, 1 IIIB3, 1 IIIC2, and 1 IIIC3. All patients showed resolution of infection, with normalization of inflammatory markers after treatment. Mean length of follow-up is 32.7 months (range, 9-44 months). Comparison is drawn with previous studies highlighting the good results achievable with the use of this antibiotic. Although no substitute for adequate surgical management, it does allow oral treatment and therefore avoids the difficulties associated with long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Assessing the effect of an antimicrobial wound dressing on biofilms.
AB  - To date the effect of silver-containing wound dressings on biofilms, known to be  present in chronic wounds, has not been determined or documented. In this current study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of a silver-containing dressing on biofilms grown in a chambered slide model. Before the addition of a wound dressing onto a 24-hour biofilm, composed of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, or a mixed bacterial community, a fluorescent dye was applied. This enabled the viability of sessile bacteria to be monitored in real-time, using a rapid form of confocal laser scanning microscopy over a contact time period of 48 hours. By analyzing all the three-dimensional data generated from the confocal time-lapse sequences, 90% of all sessile bacteria within the biofilm were observed to progressively turn red (i.e., died) within 24 hours. Total bacterial kill in the biofilm was achieved after 48 hours. This research has shown that the dressing was effective in killing the tested bacteria evident in both the tested mono and polymicrobial biofilms, which provides valuable evidence that this dressing may have an effect on biofilms found in recalcitrant chronic wounds.
TI  - [Prevalence of nosocomial infections in a university hospital (Dakar, Senegal)].
AB  - Nosocomial infections constitute today a great public health problem that is still ignored or poorly mastered in our health institutions. METHOD: A prevalence study initiated by the CLIN (committee for the prevention of nosocomial infections) was recently conducted at the Fann teaching hospital. A questionnaire was prepared and submitted to all patients that were hospitalized on the day of the study; the questionnaire allowed gathering a lot of information on exposure factors and clinical and microbiological arguments in favor of nosocomial infections. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five patients (59.9% of all available beds) participated in the study. Nosocomial infections were found mostly among people between 20 and 44 years of age and predominantly in women. Fifty-eight percent of those cases were found in the neurology unit. The infections were mostly urinary (40%) and pulmonary (25%). The germs responsible were multiresistant bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae secreting broad-spectrum betalactamase, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected patients were usually under antibiotic treatment (80%) with various protocols, mainly monotherapy. The antibiotics used were betalactams, fluoroquinolones, and nitroimidazoles.
TI  - [Microbiological monitoring of milk samples and surface samples in a hospital infant formula room].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analyze the microbiological quality of reconstituted milk formulas and the surface hygiene in a hospital infant formula room, in the context of a worldwide emergence of Enterobacter sakazakii infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over 3.5 years, monthly samples of reconstituted milk formulas as well as quarterly infant formula room surface samples were taken for bacteriological analysis. RESULTS: Of the 156 formulas analyzed, 54 carried microorganisms but no pathogenic bacteria. The presence of Bacillus species was found in 54% of the formulas for premature infants and in 19% of the other formulas (significant difference). Bacteria, probably brought by operators during reconstitution of the powdered formulas, were found in four of 156 samples (two negative-coagulase staphylococcus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and one Clostridium bifermentans). Surfaces were studied using 117 samples divided into 11 series: 4.3% of the points carried pathogenic bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bulhkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus). DISCUSSION: The presence of Bacillus species should be analyzed thoroughly so as to differentiate Bacillus cereus from other nonpathogenic species. The microbiological analysis techniques used for reconstituted infant formulas can be simplified. CONCLUSION: The quality of the infant formulas seems satisfactory. Hygiene practices provide good microbiological quality in reconstituted infant milk formulas. Microbiological monitoring of these preparations and the infant formula room surfaces is an important aspect of the quality assurance policy, which makes it possible to take corrective measures when an unsatisfactory result is found.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance and parenteral antibiotic use in a critical care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate parenteral antibiotic utilization and bacterial resistance patterns in a critical care unit (CrCU). DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective audit of infection site, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, parenteral antibiotic usage and duration, total antibiotic acquisition costs, and length of stay. SETTING: A 17-bed medical-surgical CrCU in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Metropolitan Toronto. PATIENTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients admitted to the CrCU between May 1995 and April 1996 who received antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were cefazolin (47%, 1098 g), gentamicin (33%,141 g) and ceftriaxone (20%, 255 g). The most common indications for antimicrobial therapy included surgical prophylaxis (34%) and pneumonia (35%). The following organisms were isolated from patients treated with antibiotics: Staphylococcus aureus (26%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), enterococci (12%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), Escherichia coli (11%), Enterobacter cloacae (8%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (19%). Only 9% of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to aminoglycosides, 3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and no extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or imipenem-resistance were detected. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci and only two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use during the audit appeared appropriate for the specific clinical indications. Low levels of bacterial resistance were detected during the audit.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - Application of clindamycin in therapy of orthopaedic infections with special regard to applicability in outpatients practice.
AB  - Background. There is presented the applicability of clindamycin alone or combined with chinolon group antibiotics in therapy of orthopaedic infections. <br /> Material and methods. In the period 1998-2002 a group of 47 patients underwent therepy due to soft tisue infection within extremities (9 patients), osteomyelitis (30) and periprosthetic infection (8). In 21 cases there was acute (within 1 month) and in 26 cases chronic infection. Etiologicaf factors include: Staphylococcus aureus (35), Acinetobacter baumani, Corynebacterium parvum, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia liquaefaciae, Morganella Morgagni. According to complex therapy protocol - procedure in deep infections included antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement with application of garamycin spongue.<br /> Results. Goud results i.e. permanent infection control was achiewed in 18 cases. Acceptable results i.e. temporary infection healing was achiewed in 16 cases. Poor result i.e. insatisfactory infection control was stated in 13 cases. <br /> Conclusions. Clinical effectiveness of clindamycin therapy as only agent or part of complex therapy in orthopaedic infections is varying depending on chronicity of infection and possibilities of radical surgical intervention. In empiric antimicrobial therapy a combination of clindamycin with chinolon group antibiotics is favourable.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance analysis in burns department].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium  and find the proper measures of infection control. METHODS: Six hundred and eighty-two pathogenic bacteria strains were isolated and cultured from samples collected from January 2003 to December 2005. The pathogenic bacterium distribution and antibiotic resistance were analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive ones. The gram-positive bacteria accounted for 292 strains (42.8%), in which the detection rate of staphylococcus aureus is highest (16.7% of total) and the detection rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 82.5% in staphylococcus aureus strains. Among 372 gram-negative bacteria strains (54.5%), the detection rate of bacillus aeruginosa, escherichia coli, baumannii and enterobacter cloacae were 12.5%, 11.1%, 9.1% and 8.2% respectively; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected in 45 (60.8%) escherichia coli and 9 (42.9%) klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Eighteen strains of fungus were found, and it decreased in last 2 years. The detection rate of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and the antibiotic resistant strains kept increasing in the 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium is very serious in burns department. The irrational use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the antibiotic detection of pathogenic bacterium are all contributed to the drug resistance. It is important to enhance the asepsis, prevent hospital infection, detect the pathogenic bacteria and use antibiotics rationally in burns department.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.
TI  - Structure--activity study of the antibacterial peptide fallaxin.
AB  - Fallaxin is a 25-mer antibacterial peptide amide, which was recently isolated from the West Indian mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax. Fallaxin has been shown to inhibit the growth of several Gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we report a structure-activity study of fallaxin based on 65 analogs, including a complete alanine scan and a full set of N- and C-terminal truncated analogs. The fallaxin analogs were tested for hemolytic activity and antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus, (VISA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. We identified several analogs, which showed improved antibacterial activity compared to fallaxin. Our best candidate was FA12, which displayed MIC values of 3.12, 25, 25, and 50 muM against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, MSSA, and VISA, respectively. Furthermore, we correlated the antibacterial activity with various structural parameters such as charge, hydrophobicity H, mean hydrophobic moment mu(H), and alpha-helicity. We were able to group the active and inactive analogs according to mean hydrophobicity H and mean hydrophobic moment mu(H). Far-UV CD-spectroscopy experiments on fallaxin and several analogs in buffer, in TFE, and in membrane mimetic environments (small unilamellar vesicles) indicated that a coiled-coil conformation could be an important structural trait for antibacterial activity. This study provides data that support fallaxin analogs as promising lead structures in the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Microbiological quality of indoor and outdoor swimming pools in Greece: investigation of the antibiotic resistance of the bacterial isolates.
AB  - During 1997-2005, the microbiological quality and susceptibility of bacterial isolates of swimming pool waters were investigated. A total of 462 water samples were collected from three indoor swimming pools (a teaching pool, a competition public pool, a hydrotherapy pool) and two outdoor swimming pools (a hotel semi-public and a residential private pool) in Northwestern Greece. All water samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria, protozoa and fungi and susceptibility tests were performed for the bacterial isolates. Sixty-seven percent of the examined water samples conformed to the microbiological standards and 32.9% exceeded at least one of the indicated limits. Out of 107 bacterial isolates, 38 (35.5%) resistant strains were detected. Multi-resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Leuconostoc, and Staphylococcus aureus (isolated from the teaching pool), Staphylococcus wernerii, Chryseobacterium indologenes and Ochrobactrum anthropi (isolated from the competition pool), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus (isolated from the hydrotherapy pool) and A. hydrophila (isolated from the hotel pool) were detected. The swimming pool with the poorest microbiological quality (THC 500 cfu/ml in 12.1% of the samples, P. aeruginosa counts 1500 cfu/100 ml in 6% of the samples) and the highest prevalence of multi-resistant isolates (73.6%) was the hydrotherapy pool. No Cryptosporidium or Giardia cysts and no Legionella, Mycobacteria and Salmonella were detected, but there were isolations of Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp., Mucor spp., Alternaria spp., Rhizopus spp., Trichophyton spp., and Penicillium spp.
TI  - Development of a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method for rapid identification of clinical isolates.
AB  - A base stacking hybridization-based microarray method was developed for rapid identification of clinical isolates within 2 h. The oligonucleotide probe sequences for species or genus-level identification were targeted against ribosomal RNA. Isolates were lysed and directly hybridized to the microarray-bound capture probes without conventional DNA or RNA isolation and prior polymerase chain reaction amplification. Five bacterial species encountered frequently in the clinical setting, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, and one genus Enterococcus, could be discriminated by the microarray-based assay. Identification by this method matched biochemical identification for 150 of 152 clinical strains. This base-stacking hybridization microarray offers a simple, fast (</=2 h), and accurate identification of bacterial cultures and is a potential tool for routine clinical diagnosis.
TI  - Pediatric pelvic osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pelvic osteomyelitis is unusual in children. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with this infection seen at our institution. From 1998 to 2005, 31 patients with pelvic osteomyelitis were identified: 19 males and 12 females with an age range of 1.5 months to 17 years 9 months. Duration of illness prior to admission ranged from 1 day to 2.5 months. Chief complaints included nonspecific pain, fever, limp, and decreased weight bearing. Microorganisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Enterobacter cloacae, and Kingella kingae. Bones involved were acetabulum/ilium (22 patients), ischium (7 patients), and pubis (4 patients); 2 patients had several bones involved. Imaging studies performed included magnetic resonance imaging (21 patients), computed tomography (14 patients), and nuclear bone scan (25 patients). Our study, the largest contemporary series of pediatric pelvic osteomyelitis from one institution, highlights the consequences of prolonged duration of illness and delayed diagnosis.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens recovered from vegetables irrigated by wastewater in Morocco.
AB  - The authors obtained 50 vegetable samples from various regions in Morocco and examined them to determine the microbiological quality of these products. Aerobic count, coliform, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. This analysis revealed high levels of enterococci, fecal coliforms, and total coliforms. No coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was detected in any of the samples analyzed. Biochemical identification of Enterobacteriaceae showed the presence of Citrobacter freundii (28 percent), Enterobacter cloacae (27 percent), Escherichia coli (16 percent), Enterobacter sakazakii (12 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 percent), Serratia liquefaciens (11 percent), and Salmonella arizonae (0.7 percent). The results clearly demonstrate that vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater have a high level of microbiological contamination. Consequently, these vegetables may be a threat for the Moroccan consumer and may be considered a serious risk to Moroccan public health.
TI  - [Drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  - AIM: Patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. It is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. METHODS: Pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. Isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. Isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. The number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 6, Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and Enterobacter cloacae 6. Only two isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (PSSP), while the others were penicillin-resistant (PRSP) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (PISP) (5). Among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (LVFX). Escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being resistant to LVFX. Escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to LVFX; with one of them being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). CONCLUSION: The frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in Japan. In particular, attention should be focused on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Screening methods used to determine the anti-microbial properties of Aloe vera inner gel.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains is a growing problem and  is an important concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers as it results in poorer health and economic outcomes. This has led to an urgent global call for new antimicrobial drugs, particularly from natural resources. We have been studying the antimicrobial properties of the inner leaf gel component of Aloe barbadensis Miller and have used a number of different, simple in vitro assays to establish a scientific basis for the potential use of Aloe vera on a range of clinically relevant bacteria. The bacteria used include Shigella flexneri, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus bovis. In this paper, we compare standard methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with a microtitre assay using a metabolic colour indicator Alamar blue. All the techniques described have shown that Aloe vera has an antimicrobial effect, however, the microtitre assay enables high throughput screening, under similar conditions and is less wasteful of plant material.
TI  - Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms. However, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in VAP. Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of ertapenem in the treatment of VAP caused by susceptible ESBL strains. METHODS: Ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of VAP beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: From June 2005 to June 2006, we enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an ICU and diagnosed with VAP due to Gram-negative ESBL strains. Causative organisms identified as ESBL producers susceptible to ertapenem were Klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Citrobacter freundii (2). Clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. The drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem appears to be suitable for ESBL VAP therapy. This pilot study suggests subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica.
AB  - Bacteriological examination of 70 nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica was performed to investigate nasal and cloacal aerobic bacteria. A total of 325 bacterial isolates were obtained, including 10 Gram-negative and three Gram-positive genera. Two hundred thirty-nine were Gram-negative and 86 were Gram-positive isolates. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common microbe identified in turtle samples: 27/70 (38.5%) in cloacal, and 33/70 (47.1%) in nasal samples. The Enterobacteriaceae family, including Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens, was the largest Gram-negative group of bacteria recovered and comprised 127 of 239 (53.1%) of the Gram-negative isolates. Staphylococcus species was the largest Gram-positive bacteria group, including S. aureus, S. cromogenes, S. epidermis, and S. intermedius, and made up 63 of 86 (73.2%) of the Gram-positive isolates recovered. The results of this study demonstrate that the aerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles at Tortuguero National Park is composed of a very wide spectrum of bacteria, including several potential pathogens.

TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. In this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. Every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. Cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. These rates were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. RESULTS: A total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. Only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii group, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (P < or = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. Previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - [Management of tertiary peritonitis in the patients complicated with intestinal fistula].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and management of tertiary peritonitis in  the patients with intestinal fistula. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three cases of intestinal fistula complicated with tertiary peritonitis were reviewed. The microbiological characteristics, treatment Methods and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 114 males and 39 females with a mean age of (42+/- 19) years. The main causes of intestinal fistula included gastrointestinal surgery (40.5%), trauma (31.4%) and severe pancreatitis (14.4%), etc. The most common cultured bacteria of 157 specimens from 79 patients with tertiary peritonitis were Escherichia coli (24.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%). Debridement of the necrotic tissues, drainage of the abscess, continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage and antibiotics treatment were performed in 52 cases. Nineteen patients only changed from simple tube drainage to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage. Twenty- eight patients changed to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage and received antibiotics as well. Thirty- six patients received antibiotics and ecoimmune nutrition, while 18 patients only received ecoimmun nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal fistula complicated with tertiary peritonitis was mainly caused by residual infectious focus and inappropriate drainage. The rational treatments include reoperation for debridement of the necrotic and infectious tissues, changing drainage to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage, appropriate usage of antibiotics, and ecoimmune nutrition.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - Molecular modeling and chemical reactivity of sanfetrinem and derivatives.
AB  - The indiscriminate use of beta-lactams has considerably diminished their efficiency as a result of bacteria developing effective defense mechanisms against them. Recent pharmaceutical research has led to the synthesis of tricyclic beta-lactam antibiotics known as "tricyclic carbapenems" or "trinems". In this work, we studied the chemical reactivity, an essential property for antibiotic action, of trinems and found it to be similar to that of cephalosporins. Also, we elucidated the interaction pattern for sanfetrinem and 4beta-methoxy trinem and compared it to that for classical beta-lactams. The behavior of both trinems was found to be similar to that of penicillin G toward Staphylococcus aureus PC1, and that of cephalothin and imipenem toward Enterobacter cloacae P99.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Recurrent osteomyelitis caused by infection with different bacterial strains without obvious source of reinfection.
AB  - Recurrence of osteomyelitis by the same bacterial strain is well known. We report three patients with a second episode of osteomyelitis at the same site caused by different strains of bacteria from the original. Formerly infected and altered bone surface might present a region of diminished resistance for a new infection.
TI  - Microbial contamination of preservative free eye drops in multiple application containers.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The majority of eye drops used in the United Kingdom contain preservatives and are bottled in plastic containers. Preservative free drops are used to avoid ocular irritation and allergies in certain individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of microbial contamination of preservative free drops dispensed from multiusage containers. METHODS: Eye drop bottles were collected from patients attending the Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology outpatient and inpatient departments. The bottles were collected on day 3 (for inpatients) and day 7 (for outpatients) of use. The drops were inoculated onto different culture plates (chocolate agar, blood agar, fungal culture media, and enriched media) and the resulting microbial growth was identified using standard microbial identification techniques. RESULTS: 95 eye drop bottles were collected, containing a variety of 10 different eye drops. Significant bacterial growth was found in eight bottles. In total, seven different types of organism were identified from the eye drops. The organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus, Bacillus spp, Serattia spp, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and alpha streptococcus. Staph aureus was the commonest microbial organism. CONCLUSION: Preservative free eye drops in multiple application containers are at risk of contamination by potentially pathogenic micro-organisms.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Influence of cytokine preparations on the in vitro resistance of bacteria to antibiotics].
AB  - Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha and gamma-interferon were found in vitro  to increase the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics both alone and in combination; alpha2-interferon decreased this sensitivity.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (FOM) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. The in vitro activity of FOM against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria using Mueller-Hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without G6P. However, the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to FOM remained largely unchanged with or without G6P. There was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. FOM demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent manner, and decreased viable cell counts of Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of P. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with FOM at four times the MIC. First and second generation cephalosporins induced AmpC-type beta-lactamase in a dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. On the other hand, inducible activity of FOM on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. In addition, FOM maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. FOM was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexXY/ OprM and MexEF-OprN, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ. In conclusion, FOM provides adequate coverage for both aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. Further, FOM would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  - A microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. Representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were printed on a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. Within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. This approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - [An investigation of bacterial ecology and analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in a burn ward in Nanning district].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the bacterial ecology and to analyze the bacterial resistance to antibiotics in a burn ward in Nanning district during the past 15 years, so as to provide reference to the clinical management of burn infection under subtropical climate. METHODS: Five thousand eight hundred and fifty-five strains of bacteria were isolated from the wounds and blood of 2269 burn patients admitted to our hospital from April of 1989 to March of 2004. Kiry-Bauer method was employed for the detection of antibiotic sensitivity test. The bacterial examination and bacterial resistance were analyzed in spans of every five years. RESULTS: Burn patients in our district were mainly infected by the gram negative bacilli (3559 strains, accounting for 60.79%), among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Nitrate negative bacilli were major ones in every period. Gram positive cocci accounted for 33.99% (1990 strains), which ranked the second, among which Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCNS) were the most predominant ones. The bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics, such as Gentamicin, third generation of Cephalosporin, and Norfloxacin showed a tendency of increase or maintained at high level while the incidence of resistance to Imipenem and Vancomycin was very low. CONCLUSION: The climate and the way of using antibiotics exerted direct effects on the status of the bacterial ecology and change in bacterial resistance to various antibiotics.
TI  - Microbial contamination of hematopoietic progenitor cell grafts-incidence, clinical outcome, and cost-effectiveness: an analysis of 735 grafts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening of progenitor cell grafts (marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood) for microbial contamination is required by the standards of AABB. Clinical sequelae from infusion of these contaminated grafts, however, is uncommon. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 735 consecutive marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell harvests between 1998 and 2003 was performed. Analysis included incidence, clinical outcome, and cost outcomes of positive blood cultures and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 735 (4.5%) harvests were contaminated. The incidence of microbial contamination varied with the source of the graft (4 of 26 [15%] were cord blood, 8 of 177 [4.5%] were marrow, and 21 of 532 [3.9%] were peripheral blood). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=22) and Propionibacterium acnes (n=8) were most frequently isolated. Potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated in 6 of 735 (0.81%) grafts (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 4; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1; and Enterobacter cloacae, 1). The estimated total cost of surveillance was approximately $81,585. The cost of vancomycin therapy in 4 patients who received prophylactic antibiotic therapy was approximately $10,000. No adverse sequelae followed infusion of contaminated grafts. CONCLUSION: Clinical sequelae following infusion of microbially contaminated progenitor cells is extremely rare. Prophylactic empiric antibiotics may be unnecessary. Routine microbial surveillance of progenitor cell grafts is a low-yield procedure.
TI  - Temporal changes in bacterial resistance in German intensive care units, 2001-2003: data from the SARI (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units) project.
AB  - Conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae in 32 German intensive care units (ICUs) actively participating in the SARI (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in ICUs) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). No significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (P=0.501; the MRSA rate increased in 18 ICUs and decreased in 14 ICUs). The only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  - Bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. No information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. Supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased Romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than 20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic DNA probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. Thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. Respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. Hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. Our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.
TI  - Mechanisms of resistance of bacteria causing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - The common causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter spp) are frequently resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. S aureus develops resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics by producing a modified penicillin-binding protein. Linezolid resistance arises by way of mutations in the 23S ribosomal subunit. Antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli usually arises by way of beta-lactamase production, upregulation of efflux pumps, or loss of outer membrane proteins. The ability of bacteria to develop and disseminate new mechanisms of antibiotic resistance may outstrip the availability of new antibiotic classes.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - The effect of an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing on specific bacterial isolates at tracheostomy sites.
AB  - Patients with tracheostomies frequently experience complications, including bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, and multi antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. A prospective, descriptive, randomized, controlled, clinical case series involving seven men and three women was conducted on patients in the neuroscience unit of a long-term rehabilitation hospital during a period of 25 days to compare the use of an nonwoven drain sponge dressing containing an antimicrobial (polyhexamethylene biguanide) to a non-impregnated, nonwoven drain sponge dressing on tracheostomy sites. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to compare the presence of four bacterial pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) and resident normal skin flora (alpha-hemolytic Streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) at the tracheostomy sites. Culture results for total days of growth showed an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for 11 study days in patients randomized to the antimicrobial dressing group and an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for six study days in patients randomized to the control group. The results of this descriptive case series suggest that an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing could be an important adjunct in the control of infections in patients with tracheostomies without compromising normal skin flora.
TI  - Bacillary angiomatosis in an immunocompetent child with a grafted traumatic wound.
AB  - Bacillary angiomatosis is an infectious disease which usually develops in immunocompromised patients. Contact with cats is implicated in its pathogenesis. We report a seven-year-old immunocompetent boy with bacillary angiomatosis without a history of direct contact with cats. The clinical diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis was made following histopathological examination of a biopsy sample from the infected facial wound, in the vicinity of which angiomatous lesions had developed. Surprisingly, similar lesions also appeared at the donor site of the skin graft which was grafted on the facial wound. This case demonstrates that bacillary angiomatosis may also be seen in immunocompetent patients and that it may contaminate wounds without the intermediary of cats.
TI  - [Bactericial activity of chlorhexidine gluconate against recent clinical isolates of various bacterial species in Japan].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) were determined for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Eterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, isolated from patients in medical institutions all over Japan between 2000 and 2002. The following findings were obtained. 1. The MICs of CHG against MSSA, MRSA, E. coli and B. cepacia were 0.002% or less, and those against S. marcescens, E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa were 0.008% or less. 2. Rapid and strong bactericidal effects of CHG were observed against all clinical isolates of E. coli, E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa tested even at relatively low concentrations (0.02 to 0.05%). 3. Relatively high concentration or prolonged treatment time was required to achieve sufficient bactericidal effect of CHG against some isolates of S. aureus, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. These results suggest that CHG is useful antiseptic agent or disinfectant for recent clinical isolates of various bacterial pathogens. In addition, the selection of treatment concentration and treatment time for each organism and purpose was important to obtain sufficient bactericidal effect.
TI  - [Orbital cellulitis in children: a retrospective study of 33].
AB  - Orbital cellulitis is rare. However the high risk of severe ocular and neurological complications make early diagnosis and adequate therapy essential. The purpose of this retrospective study is to describe 33 cases observed in the pediatric infectious disease department of the Casablanca Children's Hospital in Morocco from 1994 to 2000. Orbital cellulitis was preseptal in 24 patients and retroseptal in 9. Infection occurred in relation with sinusitis in 10 cases, polydermitis in 8, wound infection in 6, ocular infection in 2, and dental abscess in 2. Ages ranged from 40 days to 15 years with a mean age of 5 years. Infants accounted for 25% of cases and always presented preseptal cellulitis. Fever and local edema were noted in all patients. Exophthalmia occurred in six patients and seizures in 2. The 9 cases of retroseptal cellulitis were complicated by empyema in 2 cases, meningitis in 1 case and thrombophlebitis of cavernous sinus with cerebromalacia in 1 case. Bacteriological testing identified micro-organisms in 10 cases, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Streptococcus B in 1, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Enterobacter Cloacae in land Acinitobacter jejuni in 1 case. Therapy was based on broad-spectrum antibiotics in association with surgery in the patient presenting in intracranial abscess. Ophthalmoplegia-like sequels including blindness, aphasia, and motor deficit occurred in 2 patients. Orbital cellulitis in children are usually preseptal and have a favorable prognosis. However prompt and adequate antibiotherapy is essential due to the risk of retroseptal involvement with inflammatory palpberal edema and possible cerebral extension.
TI  - [Investigation of pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in neurological intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic bacterial spectrum responsible for pulmonary infections and their drug resistance in patients admitted to neurological care unit. METHODS: Sputum specimens were obtained from patients who developed pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit between January, 2001 and June, 2002 for bacterial culture and isolation. K-B paper disc method was employed for determination of the drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: In the 207 strains obtained from the patients, the majority (68.51%) were Gram-negative and 30.91/ Gram-positive bacteria, with fungi detected in one case (0.48%). The major pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infection were, in the order of frequency, Staphylococcus aureus(14.49%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.49%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.76%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (6.28%). Drug sensitivity tests showed increased drug resistance of the bacteria, but Staphylococcus aureus still remained sensitive to vancomycin and most of the Gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The major pathogenic bacteria causing pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their drug resistance is obviously increased, suggesting the necessity of strengthening bacterial surveillance and more adequate clinical use of antibiotics.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing tricyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: crystallographic structures show unexpected binding of 1,4-thiazepine intermediates.
AB  - The design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class A and C serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. These compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the TEM-1 and AmpC beta-lactamases and less so against the class B metallo-beta-lactamase CcrA. In combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility of all class C resistant strains from various bacteria. Crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class A SHV-1 and class C GC1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 A, respectively, and refined to R-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. In both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. The stereogenic C7 atom in the ring has the R configuration in the SHV-1 intermediate and has both R and S configurations in the GC1 intermediate. Hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic C7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the C3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. The formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.
TI  - An antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae).
AB  - A 25 amino-acid-residue, C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae). The amino acid sequence of the peptide (Gly-Val-Val-Asp-Ile-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asp-Ile-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys- Val-Met-Asn-Lys-Leu.NH2) shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus Rana that are only distantly related to the Leptodactylidae. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral gene that existed before the radiation of the different families. Fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (MIC> or =20 microM) and was inactive against the Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and the yeast Candida albicans. The hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (HC50>200 microM). A second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated from the skin secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms tested.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Direct detection of bacterial pathogens in brain abscesses by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid fragments.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of detecting bacterial pathogens directly  from the clinical brain abscess specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). METHODS: A total of 14 specimens were tested by both culture and PCR amplification, targeting the full-length or a partial region of 16S rDNA. 16S rDNA is known to be conserved in bacteria. Sequencing of partial-length and full-length 16S rDNA was performed. The sequence data were compared with known sequences of 16S rDNA in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. The species with the best match of similarity were regarded as the pathogenic species in the samples. We also developed a Streptococcus-specific multiplex PCR analysis for identifying members of the Streptococcus species, the most common pathogen of brain abscesses. RESULTS: The 10 culture-positive specimens were all PCR-positive for partial 16S rDNA, but only seven were positive for full-length 16S rDNA amplification. Bacterial DNA was not detected in the remaining four specimens with a negative culture. Species identification by phenotypes from culture was in agreement with that by sequencing results of partial-length (or full-length) 16S rDNA. The Streptococcus-specific PCR analysis could detect Streptococcus species correctly in one step. CONCLUSION: Bacterial 16S rDNA sequences provide reliable clues to the identification of unknown pathogens. PCR analysis of 16S rDNA and sequencing may identify pathogens to the species level directly from brain abscesses. This approach is rapid and is useful especially in the identification of slow-growing and fastidious organisms.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some netropsin analogues.
AB  - Nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The netropsin residues were modified by the use of N-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual N-methylpyrrole. The compounds were tested against five gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and three fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. Some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Benzopyranones with retro-amide side chains as (inhibitory) beta-lactamase substrates.
AB  - 3-(N-Benzylcarbamoyl)-7-carboxy-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzo-pyran-2-one and its 8-carboxy analogue have been synthesized and evaluated as potential (inhibitory) substrates of beta-lactam-recognizing enzymes. These compounds are bicyclic delta-lactones with retro-amide (with respect to classical beta-lactams) side chains. They were found to be comparably effective as substrates of typical class A, C and D beta-lactamases as analogous benzopyranones bearing 'normal' amide side chains. The new 8-carboxy derivative, however, formed a much more (1000-fold) tightly-bound acyl-enzyme with a class C beta-lactamase than did its 'normal' analogue, and thus provides a structural lead to new inhibitors of this class of beta-lactamase.
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Gram-positive merA gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  - Clinical mercury resistant (Hg(r)) Gram-negative bacteria carrying Gram-positive  mercury reductase (merA)-like genes were characterized using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR and sequencing. A PCR assay was developed which discriminated between the merA genes related to Staphylococcus and those related to the Bacillus/Streptococcus merA genes by the difference in size of the PCR product. DNA sequence analysis correlated with the PCR assay. The merA genes from Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus MerA protein. A fourth merA gene, from Pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the Streptococcus oralis MerA protein. All the Hg(r) Gram-negative bacteria transferred their Gram-positive merA genes to a Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants expressing mercury resistance. These Gram-positive merA genes join Gram-positive tetracycline resistance and Gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Prevention of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections using non-technologic strategies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of nosocomial bacteremias related to the use of non-impregnated central venous catheters (CVCs) when only non-technologic strategies were used to prevent them. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of infectious complications of CVCs placed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients from April 1997 to December 2001. SETTING: The medical-surgical ICU of a tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital in Argentina. METHODS: We studied all patients admitted to the ICU using non-impregnated CVCs. Maximal sterile barrier precautions (ie, use of cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and large sterile drape), strict handwashing, preparation of the patients' skin with antiseptic solutions, insertion and management of catheters by trained personnel, and continuing quality improvement programs aimed at appropriate insertion and maintenance of catheters were employed. RESULTS: During the study period, 2,525 patients were admitted to the ICU. Eight hundred sixty-eight patients had 1,037 CVCs inserted. The number of CVC-related bloodstream infections (BSIs), acquired in the ICU, was 2.7 per 1,000 CVC-days (13 nosocomial CVC-related BSIs during 4,770 days of CVC use). Microorganisms isolated included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 2), coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: A low rate of catheter-related BSI was achieved without antimicrobial-impregnated catheters. The incidence of CVC-associated bacteremias corresponded to the 10th to 20th percentile range of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System hospitals for the same type of ICU.
TI  - Effect of ertapenem protein binding on killing of bacteria.
AB  - The effect of protein binding on the antimicrobial activity of ertapenem was evaluated using the bacterial kill rate and concentration-response studies. Various proportions of human serum were utilized to determine the total and free-drug concentrations using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The MICs and kill curves were determined for test isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus at various percentages of human serum. The killing of bacteria was analyzed in relation to the free and total concentrations of ertapenem at various proportions of human serum. It was determined that unbound ertapenem was responsible for the antimicrobial activity against the test isolates.
TI  - Trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. The growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. The aim of this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. METHODS: The characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. A total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during this period. Among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: The majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%), and anaerobes (3%). In decreasing frequency, Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major Gram-positive pathogens. Two-thirds (20/30) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. Resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of E. cloacae, 13% of K. pneumoniae and 10% of E. coli. Overall, 33% of E. coli and 13% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital is different from western countries in that Gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.
TI  - Thermodynamic evaluation of a covalently bonded transition state analogue inhibitor: inhibition of beta-lactamases by phosphonates.
AB  - Serine beta-lactamases are inhibited by phosphonate monoesters in a reaction that involves phosphonylation of the active site serine residue. This reaction is much more rapid than the hydrolysis of these inhibitors in solution under the same conditions. The beta-lactamase active site therefore must have the ability to stabilize not only the anionic tetrahedral transition states of the acyl transfer reactions of substrates but also the pentacoordinated transition state(s) of phosphyl transfer reactions. A series of p-nitrophenyl arylphosphonates have been synthesized and the rate constants for their inhibition of the class C beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 determined. There is no direct correlation between these rate constants and the dissociation constants of analogous aryl boronic acids, where the latter are believed to generate good tetrahedral transition state analogue structures. Thus, the mode of stabilization of pentacoordinated phosphorus transition states by the beta-lactamase active site is qualitatively different from that of tetrahedral transition states. Molecular modeling suggests that the difference arises from different positioning of the side chain and of one of the oxygen ligands. In principle, the quality of the stable tetrahedral phosphonate complex as a transition state analogue structure can be assessed from the effect of its formation on the stability of the protein. Phosphonylation of the P99 beta-lactamase, however, had little effect on the stability of the protein, as measured both by thermal and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Consideration of the results of similar experiments with the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase, where considerable stabilization is observed in thermal melting and, to a lesser degree, in formation of the molten globule in guanidine hydrochloride, but not in the complete unfolding transition in guanidine, suggests that results from the method may be strongly influenced by the interactions of the ligand with its environment in the unfolded state of the protein. Thus, quantitative estimates of the quality of a covalently bonded transition state analogue cannot generally be achieved by this method.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  - Standard microbiological tests (i.e., MIC) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. Our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (PFT) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. The methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. Thirty-six clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. In the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis. Titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. Titers were highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. Overall, PFTs were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.0001). The addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.0001). In the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (P = 0.036). In conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the PFT as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. With further characterization and validation in patients, the PFT test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for PD-related peritonitis.
TI  - Neonatal bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit: analysis of causative organisms and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections cause significant mortality and morbidity in neonates, especially the premature ones. Although there are various antibiotics can be used to combat neonatal infection, resistant strains have subsequently emerged. In an epidemiological survey, we analyzed bacterial isolates and their antibiotic susceptibilities for cases of bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a teaching hospital. METHODS: From November 1999 to October 2001, 623 neonates admitted to the NICU were enrolled. The incidence and incidence density of bacteremia, morbidity and mortality of sepsis, as well as antibiotic susceptibility, were investigated. RESULTS: Totally, 754 blood cultures were done on 623 patients. Fifty-eight patients experienced 85 episodes of bacteremia, with 87 isolates cultured. The incidence of bacteremia in our NICU was 9.31% (58/623) with an incidence density of 10.98/1000 patient-days. The overall mortality rate was 7.22%. The case fatality rate of bacteremia was 20.7% (12/58). The bacterial pathogens encountered, in order of frequency, were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (29%), Staphylococcus aureus (22%), and Enterobacter cloacae (17%). All of the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin, while the gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Oxacillin-resistant S. epidermidis, oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, and multi-drug resistant enterobacteriae were the leading microorganisms causing bacteremia in our NICU. CONCLUSIONS: It is an endless struggle to combat neonatal infection. Periodic evaluation of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is necessary. More judicious selection of antibiotics and rotating antibiotic regimens should be kept in mind to reduce the resurgence of multidrug resistant strains.
TI  - Characteristics of nosocomial bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - Nosocomial meningitis is uncommon in children. We reviewed the medical records of all children who developed bacterial meningitis at least 72 hours after admission to Mackay Memorial Hospital for the period July 1992 through June 2000. Clinical manifestations, predisposing factors, pathogens, and outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-two cases of nosocomial meningitis were identified, comprising 9.2% (22/239) of all pediatric cases of bacterial meningitis during the study period. The male-to-female ratio was 14:8. All patients were younger than 6 months of age except for one, who was 7 years old. The mean duration between admission and onset of meningitis was 15.3 days (range, 3 to 58 days). Twenty-two organisms were isolated, including 13 Gram-negative bacteria (59%) and 9 Gram-positive bacteria (41%). The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (5 cases), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (3), and Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (3). Seventeen patients (77%) had concomitant bacteremia. Predisposing factors for acquisition of nosocomial meningitis included previous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics (68%), prematurity with very low birth weight (41%), and total parenteral nutrition (32%). Two patients (9%) had previous neurosurgical intervention. Four patients (18%) died, 3 of whom were low birth weight premature infants. Nine patients (41%) had sequelae, including developmental delay, hydrocephalus, hearing impairment, and epilepsy. Neurosurgery was not a significant risk factor for the development of nosocomial meningitis, while very low birth weight played an important role. Previous intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus, prematurity with very low birth weight, infection with Gram-negative bacteria, and prior broad-spectrum antibiotic administration were associated with poor outcome.
TI  - Sepsis in burned patients.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil. During the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the Burns Unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis. Twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). Forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. These 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. Forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. Thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. Out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to Candida sp. The most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were Staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. The primary foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. The most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. The most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. Twelve (24.5%) patients died. The appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - [Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. Studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of ORSA].
AB  - In this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between January 2002 and May 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. We isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were Staphylococcus aureus, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 Escherichia coli, 4 Proteus mirabilis, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Serratia marcescens, 2 Streptococcus group G und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. Moreover we identified one patient with Candida parapsilosis. Therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed Staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. Determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. Consequently, 30.4% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were ORSA strains. All of the ORSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the ORSA-positive patients. In the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. Beside the obligate resistance to oxacillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the ORSA was sensitive to ofloxacin. The results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of ORSA.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in Thailand.
AB  - The authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, Aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. A total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. The most frequently isolated organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pasteurella species. There were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. From the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. One or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. Two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. The predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds were, as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Moraxella species, Pasteurella canis, and Enterobacter cloacae. However, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. The results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Mechanism of action of NB2001 and NB2030, novel antibacterial agents activated by beta-lactamases.
AB  - Two potent antibacterial agents designed to undergo enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic  activation were evaluated for their mechanisms of action. The compounds, NB2001 and NB2030, contain a cephalosporin with a thienyl (NB2001) or a tetrazole (NB2030) ring at the C-7 position and are linked to the antibacterial triclosan at the C-3 position. The compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. Like cephalothin, NB2001 and NB2030 were hydrolyzed by class A beta-lactamases (Escherichia coli TEM-1 and, to a lesser degree, Staphylococcus aureus PC1) and class C beta-lactamases (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and E. coli AmpC) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)). They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and E. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in E. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. The transport of NB2001, NB2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both S. aureus and E. coli. Taken together, the results suggest that NB2001 and NB2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in S. aureus and E. coli.
TI  - An in vitro study of the anti-microbial efficacy of a 1% silver sulphadiazine and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate cream, 1% silver sulphadiazine cream and a silver coated dressing.
AB  - Burn sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with major  burns. The use of topical anti-microbial agents has helped improve the survival in these patients. There are a number of anti-microbials available, one of which, Silvazine (1% silver sulphadiazine (SSD) and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate), is used only in Australasia. No study, in vitro or clinical, had compared Silvazine with the new dressing Acticoat. This study compared the anti-microbial activity of Silvazine, Acticoat and 1% silver sulphadiazine (Flamazine) against eight common burn wound pathogens. METHODS: Each organism was prepared as a suspension. A 10 microl inoculum of the chosen bacterial isolate (representing approximately between 10(4) and 10(5) total bacteria) was added to each of four vials, followed by samples of each dressing and a control. The broths were then incubated and 10 microl loops removed at specified intervals and transferred onto Horse Blood Agar. These plates were then incubated for 18 hours and a colony count was performed. RESULTS: The data demonstrates that the combination of 1% SSD and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (Silvazine) results in the most effective killing of all bacteria. SSD and Acticoat had similar efficacies against a number of isolates, but Acticoat seemed only bacteriostatic against E. faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Viable quantities of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis remained at 24h. CONCLUSION: The combination of 1% SSD and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (Silvazine) is a more effective anti-microbial against a number of burn wound pathogens in this in vitro study. A clinical study of its in vivo anti-microbial efficacy is required.
TI  - [Infective pathogens and drug resistance in burned patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the changes in the infective pathogens and their drug resistance in burned patients. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups. The first group was from July 1991 to June 1996, and the second group was from July 1996 to June 2001. The bacteria of burned body surface and blood were cultured, and the bacteria and their drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were the major bacteria in burn infection, among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the top. Staphylococcus aureous ranked the first among the Gram-positive bacteria, and the isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased; The isolation rate of Enterobacter cloacae (10.4%), Escherichia coli (8.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%), and fungus (4.2%) all rose. The antibiotic resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureous increased. CONCLUSION: The changes in pathogens of burn infection and bacterial drug resistance are related to the wide use of broad spectrum antibiotics such as cefazidime and imepenem, suggesting that dynamic observation of changes in pathogenic strains and sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics are useful for clinical prevention and cure of burn infection.

TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - Are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: All patients admitted to a 31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. RESULTS: Of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. The lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. The main resistant microorganisms were Enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Enterobacter cloacae. The main susceptible microorganisms were Enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and Proteus mirabilis. Patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). The maximum degrees of organ failure during the ICU stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. Multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is not an independent predictor for death. The development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the ICU length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - The biological activity of antibacterial substance produced by Enterobacter cloacae B8.
AB  - An antibacterial substance was extracted and purified from the culture of Enterobacter cloacae B8 and the antagonistic activities of the extract to 229 clinical pathogen strains was tested by the K-B paper-dish method. The extract of Enterobacter cloacae B8 showed strongly antagonistic activity to all 146 tested stains of Staphylococcus spp.; the antagonistic diameter was about 18-32 mm, averaging about 26.5 mm; showing especially strong antagonistic activity to all 87 tested strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the average antagonistic diameter was about 22.6 mm. The average antagonistic diameter of the extract of Enterobacter cloacae B8 to 3 tested strains of Escherchia coli and 8 tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae was about 14 mm and 13 mm, respectively; showing only antagonistic activities to 3 strains of Acinetobacter spp. in 26 tested strains, and showing no antagonistic activities to all 25 tested strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of partially purified extract against MRSA was about 9.4 micrograms/ml determined by disc-diffusion method, and the MIC of Vancomycin was about 3.1 micrograms/ml as the control in this study.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  - Faropenem (FAR) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. This study compared FAR to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (BLA) stability and emergence of resistance to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. BLA stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. Substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. Aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. FAR as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from S. aureus and E. coli. However, E. coli- and P. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas FAR was highly stable. FAR was highly stable against hydrolysis by various BLAs prepared from four B. fragilis strains and the rate of FAR hydrolysis by metallo-BLA was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. Additionally, the acquisition of resistant S. aureus strains was less pronounced for FAR compared to other agents tested. MICs rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-MIC exposure, while MICs rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. E. coli shifts in MICs were moderate for all the agents tested. In conclusion, FAR is characterized by pronounced BLA stability compared to other cephalosporins and imipenem. Furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with FAR as compared to cephalosporins was observed.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - A hospitalwide intervention program to optimize the quality of antibiotic use: impact on prescribing practice, antibiotic consumption, cost savings, and bacterial resistance.
AB  - Several findings from Argentina provide compelling evidence of the need for more  rational use of antimicrobial agents. Thus, a multidisciplinary antimicrobial treatment committee for the development of a hospital-wide intervention program was formed to optimize the quality of antibiotic use in hospitals. Four successive steps were developed during 6-month periods: baseline data collection, introduction of a prescription form, education, and prescribing control. Sustained reduction of drug consumption was shown during the study (R2=0.6885; P=.01). Total cost savings was 913,236 US dollars. To estimate the consumption of cefepime and aminopenicillin-sulbactam in relation to that of the third-generation cephalosporins, 2 indices were calculated: Icfp and Iams, respectively. Decreasing resistance to ceftriaxone by Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae proved to be associated with increasing Icfp. Decreasing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were related to increasing Iams. The present study indicates that a systematic program performed by a multidisciplinary team is a cost-effective strategy for optimizing antibiotic prescribing.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infections in patients during hospital stay after heart transplantation.
AB  - A retrospective analysis was performed on the records of 95 pts who underwent heart transplantation at Dept. Of Cardiac Surgery & Transplantation in 1999 and 2000 y. In 34 pts lower respiratory tract infections were observed. In all cases bacterial factor was detected in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. In study population we analysed influence of such factors as age of the patients, the intensity and duration of immunosuppression, pre-existing diseases and timing after transplantation on the incidence of infection. Most often, in 43 pts gram negative stains bacteria was detected. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 pts), Acinetobacter baumanii (7 pts) and Enterobacter cloacae (6 pts) were predominant. Gram positive stains bacteria was detected only in two cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). In 1 pt we observed lung tuberculosis and in 2 pts Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Older recipient age was the only risk factor leading to occurrence of respiratory tract infections in patients after heart transplantation.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and beta-lactamase producibility of various types of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity and drug sensitivity were measured in 744 strains from 8  species of bacteria isolated at medical institutions in Chikugo District of Fukuoka Prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Nitrocefin test revealed that beta-lactamase was positive in 48% of S. aureus, 7% of H. influenzae, and 92% of M. catarrhalis, and acidometry revealed that penicillinase/cephalosporinase were positive in 13%/14% of E. coli, 22%/8% of K. pneumoniae, 47%/97% of E. cloacae, 3%/65% of S. marcescens, and 10%/36% of P. aeruginosa. Based on the assessment of the MIC values of various types of antibacterial drugs for beta-lactamase-producing strains, there were 11 strains (1 strain of K. pneumonia, 6 strains of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa) of class-B beta-lactamase-producing bacteria out of a total of 496 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of PCR analysis suggested that 1 strain of K. pneumonia, 1 strain of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa produced metallo-beta-lactamase. There was no strain (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) of ESBL-producing bacteria. BLNAR strains, on the other hand, were found in 9% (9/100) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates during January and February 2000 in the Kinki area of Japan].
AB  - We studied antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates in the Kinki area of Japan. Eight hundreds isolates of eight organisms were collected by seven medical institutions during January and February 2000. The rates of beta-lactamase producing by using the chromogenic nitrocephin test were 68.0% against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 6.0% against Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 98.0% against Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. The rate of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was 4.0% (4 out of 100). The result of beta-lactamase producing by using the acid-metric method were as follows the penicillinase and cephalosporinase: 27.0% and 37.0% against Escherichia coli isolates, 37.0% and 1.0% against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 21.8% and 100% against Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 24.2% and 96.0% against Serratia marcescens isolates, 7.0% and 22.0% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. We identified beta-lactamase type of each isolate detected by polymerase chain reaction: SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) (1 isolate of E. coli and 1 isolate of K. pneumoniae), CTX-M-1-derived ESBLs (1 isolate of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. cloacae and 4 of S. marcescens), and IMP-1-derived metallo beta-lactamases (2 isolates of S. marcescens).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Novel antibiotic-resistance markers in pGK12-derived vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  - Extension of molecular genetics studies in Borrelia burgdorferi has been hampered by a lack of a variety of antibiotic resistance selective markers. Such markers are critical for isolation of B. burgdorferi strains with multiple mutants, for complementation with different cloning vectors, and for methods such as negative selection and reporter genes. To remedy this lack, resistance to various antibiotics of non-infectious (B31, 297) and infectious (N40) B. burgdorferi strains was examined and vectors incorporating appropriate antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers were developed. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for growth of B. burgdorferi on plates and in liquid media for aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamycin, sisomycin, amikacin, spectinomycin, neomycin), macrolides-lincosamids (erythromycin, lincomycin), coumarin derivatives (coumermycin A(1), novobiocin), glycopeptides (vancomycin, ristocetin), peptides (bacitracin, cycloserine), and chloramphenicol were found to differ significantly. There were also striking differences in resistance to these antibiotics between non-infectious and infectious B. burgdorferi strains. Antibiotic-resistance genes aph(3')-IIIa from Streptococcus faecalis, aad9 from Staphylococcus aureus Tn554, linA' from Staphylococcus aureus, and aac(3)-VIa from Enterobacter cloacae (conferring resistance to kanamycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin, and gentamycin/sisomycin, respectively) were subcloned either with their own promoters or under the control of the B. burgdorferi flaB promoter into pGK12 or its derivative pED1 to develop new cloning vectors for B. burgdorferi with the rationale that the absence of homologous regions between derived recombinant plasmids lacking the flaB promoter and the B. burgdorferi genome would permit avoidance of possible recombination with target DNA. Resistance to the corresponding antibiotic was conferred by vectors containing aph(3')-IIIa, aad9, linA' or aac(3)-VIa whether under the control of their own promoters or under the control of the flaB promoter. We conclude that these markers can be used for genetic study of B. burgdorferi and suggest they will be an important addition to the previously used coumermycin A(1), erythromycin and kanamycin in these studies.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - pKa, MM, and QM studies of mechanisms of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins: acylation step.
AB  - The acylation step of the catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) has been studied with various approaches. The methods applied range from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to multiple titration calculations using the Poisson-Boltzmann approach to quantum mechanical (QM) methods. The mechanism of class A beta-lactamases was investigated in the greatest detail. Most approaches support the critical role of Glu-166 and hydrolytic water in the acylation step of the enzymatic catalysis in class A beta-lactamases. The details of the catalytic mechanism have been revealed by the QM approach, which clearly pointed out the critical role of Glu-166 acting as a general base in the acylation step with preferred substrates. Lys-73 shuffles a proton abstracted by Glu-166 O(epsilon ) to the beta-lactam nitrogen through Ser-130 hydroxyl. This proton is transferred from O(gamma) of the catalytic Ser-70 through the bridging hydrolytic water to Glu-166 O(epsilon ). Then the hydrogen is simultaneously passed through S(N)2 inversion mechanism at Lys-73 N(zeta) to Ser-130 O(gamma), which loses its proton to the beta-lactam nitrogen. The protonation of beta-lactam nitrogen proceeds with an immediate ring opening and collapse of the first tetrahedral species into an acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the studies that considered the effect of solvation lower the barrier for the pathway, which utilizes Lys-73 as a general base, thus creating a possibility of multiple mechanisms for the acylation step in the class A beta-lactamases. These findings help explain the exceptional efficiency of these enzymes. They emphasize an important role of Glu-166, Lys-73, and Ser-130 for enzymatic catalysis and shed light on details of the acylation step of class A beta-lactamase mechanism. The acylation step for class C beta-lactamases and six classes of PBPs were also considered with continuum solvent models and MD simulations.
TI  - Preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  - Membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. They act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. Here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long) and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. All the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microM) and high antimicrobial activity. Hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. In contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. BIAcore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)/egg spingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol) vesicles. All the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (E. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG)) vesicles regardless of their length. In contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both PC/SM/cholesterol and PE/PG membranes. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of PC/cholesterol. The correlation between the antibacterial activity and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of E. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. The data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods. RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.
TI  - Colonization of denture plaque by respiratory pathogens in dependent elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the interactions between oral conditions and a number of prevalent systemic diseases. The morbidity and mortality of the dependent elderly that result from aspiration pneumonia have been recognized as a major geriatric health problem. The purpose of this study was to gain more information on the microflora of plaque on dentures and to assess the existence of oral infectious pathogens potentially causing the respiratory disease in the dependent elderly. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The denture bacterial flora of 50 dependent elderly were examined to identify microorganisms by the culture method. RESULTS: 18 species of microorganisms were detected in denture plaque in this study. A variety of pathogens with the potential to cause respiratory infection pathogens colonized on the dentures of dependent elderly. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study revealed that bacteria that commonly cause respiratory infection colonized on the dentures of dependent elderly, suggesting that denture plaque may function as a reservoir of potential respiratory pathogens to facilitate colonization on the oropharynx.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - Pyoderma faciale: gram-negative recovery by means of needle aspiration.
AB  - Pyoderma faciale is an inflammatory disease that until now was believed to occur  only in women. Bacterial pathogens have not been found in most cases, and those found included only gram-positive microorganisms. We present 2 cases consistent with pyoderma faciale--one of them a 17-year-old adolescent boy--in which gram-negative bacteria were found. Enterobacter cloacae was found in one patient, and Klebsiella oxytoca was found in the other. Needle aspiration is the technique of choice in looking for pathogens in this disease.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Synthesis of new C-6 alkyliden penicillin derivatives as beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - New penicillin, penicillin sulfone and sulfoxide derivatives bearing a C-6-alkyliden substituent were prepared. Their chemical synthesis, in vitro antibacterial activity and inhibition properties against two selected enzymes representing Class A and C beta-lactamases are reported. Compounds 3a-c, 7a-c were able to inhibit either TEM-1 (a Class A enzyme, from Escherichia coli) or P-99 (a Class C enzyme, from E. cloacae), or both enzymes, when tested in competition experiments using nitrocefin as the reporter substrate. However, when tested in combination with amoxicillin, the same compounds did not show synergistic effects against E. coli and E. cloacae strains producing TEM-1 and P99 enzymes, respectively. This finding is most likely related to poor penetration through the bacterial cell wall, as shown by using a more permeable isogenic E. coli strain. Interestingly, a synergistic effect against a strain of S. aureus which produces PC1-enzyme (a Class A beta-lactamase) was observed for compound 3a when used in combination with amoxicillin.
TI  - Jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. Previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. Our goal was to determine the incidence of UTIs in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with UTIs. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old for evidence of a UTI (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). A serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. Detailed questionnaires were completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. RESULTS: Twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a UTI (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). Isolated organisms included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of UTI, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. Abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a UTI, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. CONCLUSION: A UTI was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. In addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a UTI. Therefore, we recommend that testing for a UTI be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting to the emergency department.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics in vivo and pharmacodynamics ex vivo/in vitro of meropenem and cefpirome in the Yucatan micropig model: continuous infusion versus intermittent injection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacodynamic disposition of two recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics, meropenem and cefpirome, in the Yucatan micropig model, and to compare the bactericidal activity of these drugs against bacteria in this in vitro/ex vivo micropig model after administration by both intermittent injection and continuous infusion. METHODS: Cefpirome (1 g) was given to the micropig over a 12-h period by direct intravenous injection and 6-h continuous infusion (500 mg). Meropenem (250 mg) was administered either by 30-min intravenous and 8-h continuous infusion. The two drugs were assayed by HPLC. The pharmacodynamics of these drugs were evaluated by means of (1) serum killing curve against Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, stably derepressed Enterobacter cloacae and methicillin-susceptible penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and (2) calculations of index of surviving bacteria (ISB). RESULTS: The bactericidal activity of meropenem against K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae in this in vitro/ex vivo model was excellent, with a 4 log decrease at peak concentrations. Meropenem produced a mixed concentration- and time-dependent, killing effect against E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. The ISB value ranged from 25% to 30% for E. cloacae. With concentrations above MIC for S. aureus (1 mg/L), cefpirome has a time-dependent bactericidal activity, as shown by the ISB ranging from 20% to 80% after 4 h and between 20% and 40% after an 8-h drug exposure. For both antibiotics, the higher concentrations obtained just after intermittent injection had a rapid and strong killing effect against the strains tested, but the trough levels had no bactericidal activity. The continuous infusions produce consistent concentrations of antibiotic that can be maintained above the MIC, and the bactericidal activity of which ranges from 2 to 4 log10 decrease of inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study the micropig has been shown to be an adequate model for the pharmacodynamic investigation of cefpirome and meropenem. In general, continuous infusion appears to optimize the pharmacodynamic profile of the two tested beta-lactam antibiotics. However, against Gram-negative bacilli, the administration of a loading dose prior to continuous infusion of beta-lactams would eliminate the only potential pharmacokinetic disadvantage of continuous infusion and ensure the rapid onset of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in Italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and of  Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the Italian Epidemiological Observatory survey sponsored by the Smith-Kline Foundation. A standardised method was used to determine the MICs of 22 antibiotics against isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), Escherichia coli (n=684), Enterobacter cloacae (n=342), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and Serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the MICs of 11 antibiotics against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). Overall, the susceptibility rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). During the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in Klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in Escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in Enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in Serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. In contrast, Enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Of the total number of Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. Nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). Rates of susceptibility of particular species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains from different geographical areas of Italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [ICU] inpatients, non-ICU inpatients). Susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern Italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central Italy. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. No significant differences in susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to ICU and non-ICU units. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in ICU inpatients (52%) than in non-ICU inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.
TI  - Clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a Veterans Affairs medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. Thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. OBJECTIVE: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, was I site in a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult patients with SSTI. METHODS: Over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial SSTI requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg IV every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours. After a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg PO every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg PO every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. RESULTS: The center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but I of whom were male, reflecting the typical VA medical center population. The mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65 years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (P = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. Sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. The mean ( +/- SD) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/- 10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. Fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. The piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. The clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated SSTIs. Appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. Further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, Xenopus tropicalis (Pipidae).
AB  - Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.
TI  - Development of a Brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and PCR which distinguishes B. suis from Brucella abortus.
AB  - A genomic library was prepared from Brucella suis DNA (MboI digested) and cloned  into the BamHI site of pUC18. Colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified B. suis DNA labelled with alpha 32P was carried out to identify colonies of interest. About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of the high degree of DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. Of seven fragments selected to probe whole B. suis, B. abortus, and Yersinia enterocolitica DNA, one was found to hybridise with B. suis only. The probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. After optimisation of the PCR, a product of 420bp was obtained with B. suis template DNA and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with B. abortus template DNA. This is the first reported PCR of the Brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between B. suis and B. abortus. No band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, or Serratia marcescens template DNA.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - [The change in bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of bacteria of burn patients in our hospital during 1986-1996].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this article we investigated and analyzed the pathogenetic bacteria of burn infection and their drug resistance in recent 5 years from 1991. METHODS: The patients are divided into 2 groups. The 1st group is from June 1986 to May 1991, and the 2nd group is from June 1991 to June 1996. Blood culture and burn wound bacteria culture were done, and bacteria and their drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: In blood culture, Micrococcus had risen to rank the top (21.6%), while Staphylococcus aureus fell to rank the third. Among these G+ cocci comprised 56.5%, and G- bacilli 30.1%. In burn wound culture, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with rate of 18.1% was still in the 1st place. Enterobacter cloacae was in the 2nd place with the rate of 13.1%. Among these G- bacilli comprised 58.6%, G+ cocci 35.3%. Micrococcus enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas maltophilia, fecal Staphylococcus and candida albicans increased remarkably. CONCLUSION: The changes of pathogenetic bacteria of burn infection and bacteria drug resistance have certain relations with the wide usage of broad spectrum antibiotics such as cefazidime and imipenem.
TI  - The efficacy of chemical agents in cleaning and disinfection programs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the growing number of outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries, it becomes essential to set up a sanitation program that indicates that the appropriate chemical agent was chosen for application in the most effective way. METHOD: For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of a chemical agent, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was reached by the classic method of successive broth dilutions. The reference bacteria utilized were Bacillus subtilis var. globigii ATCC 9372, Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The strains of Enterobacter cloacae IAL 1976 (Adolfo Lutz Institute), Serratia marcescens IAL 1478 and Acinetobactev calcoaceticus IAL 124 (ATCC 19606), were isolated from material collected from babies involved in outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries. RESULTS: The MIC intervals, which reduced bacteria populations over 08 log10, were: 59 to 156 mg/L of quaternarium ammonium compounds (QACs); 63 to 10000 mg/L of chlorhexidine digluconate; 1375 to 3250 mg/L of glutaraldehyde; 39 to 246 mg/L of formaldehyde; 43750 to 87500 mg/L of isopropanol or ethanol; 1250 to 6250 mg/L of iodine in polyvinyl-pyrolidone complexes, 150 to 4491 mg/L of chlorine-releasing-agents (CRAs); 469 to 2500 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide; and, 2310 to 18500 mg/L of peracetic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine showed non inhibitory activity over germinating spores. A. calcoaceticus, was observed to show resistance to the majority of the agents tested, followed by E. cloacae and S. marcescens.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of aquacultured freshwater fish portions in prepackaged trays stored at 3 degrees C.
AB  - Fresh trout fillets and salmon slices packed in trays were obtained from two multinational chain supermarkets and evaluated for freshness and bacteriological quality immediately after packaging and during storage at 3 degrees C. Initial aerobic counts at 30 and 25 degrees C were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in trout fillets (5.27 +/- 0.57 and 4.87 +/- 0.80 log CFU/g, respectively) than in salmon slices, where levels in excess of 6 log CFU/g were found. In both products, initial Enterobacteriaceae counts were slightly higher than 3 log CFU/g and increased significantly during shelf life by approximately 3 log CFU/g. Most of the enterobacteria were identified as Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, and Enterobacter cloacae. On day 0, most probable number (MPN) counts of total and fecal coliforms were not significantly different, numbers of the latter group being approximately 4 MPN/g. Escherichia coli was only detected when fish was spoiled. Although initial presumptive Staphylococcus aureus counts were approximately 3 log CFU/g, only 4 of 84 selected colonies belonged to this species. Neither Salmonella nor antimicrobial residues were detected in any sample. Ethanol content in salmon slices did not significantly (P > 0.05) increase until they became inedible. Significant correlation (r = +0.72, P < 0.05) was observed between this chemical index and viable counts at 30 degrees C only when salmon slices were inedible. Trout fillets were acceptable for 7 days, and salmon slices showed signs of spoilage after 4 days. Although public health concerns associated with packed trout and salmon appear to be minimal, data on sensory quality, shelf life, and total viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts strongly suggest the need to improve the quality control systems used by European multinational retailers, especially for imported salmon.
TI  - Samioside, a new phenylethanoid glycoside with free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities from Phlomis samia.
AB  - A new phenylethanoid glycoside, samioside, was isolated from the aerial parts of  Phlomis samia and identified as 1-O-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4-O-caffeoyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside (1). In addition, one known phenylethanoid glycoside and three known flavonoids were identified as acteoside (2), apigenin, chrysoeriol, and ermanin, respectively. The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of its spectroscopic data. Samioside (1) demonstrated scavenging properties toward the DPPH radical and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Reduction in colonization and nosocomial infection by multiresistant bacteria in  a neonatal unit after institution of educational measures and restriction in the use of cephalosporins.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins predisposes to colonization and infections by multiresistant Enterobacter sp. The emergence of multiresistant bacteria infections in a neonatal unit during 1995, especially Enterobacter cloacae, stimulated this study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of measures to control colonization and nosocomial infection by multiresistant bacteria in a neonatal unit. SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from October 1995 through December 1999 in 4 phases: a cross-sectional study, a longitudinal study with intervention measures, monthly cross-sectional studies, and determination of nosocomial infections caused by multiresistant bacteria (oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria resistant to either aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins). Specimens for surveillance culture were obtained through umbilical and rectal swabs, and tracheal aspirates from intubated babies. The intervention measures were as follows: (1) appropriated training of the whole health care team, emphasizing measures to reduce cross-colonization, and the importance of rational usage of antibiotics and (2) suppression of usage of third-generation cephalosporins. Risk factors were analyzed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In the first phase, 32% (10/31) of the patients were colonized by multiresistant bacteria (29% by multiresistant E cloacae ). In the second phase, 342 patients were evaluated; 33% of them were colonized by E cloacae, and a multiresistant strain was isolated in 10.8% (37/342) of the babies. A logistic regression model indicated parenteral nutrition and antibiotic usage as risk factors for colonization by multiresistant E cloacae. In the third phase, for 6 months, only 2 patients were colonized by multiresistant E cloacae. In the fourth phase, the analysis of bacterial resistance profile indicated a reduction of nosocomial infections due to multiresistant bacteria from 18 cases in 1995 to 2 cases per year until 1999. CONCLUSION: These results have shown that the measures adopted were effective.
TI  - H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  - In an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. Most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed MRSA, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans were resistant. The activity was induced only by H(2)O(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. The mean concentration of H(2)O(2) produced by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microL of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. Viridans group streptococci inhibited MRSA growth in saliva as well as in culture media. These results indicate that H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit MRSA colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Phenotypic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus, selected Enterobacteriaceae, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa after single and multiple in vitro exposures to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  - The phenotypic resistance of selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin was defined as a MIC of > or =4 microg/ml. The dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. After a single 48-h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial MIC for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of MSSA was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (P = 0.008); for E. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for S. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (P = 0.003). The results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the Kaplan-Meier product-limited method as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. By both methods, MSSA and MRSA expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. For the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two general patterns emerged. Mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and reached higher mean MICs than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean MICs lower than the MICs of the other two drugs studied. Even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean MICs were reproduced when the serial passage experiment was repeated using an identical panel of E. coli isolates. In summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro.
TI  - The in vitro activity of sulbactam combined with third generation cephalosporins  against third generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam combined with cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime in the ratio of 1:1 was studied against ceftazidime- or cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus. Sulbactam enhanced the antibacterial activities of cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Gram-negative rods. The MIC(90) of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced 4-fold and that of cefotaxime against E. coli, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Acinetobacter spp. reduced by 2-4-fold. However, sulbactam did not enhance the activities of cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime against S. aureus, enterococci and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the combination of sulbactam and ceftazidime at the ratio of 1:1, 38.4% of E. coli, 45.3% of E. cloacae, 66.6% of C. freundii and 60% of Acinetobacter spp. initially resistant to ceftazidime became susceptible.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin.
AB  - Holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic lacked activity against the eukaryotic microorganisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida kefyr. Holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against Escherichia coli that was associated with rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis in whole cells. Inhibition of RNA synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting tRNA aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. However, the levels of inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed pair of E. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the relA gene. This suggests that inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Examination of the effects of holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced E. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of RNA polymerase at the level of RNA chain elongation. However, holomycin only weakly inhibited E. coli RNA polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(dA-dT) and plasmid templates. Furthermore, inhibition of RNA polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of E. coli. It is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits RNA polymerase.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Distribution and antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in the interstitial fluid of human soft tissues.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic which is established as therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. In addition, preliminary data indicate that fosfomycin has a potential role in the treatment of soft tissue infections. However, the use of fosfomycin has not been established for this condition, and it is unclear whether the level of fosfomycin penetration into human soft tissues is high enough to eradicate relevant pathogens. To better characterize the antibiotic potential of fosfomycin, we applied a combined in vivo pharmacokinetic-in vitro pharmacodynamic model to human volunteers. For this purpose fosfomycin concentrations in vivo in the fluid of the interstitial space of human soft tissues were measured by microdialysis following intravenous infusion of 4 or 8 g of fosfomycin (n = 6). Subsequently, bacterial isolates with relevance for soft tissue infections were exposed to concentrations according to the in vivo pharmacokinetic profile in the interstitial space fluid obtained by microdialysis. Our experiments indicated a high degree of soft tissue penetration for fosfomycin, with ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h for muscle (AUC(0-8(muscle)))/AUC(0-8(serum)) of 0.48+/-0.08 and 0.53+/-0.04 and ratios of AUC(0-8(adipose tissue))/AUC(0-8(serum)) of 0.74+/-0.12 and 0.71+/-0.11 following administration of 4 and 8 g, respectively. In corresponding in vitro simulation experiments with selected isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens for which MICs were 16 microg/ml, organisms were undetectable after a single dosing interval. Fosfomycin exhibits a strong ability to penetrate into the fluid of the interstitial space of soft tissues and reaches levels sufficient to substantially inhibit the growth of relevant bacteria at the target site. We therefore conclude that fosfomycin might qualify as an alternative candidate for the therapy of soft tissue infections.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological quality and wash treatments of lettuce served in University restaurants.
AB  - One hundred and forty-four samples of lettuce from 16 University restaurants were analyzed. The mesophilic aerobic counts of all samples ranged from 3.01 to 7.81 log10 CFU g(-1). Results of total coliforms ranged from < 0.47 to > 3.38 log10 most probable number (MPN) g(-1). Of the lettuce samples, 25.7% harbored Escherichia coli, 22.9% Staphylococcus aureus and 84% group D streptococci. Similarly, 10.4% of the samples harbored Aeromonas hydrophila, 2.8% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coliforms such as 14.6% Citrobacter freundii, 8.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.2% Enterobacter cloacae and 1.4% Providencia spp. Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli O157:H7 were not detected. When sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate solutions were used in washing procedures, the aerobic microorganisms were reduced by more than two log units, and total coliforms by at least one log.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - The synthesis and evaluation of 3-substituted-7-(alkylidene)cephalosporin sulfones as beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - A series of 3-substituted-7-(alkylidene)cephaloporin sulfones were prepared and evaluated as inhibitors of representative class A and class C serine beta-lactamase. Appropriate substituents resulted in a 1000-fold improvement in the inhibition of the class A enzymes and a simultaneous 20-fold improvement in the inhibition of class C. These new compounds have achieved the goal of creating broad scale inhibitors in the cephalosporin series.
TI  - The synthesis and evaluation of 2-substituted-7-(alkylidene)cephalosporin sulfones as beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - A series of 2-substituted-7-(alkylidene)cephalosporin sulfones were prepared and  evaluated as beta-lactamase inhibitors. Compound 11c showed excellent activity as an inhibitor of the class C beta-lactamase derived from Enterobacter cloacae, strain P99.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units: prospective study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates contaminated with bacteria are a main source of transfusion-associated sepsis. Several studies have reported a very wide incidence (0-10%) of contamination. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 15.5 months, 3,458 platelet concentrates (PCs) were analysed. The plasma from the bag and the tube was homogenised. One-fifth of the tube contents were inoculated every day for five days in two tubes containing 2.5 mL of Tryptic soy broth. One tube was incubated at room temperature and the other at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The bacteria were identified by standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-five (0.72%) of 3,458 platelet bags were contaminated. Twenty-two bacteria (88%) were found in the platelet bags stored three days or more, of which 14 (56%) were Staphylococci coagulase negative, two Staphylococcus aureus, one alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus, four bacillus cereus, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Escherichia Coli and two Xanthomonas maltophilia. CONCLUSION: The incidence reported in this series is higher than that reported by most authors.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - The nose as bacterial reservoir: important differences between the vestibule and  cavity.
AB  - The difference between the spectra of potential bacterial pathogens (PBPs) in the nasal vestibule and cavity has not been taken into account in clinical studies. PURPOSE: Since one can anticipate different flora in different kinds of mucosae, the authors compared bacterial species in the vestibule with those of the cavity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A total of 534 healthy male clerical workers in a downtown Lucerne office building were examined with fractionated swabs. RESULTS: PBPs, notably Staphylococcus aureus, were found in 412 subjects and surprisingly, differences in flora of the two sites were noted in 130 of them: PBPs were observed in the vestibule and not in the cavity in 85 of the subjects, and in 45 of them, the reverse was true. CONCLUSION: The practical implications of these findings are considerable regarding infection control in patients at increased infection risk.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime administered by intermittent and continuous infusion.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime administered by intermittent and continuous infusion against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. BACKGROUND: Because beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent bactericidal activity and lack prolonged postantibiotic effects against many bacteria, the goal of therapy is to maintain serum drug concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the relevant pathogen over most of the dosing interval. Continuous infusion is a mode of drug administration that can provide serum drug concentrations continuously above the MIC for most bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled. Each received cefepime 2 g by intermittent bolus q12h and, on another day, was randomly assigned to receive 4 or 3 g administered by continuous infusion over 24 hours. RESULTS: For the intermittent regimen, the mean (+/- SD) pharmacokinetic findings were: maximum serum concentration, 112.9 +/- 21.1 microg/mL; minimum serum concentration, 1.3 +/- 0.5 microg/mL; and half-life, 2.6 +/- 0.4 hours. For the 3- and 4-g continuous infusion regimens, steady-state serum concentrations (C(SS)) were 13.9 +/- 3.8 and 20.3 +/- 3.3 microg/mL, respectively. MICs ranged from 2 to 4, 0.125 to 8, and 2 to 8 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and S. aureus, respectively. For the intermittent regimen, serum inhibitory titers (SITs) at 24 hours were > or = 1:2 in 46% of subjects against P. aeruginosa, 48% against E. cloacae, and 2% against S. aureus. For both continuous infusion regimens, SITs for each organism were > or = 1:2 in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The intermittent regimen maintained serum concentrations above the MIC for P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae in > or = 92% (11/12) of subjects for > or = 70% of the dosing interval, provided the MIC was < or = 4 microg/mL. Both continuous infusion regimens provided a C(SS) above the MIC for all organisms. However, the C(SS) was > or = 4 times the MIC only if the MIC was < or = 2 microg/mL. Only the 4-g regimen provided such concentrations against isolates with an MIC of 4 microg/mL, and neither regimen provided such concentrations when the MIC was 8 microg/mL. These findings should be applied in comparative clinical studies.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above MIC at different creatinine clearances.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (Clcr). INTERVENTIONS: Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at Clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. The MIC data for 90% of organisms (MIC90) were collected for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean MIC90 was calculated. The T>MIC was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean MIC90. A T>MIC of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except S. aureus (> or = 50%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (Clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (Clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus at every Clcr. Imipenem 0.5 g achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and S. aureus at every Clcr. However, imipenem T>MIC was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: S. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 90 ml/min), E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 80 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 100 ml/min), S. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), and E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 50-70 ml/min). Ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (Clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus only. At every dose and Clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable T>MIC for S. aureus but not for any Enterobacteriaceae at Clcr > 50 ml/minute. Piperacillin did not achieve desirable T>MIC for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a T>MIC of 70% or above for P. aeruginosa at any Clcr. CONCLUSION: At every Clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable T>MIC for more nosocomial pathogens than any other beta-lactam evaluated. Based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. However, when P. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - We report here the antibacterial activity of the new penem antibiotic Men 10700 against a total of 740 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, in comparison to imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Men 10700 has shown a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity, with a potent activity both against gram-positive species (with the exception of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) as indicated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) values < or =0.5 mg/l, and gram-negative species, with MIC(90) values generally < or =2 mg/l. Men 10700 was the most potent antibiotic against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis, while the overall spectrum of activity resembled that of imipenem; meropenem was more active against most gram-negative species. In comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, Men 10700 demonstrated superior activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis and some gram-negative species such as Morganella morganii, Serratia spp. and Enterobacter cloacae; moreover, in contrast to third-generation cephalosporins, Men 10700 showed moderate activity against Enterococcus spp. The activity of Men 10700 against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains) and some gram-negative strains selected for their resistance to cefotaxime (20 strains) was particularly interesting.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - In vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant Spanish clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. Isolates were selected when their MIC to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). The following strains were tested: 61 Escherichia coli, 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Proteus mirabilis, 21 Serratia marcescens, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 Staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. Of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. The percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for E. coli, 75% for K. pneumoniae, 71.4% for P. mirabilis, 28.6% for S. marcescens, 75% for E. cloacae, 33.3% for P. aeruginosa, 90.5% for S. aureus and 40% for Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. It was particularly active against S. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical centers in Japan. Japan Antimicrobial Resistance Study Group.
AB  - Numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. Although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. In 1997, a Japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [C/S], imipenem). The participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. Three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. The quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of MIC values within established QC limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). Only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. After the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [CoNS], Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteae, Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (MIC90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. Only 3.7 and 45.1% of S. aureus and CoNS were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. Among E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > C/S > piperacillin. Possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6% of these isolates. Isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteae, and Serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). Acinetobacters were inhibited best by C/S (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. P. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of MICs at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). Several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including S. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. Clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic clusters. Also a multi-resistant E. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. Evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 P. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an Ambler Class C enzyme inhibitor (BRL42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. These results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in Japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. The overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > C/S (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).
TI  - Pulmonary infiltrates in liver transplant recipients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A frequent dilemma is discerning the likelihood of pneumonia and the  need for empiric antibiotic therapy in liver transplant recipients with pulmonary infiltrates in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of consecutive liver transplant recipients developing pulmonary infiltrates in the ICU. RESULTS: Of 90 consecutive liver transplant patients in the ICU over a 3-year period, 44% (40) developed pulmonary infiltrates. The etiologies were pneumonia (38%, 15 of 40), pulmonary edema (40%, 16 of 40), atelectasis (10%, 4 of 40), adult respiratory distress syndrome (8%, 3 of 40), contusion (3%, 1 of 40), and unknown (3%, 1 of 40). Pneumonia was due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 27% (4 of 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%, 4 of 15), invasive aspergillosis (20%, 3 of 15), and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and unknown (7%, 1 of 15) in one each. None of the patients had cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus pneumonia. Seventy-five percent of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and all Aspergillus pneumonias, but only 14% of the Gram-negative pneumonias, occurred within 30 days of transplantation. Twenty-seven percent of the pneumonias occurred >365 days after transplantation; all of these were in patients with recurrent viral hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, disseminated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or late rejection. Of patients with pneumonia, 87% were ventilated and 40% had bacteremia. Clinical pulmonary infection score (Pugin score) >6 (73% vs. 6%, P = 0.0001), abnormal temperature (73% versus 28%, P = 0.005), and creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (80% versus 50%, P = 0.05) were predictors of pneumonia versus other etiologies of pulmonary infiltrates. Overall mortality in patients with pulmonary infiltrates was 28% (11 of 40); pneumonia as etiology (P = 0.06), creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (P = 0.028), higher blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.017), and worse APACHE neurological score (P = 0.04) were predictors of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data have implications not only for identifying pneumonia as a potential cause of pulmonary infiltrates, but for the likely etiology of the pneumonia and thus the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy in critically ill liver transplant recipients. Pugin score >6 in patients with pulmonary infiltrates warrants antimicrobial therapy. Early onset within 30 days after transplantation raises the spectra of aspergillosis.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological approach.
AB  - Asymptomatic urinary tract infection is a risk factor for fetal and maternal morbidity including development of pyelonephritis, premature labor and impaired intra-uterine development. In this study, 326 pregnant and 100 non-pregnant control women were screened for significant asymptomatic bacteriuria from April 8 to July 25, 1997 to gain insight into the prevalence rate, clinical characteristics of the disease and microbiological assessments of the causative agents. All the subjects were clinically identified to have no signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). The age ranges of the study and control groups were between 15-40 years for both groups with mean of 25.1 and 25.3 years, respectively. Bacteriological screening of mid-stream urine (MSU) revealed that 24/326 (7%) and 3/100 (3%) were positive for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study group and controls, respectively (P < 0.05). Further biochemical species identification showed that Escherichia coli was found in 11/24 (46%) followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in 8/24 (33%) and Citrobacter freundii in 2/24 (8%). Others found in smaller number included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus rettgeri in 1/24 (4%) each. Antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that 10/11 (91%) of the E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin and 10/11 (91%) of them sensitive to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - In vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
AB  - A series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against Escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. In an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl THF side chains of the carbapenem molecules. The resulting peptidic prodrugs with L-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the D forms were less active than the parent molecules. After oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. Median effective doses (ED50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. Several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli infections, with ED50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ED50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. In general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. The parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.
TI  - Bacteriological monitoring in the Prague Burns Center.
AB  - The microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the Burn Center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. The Prague Burn Center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. Patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. Simultaneously, investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated. In all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. The typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. The most frequent isolate is S. aureus and the prevalence of MRSA is relatively high. Among gramnegative rods the strains of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae are most often isolated. Various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (E. agglomerans, S. marcescens, A. baumannii, etc.).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  - We describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (IE) in this retrospective review. Previously IE has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. The frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. Five patients survived. Microorganisms included gram positives such as S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram negatives such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. We conclude that IE may be more common than previously described. Prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. Prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of IE in high-risk neonates.
TI  - Bacteria causing septicaemia in neonates with tetanus.
AB  - 105 consecutively admitted neonates with tetanus were screened for sepsis to determine the prevalence of sepsis in neonatal Tetanus (NNT) patients and identify the bacterial pathogens causing septicaemia in them. The presence of omphalitis, poor colour, hypothermia and hyperthermia were found to be sensitive predictors of septicaemia in NNT patients. 50 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 50 babies. Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (19.0%) were the leading gram negatives, while staphylococcus aureus (19.2%) was the prevalent gram positive organism isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility profile heavily favours ofloxacin but a combination of cloxacillin and gentamicin is recommended as first line. Ceftazidime with about 60% susceptibility across board is the favoured cephalosporin.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. For nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (TNA), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. METHODS: We prospectively studied in a representative TNA (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; pH 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (D5%/W), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees C of three isolates each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium spp, and Candida albicans, and two isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate TNA during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. RESULTS: Growth in TNA at 25 and 35 degrees C occurred with only two species, C. albicans and S. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; D5%/W allowed growth at 25 degrees C of two gram-negative species, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that TNA is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than D5%/W. The need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with TNA should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - In vivo activity and pharmacokinetic evaluation of a novel long-acting carbapenem antibiotic, MK-826 (L-749,345).
AB  - MK-826 (formerly L-749,345), is a potent 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long half-life and broad spectrum of activity. This compound is presently in phase-II clinical trials. Its activity against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared to those of imipenem (IPM) and eight other beta-lactam agents in two in vivo murine infection models. The distribution in tissue and pharmacokinetic properties of MK-826 and ceftriaxone (CTRX) were also evaluated in CD-1 mice following a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg of body weight). In addition, concentrations in plasma as well as biliary and urinary recovery of MK-826 were compared to that of CTRX in a cannulated rat model. In a localized murine thigh infection model, MK-826 and IPM were superior to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics in reduction of Staphylococcus aureus CFU compared with results from nontreated controls (eliminating >/=4 log10 CFU). Similar activities of IPM and MK-826 were observed in a gram-positive bacterial murine systemic infection model. While IPM demonstrated greater efficacy than MK-826 against Enterobacter cloacae (50% effective doses [ED50s] of 0.062 and 0.227 mg/kg, respectively) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ED50s of 0.142 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively) systemic infections, MK-826 was 8- to 350-fold more efficacious than IPM against all other gram-negative organisms in this infection model. In mice, MK-826 demonstrated a higher peak concentration in serum (62.8 versus 42.6 microg/ml) and a larger area under the curve (AUC) (150.8 versus 90.0 microg . hr/ml) than CTRX. The concentrations of MK-826 and CTRX in serum declined slowly, with levels of 3.6 and 2.0 microg/ml remaining, respectively, at 6 h posttreatment. The rat pharmacokinetic model showed the average AUC of MK-826 to be greater than that of CTRX (284 versus 142 microg . hr/ml) following a single 10-mg/kg dose. Also, a half-life of MK-826 longer than that of CTRX (3.2 versus 2.3 h) was observed in this species. The total amount of drug excreted in the bile in 8 h was greater for CTRX (55 to 64% of the dose) than for MK-826 (6 to 12.5% of the dose). Urinary recovery was similar for both antibiotics, with 16 to 18% of the dose recovered over an 8-h period. This excellent broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy of MK-826, together with advantageous pharmacokinetics, supports the argument for its further clinical development.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. METHODOLOGY: The study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged 21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. In all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. Microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. Duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12) and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). RESULTS: Complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40 (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. Mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. A variety of organisms were cultured from pancreatic fluid, E. coli being the most prevalent. Enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. Cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. The level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - Reconstituted recombinant factor VIII can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  - Reconstituted recombinant factor VIII (FVIIIrec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less FVIIIrec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. However, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a concern with continuous infusion. We studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees C in reconstituted FVIIIrec (Kogenate) and at 25 degrees C in 5% dextrose in water (D5%W) of three isolates each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium spp. and Candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. Reconstituted FVIIIrec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C: S. marcescens, S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. D5%W allowed growth of two gram-negative species, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. We conclude that reconstituted FVIIIrec (Kogenate) is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with D5%W. If reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted FVIIIrec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  - The decision regarding the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies must be individualized in each institution, by taking into account variations in the patterns of microbial isolates and their resistance profiles. Microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns must be taken into account at each hospital. A shift from bacteremia due to infections caused by predominantly gram-negative organisms to predominantly gram-positive organisms in patients with hematologic malignancies has been noted in reports from other countries. We investigated bacterial isolates and their antibiotic sensitivities in patients with hematologic malignancies in the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. A total of 185 episodes of bacteremia in 140 patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded during the period from 1995 to 1996. Unlike foreign reports, our investigation shows that gram-negative organisms still predominate, accounting for 72.7% of isolates, followed by gram-positive organisms, accounting for 26.3% of isolates, and anaerobes, accounting for 1% of isolates. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism, accounting for 23.9% of isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.3%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). A high mortality rate was observed in gram-negative bacteremia: 31% for E. coli, 26% for K. pneumoniae, 24% for P. aeruginosa, and 33% for E. cloacae. If methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia occurred, mortality was high (47%). The antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the four most common gram-negative isolates (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and E. cloacae) indicated that, in our hospital, amikacin with either cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or imipenem, would be an ideal combination for empirical therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - [The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran against clinically isolated bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran (CZOP) against recent clinical  isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ceftazidime (CAZ), cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), cefotaxime (CTX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (S/C), imipenem (IPM), oxacillin (MPIPC), and flomoxef (FMOX). MIC80 values of CZOP for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 41), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 57), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 45), Enterococus faecalis (n = 49), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 50), Citrobacter freundii (n = 45), Serratia marcescens (n = 45), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) were 1, 32, 2, 16, 4, 1, 0.25, 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. CZOP was more active than CPR against P. aeruginosa and exhibited similar activity to CPR against other species. CZOP was especially active against S. marcescens with MIC values lower than 1 microgram/ml against all strains tested. CZOP was similarly active to or more active than CFPM against all species except for C. freundii. CZOP was not active against MRSA. Thus, we investigated the in vitro combination effects of CZOP/vancomycin (VCM) and CZOP/arbekacin (ABK) using the checkerboard method. The interaction between CZOP and VCM ranged from additive activity (0.5 < FIC index < or = 1.00, n = 37) to synergistic activity (FIC index < 0.50, n = 1), except for one strain showing indifference (1.00 < FIC index < or = 2.00). The interaction between CZOP and ABK ranged from additive activity (n = 22) to synergistic activity (n = 1). These date suggest the potential effect of combination therapy of (CZOP) and VCM or ABK against MRSA. The combined therapy is suggested to be useful to reduce side effects in patients with impared renal function, to reduce the administration dose of VCM or to treat infections of sites where achievable drug concentrations are lower than those commonly achieved in the bloodstream. We also investigated the combination effects of CZOP/AMK and CZOP/GM against CZOP-resistant P. aeruginosa (MIC > 16 micrograms/ml). The combination of CZOP/AMK showed additive activity (n = 9) to synergistic activity (n = 2). The combination of CZOP/GM showed additive activity (n = 5). These results suggest that combinations of CZOP with AMK or GM are effective in treating P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Transtorine, a new quinoline alkaloid from Ephedra transitoria.
AB  - Transtorine (1), a new quinoline alkaloid, isolated from the aerial part of Ephedra transitoria by column chromatography, was identified as 4-quinolone-2-carboxylic acid. The structure was determined by spectroscopic methods. Transtorine exhibited growth inhibitory activity against the common bacteria, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of Cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Incidence and epidemiology of nosocomial infections in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - In a prospective study, we investigated the incidence, characteristics, and risk  factors of nosocomial infections (NIs) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus disease. There was a total of 528 admissions of 405 eligible patients; 46 NIs (8.7% per discharge) were identified in 39 patients. The proportional frequencies of NIs were as follows: 16 skin and/or soft-tissue infections (including localized catheter-associated infections), 3.0%; 14 respiratory tract infections, 2.7%; 11 bloodstream infections, 2.1%; and 5 urinary tract infections, 0.9%. The most common etiologic agents were Staphylococcus aureus (27.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%), and Enterobacter cloacae (13.8%). The duration of hospitalization was not significantly prolonged by NI in the cohort.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

AB  
TI  - The human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells (M. F. Bernet, D. Brassard, J. R. Neeser, and A. L. Servin, Gut 35:483-489, 1994). Here, we demonstrate that strain LA1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by Salmonella typhimurium. We present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain LA1 (LA1-SCS) contained antibacterial components active against S. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. By contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
TI  - Microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. The bacteria tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three fungal species also were tested: Aspergillus fumigatus, Paecilomyces variotii, and Candida albicans. In the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. In the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. They were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. None of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. In contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. Samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. Of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. In most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. In only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. The data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for extended periods of time.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - The photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD-Arg(2)) on the growth of selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD). Growth inhibition of HpD-Arg(2) of three Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. Serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated HpD-Arg(2) or HpD. The antimicrobial activity of light-activated HpD-Arg(2) against P. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients and outpatients in the United States: increasing importance of the intensive care unit.
AB  - To compare the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals with that in the community, we analyzed data for isolates collected from inpatients and outpatients in eight U.S. hospitals. The percentage of resistant isolates from inpatients was higher than that from outpatients for the following combinations of antimicrobials and organisms: methicillin/coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (49.0% vs. 36.0%, respectively; P < .01); methicillin/Staphylococcus aureus (33.0% vs. 14.5%, respectively; P < .01); ceftazidime/Enterobacter cloacae (26.0% vs. 12.0%, respectively; P < .01); imipenem/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.0% vs. 6.5%, respectively; P < .01); ceftazidime/P. aeruginosa (7.8% vs. 4.0%, respectively; P < .01); and vancomycin/Enterococcus species (6.3% vs. 1.4%, respectively; P < .01). There was a significant stepwise decrease in the percentage of resistant organisms isolated from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU inpatients, and outpatients. These results suggest that resources allocated to control antimicrobial resistance should continue to be focused in the hospital, particularly in the ICU.
TI  - Bacterial strains isolated from eggs and their resistance to currently used antibiotics: is there a health hazard for consumers?
AB  - In order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. were the most frequently isolated genera. Sensitivity tests, performed with the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-G, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins, oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), Enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), Escherichia coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), Enterobacter cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), Pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and Citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution PASCO MIC panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  - The stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in PASCO (PASCO System, DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C was evaluated. The increase in MIC values for the five American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. The overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the MIC values of PASCO frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method was 97.7%. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees C. In contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. At -20 degrees C, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with ATCC strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. Cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C. Strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during the storage period.
TI  - Low prevalence of gastrointestinal colonization with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in high risk units in a Canadian tertiary care centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria among  patients receiving care in high risk units in a Canadian tertiary care centre. DESIGN: Prevalence study over a four-month period in 1995 with rectal swab or freshly passed stool specimen collected from each patient included in study. Standardized record data extraction for selected patient variables was used. SETTING: Units at high risk for antimicrobial-resistant organisms at the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, including neonatal (NICU), pediatric (PICU), surgical (SICU) and medical intensive care units (MICU), central dialysis unit (CDU), and the in-patient oncology ward (ONC). PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients admitted to the high risk care units for at least 72 h were screened. Ward distribution was NICU 13 (8.3%), PICU nine (5.7%), SICU 24 (15.3%), MICU 19 (12.1%), CDU 62 (39.5%) and ONC 30 (19.1%). Fifty-one of 157 (32.5%) patients had urinary drainage devices, 108 (68.8%) had invasive vascular devices, and 57 (36.3%) had had a surgical procedure within the month before specimen collection. In the month before sampling, 114 (72.6%) had received antimicrobial therapy, including 21 (13.3%) who had received vancomycin, and 81 (51.5%) were receiving antimicrobials, seven (10.8%) vancomycin, on the day of sampling. RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were performed on 371 bacterial isolates. There were no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven (10.8%) enterococci were resistant to ampicillin, none of which were beta-lactamase producers, 19 (18.6%) and five (4.9%) demonstrated high level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. One (0.7%) Escherichia coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin and another to gentamicin. Six (20.7%) Enterobacter cloacae samples were resistant to cefotaxime. One (2.4%) Klebsiella species was resistant to ciprofloxacin and another to cefotaxime. Two (16.6%) Citrobacter species were resistant to cefotaxime. One of 11 (9%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was resistant to ceftazidime; none were resistant to piperacillin, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin or imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract in patients in these high risk units is low. The reasons for this low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance require further exploration.
TI  - [Simultaneous isolation of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a novel selective and differential PMAC agar].
AB  - PMAC agar, a novel, selective and differential medium has been developed and was  subjected for evaluation of its selective and differential capability of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from other bacteria such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, Gram-negative bacteria and drug resistant ones. Growth of MRSA and P. aeruginosa on PMAC agar was facilitated and their colonies were easily differentiated. Colonies of MRSA after 24 approximately 48 h incubation at 35 degrees C were small (2 to 4 mm in diameter), smooth and egg-yolk reaction positive. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa with pigment production (pyocianin, fluorescin or pyomelanin) formed large (2.5 to 7.0 mm in diameter), brownish black or brown colonies with a creamy edge. PMAC agar did not allow to grow unwanted bacteria tested except certain species formerly classified to Pseudomonas such as Burkholderia and Stenotrophomonas. However multi-drug resistant strains such as Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus formed extremely small colonies. PMAC agar is recommended as a novel, useful medium for isolation, differentiation and presumptive identification of MRSA and P. aeruginosa from clinical and environmental sources.
TI  - Comparison of three different in vitro methods of detecting synergy: time-kill, checkerboard, and E test.
AB  - An in vitro method of detecting synergy which is simple to perform, accurate, and reproducible and has the potential for clinical extrapolation is desirable. Time-kill and checkerboard methods are the most widely used techniques to assess synergy but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. The Epsilometer test (E test), a less technically demanding test, has not been well studied for synergy testing. We performed synergy testing of Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 23355, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 with various combinations of cefepime or ceftazidime with tobramycin or ciprofloxacin using time-kill, checkerboard, and E test techniques. Time-kill testing was performed against each organism alone and in combinations at one-fourth times the MIC (1/4 x MIC) and 2 x MIC. With checkerboard tests, the same combinations were studied at concentrations ranging from 1/32 x to 4 x MIC. Standard definitions for synergy, indifference, and antagonism were utilized. E test strips were crossed at a 90 degree angle so the scales met at the MIC of each drug alone, and the fractional inhibitory concentrations index was calculated on the basis of the resultant zone on inhibition. All antimicrobial combinations demonstrated some degree of synergy against the test organisms, and antagonism was infrequent. Agreement with time-kill testing ranged from 44 to 88% and 63 to 75% by the checkerboard and E test synergy methods, respectively. Despite each of these methods utilizing different conditions and endpoints, there was frequent agreement among the methods. Further comparisons of the E test synergy technique with the checkerboard and time-kill methods are warranted.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum pedunculatum used in circumcision rites.
AB  - Antibacterial assays of Helichrysum pedunculatum showed that dichloromethane extracts are active against all the gram positive bacteria tested, as well as two gram negative bacteria, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A water extract was effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus kristinae, while a methanol extract showed no activity against any of the tested organisms. The antibacterial activity of dichloromethane extract was also investigated by direct bioassay on TLC plates against S. aureus.
TI  - [Determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  - The determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. The methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. These beta-lactamases were obtained from Enterobacter cloacae P99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia M 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. The strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were S. aureus M 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and E. faecalis M 2113, E. avium M 2091 and S. aureus M 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), E. coli M 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. When rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, E. coli M 1495 turned out more adequate. E. coli M 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
TI  - Comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the United States, measured by two methods.
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the United States, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). A total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the Etest method (AB Biodisk) or a microdilution method (MicroScan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. The results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. This article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. Antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods--MicroScan and Etest--showed that most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce Bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter freundii). In addition, the activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. Most methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci were resistant. Overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. Categorically, the results from the microdilution and Etest methods were equivalent.
TI  - Evaluation of the use of Bactec anaerobic blood cultures in the detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children.
AB  - In an attempt to reduce costs, the role of Bactec anaerobic blood culture in the  detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children was evaluated. Results from 3167 sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures from children admitted to the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur during a one year period, were analysed. Four hundred and eight (12.9%) sets of blood cultures were positive, of which 348 sets (11.0%) from 201 patients were clinically significant. Of the 348 significant positive sets, organisms were isolated on 177 (50.9%) occasions from both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, on 136 (39.1%) occasions from the aerobic bottle only and 35 (10.0%) occasions from the anaerobic bottle only. No strict anaerobes were isolated, but clinically significant isolates recovered from the anaerobic bottle only included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella species, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus. Patients with bacteraemia diagnosed solely by anaerobic culture were distributed evenly across the various paediatric subspecialities. When results from the anaerobic bottles were excluded, the overall isolation rate was reduced from 11% to 9.9%. Potential financial savings resulting from omission of anaerobic cultures must be balanced against the small number of bacteraemic episodes that could be missed. Undiagnosed bacteraemia may result in increased morbidity and mortality with its own attendant financial implications.
TI  - [Current aspects of the fecal flora of the newborn without antibiotherapy during  the first 7 days of life: Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci].
AB  - Last years, il became obvious that the colonization pattern described in 1976-1978 was no more valid: early colonization by Enterobacteriaceae at the 2-3 rd day of life in all newborns, with constant presence of antibioresistant strainseven in non treated newborns. To establish the new pattern of colonization, the same quantitative method of dilution and culture on selective media was used daily from day 1 to day 7 (5 days only for M). The number of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci and staphylococci was determined in the stools of 10 newborns in the Maternity unit (= M) (term 40 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 3,356 g +/- 383), 10 in the Premature nursery (= P) (term 34.9 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 676), and 14 in the Neonatal intensive care unit (= R) (term 35.2 weeks +/- 3.8, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 763). The results establish that colonization by Enterobacteriaceae is no more constant at D3. It could be demonstrated only in 8/10 M, 1/10 P, and 6/14 R (statistically different - p < 0.01 - between M and P). At D5, 9/10 M, 5/10 P, 10/14 R, and at D7, 6/10 P and 10/14 R were colonized. Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae) could be found in only 3/10 M, 4/10 P and 6/14 R. Enterococci could be found in 1 newborn M, 2 P and 7 newborns R. Staphylococci appeared earlier: all newborns M, P and R were colonized at D2, 4 and 5 respectively. These bacteria were coagulase negative, associated with Staphylococcus aureus in 3 P. Our hypothesis is that late colonization with Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci is due to the improvement of hygiene procedures and due to the decontaminating effect of antibiotics in other treated newborns (Enterobacteriaceae by 3 rd generation cephalosporin and enterococci by pharyngeal vancomycin).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of sulopenem, a new parenteral penem antibiotic].
AB  - Sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic, was compared with other antibiotics with regard to in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activities, stabilization against beta-lactamases, and effect on the release of lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Sulopenem showed more potent activities than other antibiotics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2. Sulopenem showed potent bactericidal activities (MIC/MBC) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Time kill studies against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii showed potent bactericidal activities of sulopenem. 3. Sulopenem was found to possess a stronger activity than other antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains except P. aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 4. In particular, sulopenem was found to be more stable to the hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative bacteria than any other antibiotics tested. Vmax/Km values of sulopenem were smaller than those of cefotiam for all tested beta-lactamases, which reflected a broad antibacterial spectrum of sulopenem. 5. E. coli ML4707 exposed to sulopenem and imipenem released less endotoxin than did controls at all concentration ranges tested. In contrast, the strain exposed to ceftazidime at bacteriostatic concentrations released a large amount of endotoxin.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - Beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects on beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  - Beta-Secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the steady-state kinetic parameters V/K and V for turnover of a depsipeptide substrate, m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]-oxy]benzoic acid, and of a beta-lactam substrate, penicillanic acid, by three typical class A beta-lactamases and a class C beta-lactamase. The isotope effects on alkaline hydrolysis of these substrates have been used as a frame of reference. The effect of the transition state conformation of the substrates in determining the beta-secondary isotope effects has been explicitly considered. The inverse beta-secondary isotope effects on both V/K and V for the class A enzymes with both substrates indicate transition states where the carbonyl group of the scissile bond has become tetrahedral and therefore reflect typical acyl-transfer transition states. The solvent isotope effects indicate that enzyme deacylation (as reflected in V for the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase) may be a classical general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis but that there is little proton motion in the enzyme acylation transition state (as revealed by V/K) for the TEM beta-lactamase and Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I. These results provide kinetic support for the conjecture made on structural grounds that class A beta-lactamases employ an asymmetric double-displacement mechanism. The isotope effects on V/K for the class C beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 suggest an acyl-transfer transition state for the penicillin, although, as for the class A enzymes, without significant proton motion. On the other hand, the V/K transition state for depsipeptide does not seem to involve covalent chemistry. Suggestive of this conclusion are the measured beta-secondary isotope effect of 1,002 +/- 0.012 and the inverse solvent isotope effect. These results provide an example of a significant difference between the kinetics of turnover of a beta-lactam and a depsipeptide by a beta-lactamase. The V transition state for both substrates with the P99 beta-lactamase probably involves acyl-transfer (deacylation) where the conformation of the acyl-enzyme is closely restricted. The conformations of acyl-enzymes of the PC1 and P99 beta-lactamases correlate to the (different) dispositions of general base catalysts at their active sites.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of combination uses of isepamicin and beta-lactams in vitro against clinically isolated strains. Part 2. The results against enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of combination uses of isepamicin (ISP)  and beta-lactams in vitro against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. ISP+cefazolin, ISP+cefotiam and ISP+flomoxef against K. pneumoniae and ISP+piperacillin, ISP+ceftazidime, ISP+aztreonam, ISP+imipenem and ISP+panipenem against E. cloacae showed strong combined effects. 2. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these combinations were low due to the dependence of ISP concentrations. Strong antibacterial activities were observed at sub-MIC levels of ISP. These combined effects were stronger than those against Staphylococcus aureus described in the first report at sub-MIC levels of ISP. 1/4 MIC approximately 1/8 MIC of ISP showed enhanced activities of beta-lactams. Similarly strong combined effects were observed against both beta-lactam-sensitive and -resistant strains.
TI  - Visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries.
AB  - Visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. Four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. The patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. All the patients received operative treatment. Two of them died of sepsis. Injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. The data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three consecutive 5-year periods. Over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. Most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. Long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed no improvement in controlling the sepsis. After 1987, most of the microorganisms were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. The progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. The infections caused by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. A marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. A gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. Sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8 per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.
TI  - [Specificities of antibacterial activity of zwitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephems (cephalosporins of fourth generation].
AB  - Zwitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephalosporins possess a variable substitution at C3  which contains a quaternary nitrogen. These cephalosporins display low affinities for class I beta-lactamase and rapid penetration through the outer membrane of Gram negative bacilli. Hence, they remain active against some, but not all, ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Antipseudomonas activities are generally similar to that of ceftazidime except that cefelidin is more active. The new zwitterionic compounds express greater antistaphylococcal potency than does ceftazidime. On the basis of structural and antibacterial characteristics the expression "forth generation" is acceptable to describe the wzitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephalosporins.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms in dead mink kits from Aleutian-disease-infected and non-infected farms.
AB  - Bacterial and fungi were isolated from different tissues (brain, liver, heart) taken from 81 dead newborn mink originating from Aleutian disease (AD) infected and AD-non-infected farms. Of the 123 isolates obtained, 96% were bacterial isolates (predominantly Gram-negative) and 4% were fungi. The prevalence of microorganisms appeared less common in kits from AD-non-infected farms (55%) than from AD-infected farms (73%), although the difference was not significant. The liver was the most highly infected site in both groups and generally was only infected by one microorganism species. Proteus spp (23%), Escherichia coli (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (11%) and Enterobacter cloacae (9%) were the most frequently isolated germs. These findings are similar to those of other studies but the role of these microorganisms as specific pathogens or secondary invaders remains controversial.
TI  - Susceptibility of corneal and conjunctival pathogens to ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution has been shown to be effective in the treatment of bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis, and many physicians use ciprofloxacin as sole therapy in these conditions. In this retrospective study, we found seven of 84 isolates from corneal and conjunctival cultures that were resistant to ciprofloxacin. All of the resistant organisms were gram positive. Six of the isolates (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis, and four isolates of the Streptococcus viridans group) were from corneal cultures, and one (Staphylococcus aureus) was from a conjunctival culture. Yearly records of systemic isolates from 1988 to 1993 (n = 35,308) demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in susceptibility for several organisms that are common pathogens in the conjunctiva and cornea: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (95-90%, p = 0.001); Staphylococcus aureus (96-87%, p < 0.0001); Staphylococcus spp., coagulase negative (97-81%, p < 0.0001); Enterococcus spp. (92-79%, p < 0.0001); Acinetobacter anitratus (97-77%, p = 0.0006); and Enterobacter cloacae (100-96%, p = 0.03). Although the susceptibility of corneal and conjunctival isolates in this series remained relatively high (91.7%), a much larger series of systemic isolates that are common ocular pathogens revealed a statistically significant increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin over the preceding 5 years.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities and comparative pharmacokinetics of meropenem and imipenem-cilastatin.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) of imipenem and meropenem were investigated in a randomized crossover study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a constant 30-min infusion of either 1 g of imipenem plus 1 g of cilastatin or 1 g of meropenem. The concentrations of the drugs in serum and urine were determined by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were based on an open two-compartment model and a noncompartmental technique. At the end of infusion, the mean concentrations of imipenem and meropenem measured in serum were 61.2 +/- 9.8 and 51.6 +/- 6.5 mg/liter, respectively; urinary recoveries were 48.6% +/- 8.2% and 60.0% +/- 6.5% of the dose in 12 h, respectively; and the areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were 96.1 +/- 14.4 and 70.5 +/- 10.3 mg.h/liter, respectively (P < or = 0.02). Imipenem had a mean half-life of 66.7 +/- 10.4 min; that of meropenem was 64.4 +/- 6.9 min. The volumes of distribution at steady state of imipenem and meropenem were 15.3 +/- 3.3 and 18.6 +/- 3.0 liters/70 kg, respectively, and the mean renal clearances per 1.73 m2 were 85.6 +/- 17.6 and 144.6 +/- 26.0 ml/min, respectively. Both antibiotics were well tolerated in this single-dose administration study. The SBAs were measured by the microdilution method of Reller and Stratton (L. B. Reller and C. W. Stratton, J. Infect. Dis. 136:196-204, 1977) against 40 clinically isolated strains. Mean reciprocal bactericidal titers were measured 1 and 6 h after administration. After 1 and 6 h the median SBAs for imipenem and meropenem, were 409 and 34.9 and 97.9 and 5.8, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus, 19.9 and 4.4 and 19.4 and 4.8, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 34.3 and 2.2 and 232 and 15.5, respectively, against Enterobacter cloacae, and 13.4 and 2.25 and 90.7 and 7.9, respectively, against Proteus mirabilis. Both drugs had rather short biological elimination half-lives and a predominantly renal route of elimination. Both carbapenems revealed high SBAs against clinically important pathogens at 1 h; meropenem had a higher SBA against E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, and the SBA of imipenem against S. aureus was greater than the SBA of meropenem.
TI  - [Treatment of an exposed femorol-popliteal bypass: ex-situ replacement].
AB  - From December 1990 to July 1995 we performed 171 sub-inguinal revascularizations  including 35 popliteal revascularizations and 146 revascularizations of an artery in the leg or foot. Five cases of infection were observed within a delay of 7 and 25 days after the operation. There were 3 men and 2 women (mean age 78 years). Four femoro-tibial bypasses were made for critical ischaemia (2 necroses of the toes, one eschar of the heal, one stage III). There was one femoro-popliteal bypass which was associated with a femoro-femoral for necrosis of the toes. Two bypasses were made with polytetrafluoroethylene, one with Dacron and two with the greater saphenous vein. Signs of sepsis were bleeding in 2 patients who had a venous bypass and septicaemia in 2 patients. Local skin necrosis and/or apparently infected discharge or patent pus were seen in all patients. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 4 patients and Enterobacter cloacae in one. Revascularization was done with an extra-anatomic bypass in 4 patients and with a cryopreserved in situ allograft in 1. Mortality was 20% and amputation rate was 40%. All exposed bypasses were infected but the severity of the infection varied depending on the causal germ, general signs and ischaemia of the limb. Conservative treatment has its limits: 1) intact anastomoses, 2) absence of bleeding, 3) patent bypass, 4) absence of generalized sepsis. Results of in situ revascularization depend on the virulence of the causal germ. Radical treatment (explanation + extra-anatomic revascularization) still has indications in infected infra-inguinal bypass surgery.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of T-5575 and T-5578 novel parenteral 2-carboxypenams.
AB  - T-5575 and T-5578, novel 2-carboxypenams in which a carboxyl group has been introduced into the C-2 beta position of the nucleus, were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. The spectrum of activity of T-5575 was similar to that of aztreonam. However, it showed stronger activities than those of aztreonam against most gram-negative bacteria. T-5575 also showed potent activities against isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of 0.39, 0.39, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. T-5578 showed moderate levels of activity against gram-negative bacteria, compared with those of T-5575. Its activity against P. aeruginosa, however, was superior to those of T-5575 and the reference drugs tested. The most characteristic feature of T-5578 was its potent activities against ceftazidime-, imipenem-, and gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited at 0.39, 3.13, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. These two compounds were unfortunately poorly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. Both compounds were found to be stable for hydrolysis by various kinds of beta-lactamases and to have low affinities for these enzymes, with Ki values of > 100 microM. These novel penams bound most tightly to penicillin-binding protein 3 of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results indicate that T-5575 and T-5578 can be regarded as promising 2-carboxypenams specially targeted against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1.

TI  - Typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - We typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (PFGE). Isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were tested. Excluding E. cloacae, 28 of 32 sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related PFGE types. Four of the seven sets of E. cloacae showed different types. For species other than E. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. Unlike all of the other tested species, E. cloacae PFGE typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

AB  
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin alone and in combination against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The time-kill curve methodology was used to determine the pharmacodynamics of piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and the combinations piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam. Kill curve studies were performed for piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam at concentrations of 0.25 to 50 times the MICs for 13 strains of bacteria: four Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella pneumoniae, and three Staphylococcus aureus isolates (tazobactam concentrations of 0.5, 4, and 12 micrograms/ml). By using a sigmoid Emax model and nonlinear least squares regression, the 50% lethal concentrations and the maximum lethal rates of each agent were determined for each bacterial strain. For piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam, kill curve studies were performed with concentrations obtained by the fractional maximal effect method (R. C. Li, J. J. Schentag, and D. E. Nix, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37:523-531, 1993) and from individual 50% lethal concentrations and maximum lethal rates. Ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam was evaluated only against the four P. aeruginosa strains. Interactions between piperacillin and ciprofloxacin were generally additive. At physiologically relevant concentrations of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin had the highest rates of killing against K. pneumoniae. Piperacillin-tazobactam (12 micrograms/ml) had the highest rate of killing against E. cloacae. Piperacillin-ciprofloxacin with relatively higher ciprofloxacin concentrations had the greatest killing rates against S. aureus. This combination had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin (P < 0.002). For all the bacterial strains tested, killing rates by ciprofloxacin were significantly higher than those by piperacillin-tazobactam (4 and 12 micrograms/ml had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin alone (P < 0.02 and P < 0.004, respectively). The effect of the combination of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin, in which piperacillin concentrations were relatively higher, was not statistically different from that of piperacillin alone (p > or = 0.71). The combination of ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam achieved greater killing than other combinations or monotherapies against P. aeruginosa. The reduction in the initial inoculum was 1 to 4 logs greater with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam at 4 and 12 micrograms/ml than with any other agent or combination of agents. On the basis of the additive effects prevalently demonstrated in the in vitro study, the combinations of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam are rational therapeutic options. Greater killing of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin--tazobactam. Since treatment failure of P. aeruginosa pneumonia is a significant problem, clinical studies are warranted.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of FK037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of FK037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. Against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, FK037 was less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. Among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to FK037 (MIC > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. With the exception of Enterococcus faecalis, FK037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. The activity of FK037 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. FK037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. Against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, FK037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective than flomoxef. FK037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type II penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (CXase). FK037 scored an MIC range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some CXase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii; and against strains other than P. aeruginosa FK037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. FK037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing E. cloacae, C. freundii and Serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and Escherichia coli at its MIC or higher.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem WY-49605 (SUN5555) against recent clinical isolates from five U.S. medical centers.
AB  - The in vitro activity of WY-49605 (SUN5555) (WY) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. Most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by WY (MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). MIC90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp., and Proteus mirabilis. WY was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). The four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. At 2.0 micrograms/ml, WY inhibited 82% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains isolated from children in Child Health Center, Warsaw.
AB  - This study examines the antibiotic susceptibility of 1792 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized children between January and December 1993. A total of 1015 Gram-negative rods represented by members of Enterobacteriaceae family (770) and nonfermenters (245) were isolated. The most resistant strains were noticed among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. From 38% to 46% of K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, but all of them were sensitive to imipenem. From 60% to 80% of E. cloacae isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, but sensitive to imipenem. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides varied from 30% for gentamicin to 5% for amikacin. About 40% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to carbenicillin, and 25% to azlocillin and piperacillin, but only two strains were resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem. Among Gram-positive cocci the most frequently encountered were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus consisted 74.8% and 34%, respectively. All strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus were sensitive to vancomycin.
TI  - Emergence and mechanisms of bacterial resistance in surgical infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is commonplace among bacteria involved in surgical infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides species. Resistance traits can be encoded on chromosomes or transmissible plasmids. The basic mechanisms of resistance are alteration of drug target, prevention of drug access to target, and drug inactivation. Examples include alteration of penicillin-binding proteins in resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins, ribosomal binding site protection in tetracycline resistance, and beta-lactamase destruction of beta-lactam compounds. Resistance due to the many types of beta-lactamases that have thus far been identified is wide-spread among common pathogens; use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations has proved effective as one means of counteracting such resistance. Contending with resistance involves appropriate use of available antimicrobials, development of novel agents or modification of existing agents, and measures to forestall emergence and spread of resistant organisms.
TI  - Role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the design of dosage schedules for 12-h cefotaxime alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - Pharmacodynamic principles have provided important tools to evaluate and compare  antimicrobial agents, and well as to guide dosing. For beta-lactams, time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has surfaced as the most important factor. However, the area under the inhibitory serum concentration time-curve (AUIC) may be superior when appropriate dosing intervals are selected. Although the target time over the MIC is unclear in humans even when concentrations remain continuously above the MIC, a higher AUIC predicts better clinical outcome up to a maximum. This article provides a pharmacodynamic assessment of 1- and 2-g doses of cefotaxime every 12 h. AUIC24 values and published MIC values for common pathogens (grouped into four groups based on MIC90) were used to predict organisms suitable for treatment with every-12-h regimes. Cefotaxime was inadequate for group 4 organisms including: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acienetobacter sp., and Enterococcus sp. Organisms such as Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. fragilis may be suboptimally treated with cefotaxime every 12 h. Cefotaxime in doses of 1-2 g every 12 h should be useful in patients with normal renal function infected with organisms having MICs < 0.5 microgram/ml. This regimen should obtain AUIC24 values > 125 and ensure adequate time above the MIC. In patients with impaired renal function, because of a longer half-life and higher area under the curve, pathogens with MIC values in the 0.5-2 micrograms/ml range may be treated with cefotaxime every 12 h while maintaining AUICs > 125. Data are also presented for cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h alone and in combination with ofloxacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - In vitro activity of BMS-181139, a new carbapenem with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the carbapenem BMS-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. BMS-181139 was the most active against species of Pseudomonas and related genera Alteromonas and Burkholderia, with MICs for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. Of 22 imipenem-resistant (MIC > 8 micrograms/ml) P. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an MIC of BMS-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem MIC. BMS-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe Proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. Although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, BMS-18139 MICs at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. BMS-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except Clostridium difficile. Inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens but not Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus. BMS-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. BMS-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the MIC for some strains and up to four to eight times the MIC for others. The postantibiotic effect of BMS-181139 was equal to or less than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. BMS-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - The microbial flora in venous leg ulcers without clinical signs of infection. Repeated culture using a validated standardised microbiological technique.
AB  - The change of ulcer size in relation to the presence of species and quantities of microorganisms was analysed in 58 patients with venous leg ulcers, all without clinical signs of infection. Microbiological samples were taken on the day of inclusion and then repeated 4 times at monthly intervals or until the ulcer had healed or was too small to be cultured from. There was growth of microorganisms in all ulcers, and the numbers were below 10(4) per mm2 of ulcer surface in all cases. No correlation was found between ulcer size change and the species and amounts of microorganisms. Sixty-nine species were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 88%, Enterococcus faecalis in 74%, Enterobacter cloacae and Peptococcus magnus in 29%, and fungi in 11% of the samples. One or more obligate anaerobe species was found in 41% of the samples and in half of the ulcers and constituted 62% of all bacterial species. The colonising ulcer flora was markedly constant over time in the individual ulcers regardless of change in size. Resident bacterial species were found in 57 of the 58 ulcers. If all samples were considered, the microorganisms were associated with not more than one fifth of the variability in healing rate, as shown by linear multiple regression analysis. The same species of microorganisms were found in ulcers that decreased (or healed) and in those that increased in size. Although an association between the microorganisms and ulcer healing could not be ruled out in this study, there seems to be no indication for routinely performed culture in the absence of clinical signs of infection in venous leg ulcers.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Disinfection of dental stone casts: antimicrobial effects and physical property alterations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting solutions incorporated into dental stone casts against a standard and representative group of microorganisms and to note changes in the physical properties of the casts. METHODS: Irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were contaminated individually with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei and Candida albicans. Four readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the die stone mix used to pour up the impressions. The set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and 3 d for M. phlei. Subsequently, colony forming units were counted. The physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. RESULTS: Only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1:5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. Two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. Although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions.
TI  - In vitro activity of SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCE-2787, 7-[(Z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. SCE-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. SCE-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of Proteus vulgaris. The MIC of SCE-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. SCE-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. SCE-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci required SCE-2787 MICs of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. No difference between the MICs and MBCs was noted, except for P. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. SCE-2787 was active over a pH range of 6 to 8. The inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) CFU caused only a twofold change in the MIC for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in Enterobacter cloacae and P. aeruginosa. beta-Lactamases from Bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze SCE-2787. There was significant hydrolysis of SCE-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, and TEM-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. SCE-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as P-99 of Enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated TEM-1 of E. coli. SCE-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (Colocynthis citrullus L.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  - Microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, La. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Micrococcus and Candida spp. The rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.
TI  - Kinetic and physical studies of beta-lactamase inhibition by a novel penem, BRL 42715.
AB  - The interactions of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus I, TEM, Klebsiella pneumoniae K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99 beta-lactamases with the novel penem inhibitor BRL 42715 were investigated kinetically and, in some cases, by electrospray mass spectrometry (e.s.m.s.). All the beta-lactamases were rapidly inactivated by BRL 42715, with second-order rate constants ranging from 0.17 to 6.4 microM-1.s-1. The initial stoichiometry of beta-lactamase inhibition was essentially 1:1, with the exception of the K1 enzyme. In this instance about 20 molecules of BRL 42715 were hydrolysed before the enzyme was completely inhibited. Inhibited beta-lactamases did not readily regain activity in the absence of BRL 42715, the half-lives for regeneration of free enzyme ranging from 5 min for the K1 beta-lactamase to over 2 days for the staphylococcal enzyme. Recovery of activity was incomplete for TEM-1, K1 and P99 beta-lactamases, suggesting partitioning of the inhibited enzymes to give a permanently (or at least very stable) inactivated species. Examination of the interactions of the penem with TEM, B. cereus I and P99 beta-lactamases by e.s.m.s. also showed rapid and stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor. In all cases a mass increase of 264 Da over the native enzyme was observed, corresponding to the molecular mass of BRL 42715, showing that no fragmentation of the penem occurred on reaction with the beta-lactamases.
TI  - The spectrum of myositis and rhabdomyolysis associated with bacterial infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: (1) To describe the clinical and radiographic features of 6 patients with myositis or rhabdomyolysis associated with bacterial infection. (2) To analyze the role of computed tomography (CT) in myositis associated with bacterial infection. METHODS: Review of cases treated by the authors with literature review. RESULTS: Two patients had classical pyomyositis with Staphylococcus aureus as the etiologic agent. One patient had pyomyositis with Enterobacter cloacae (the first reported to our knowledge), 2 had myositis/fasciitis (one due to Clostridium perfringens and one due to S. aureus), and one had fatal toxic rhabdomyolysis in association with C. perfringens bacteremia without evidence of gas gangrene. No patient had a completely normal CT scan of affected muscles, but CT scans in 3 patients failed to show abscesses that were subsequently discovered at surgery, while in another patient CT scanning falsely suggested a large abscess that was not present at surgery. CONCLUSION: Infection associated muscle involvement represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that include pyomyositis, myonecrosis, fasciitis/myositis, and toxic rhabdomyolysis. Diagnosis may be delayed by the often mild clinical presentation. CT scanning alone may be unreliable in distinguishing muscle abscess from swollen muscle unless combined with CT guided needle biopsy.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sulbactam/cefoperazone for infections during the chemotherapy of hematologic malignancy].
AB  - In 28 patients with hematologic malignancy, the clinical effect and the safety of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were studied on 45 episodes during granulocytopenic stage after antineoplastic chemotherapy. The overall efficacy rate obtained with SBT/CPZ in combination with other drugs was 62%. The rates for sepsis, suspected sepsis and pneumonia were 67%, 94% and 38%, respectively. The efficacy in those cases that showed granulocyte count less than 300/microliters during the course of administration of SBT/CPZ was 53%, and in those cases that showed granulocyte counts recovery to more than 300/microliters was 73%. Prior antimicrobiological treatments had no influence on the efficacy of SBT/CPZ. SBT/CPZ showed an activity spectrum covering frequently isolated microorganism including Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. Mild adverse effect were observed in 4 episodes (8.8%). These result suggested that SBT/CPZ was thought to be a useful drug for empirical therapy in granulocytopenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
TI  - Cefquinome (HR 111V). In vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  - Cefquinome (formerly HR 111V), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. Cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest MIC (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Providencia stuartii strains. A total of 90% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome activity of particular note for Gram-positive isolates included Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. Cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus species (MIC90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). When tested against organisms possessing Bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (MIC, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. This compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Investigation of synergism with combinations of dibromopropamidine isethionate or propamidine isethionate and polymyxin B.
AB  - Combinations of polymyxin B and dibromopropamidine isethionate exhibited synergistic inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Similar results were obtained with polymyxin B plus propamidine combinations except that propamidine was not as active as dibromopropamidine and the combination of polymyxin B plus propamidine against S. aureus only had additive activity. The antibacterial agents were tested in solutions and in a cream formulation. The findings indicate a potential for the use of selected combinations of these antibacterial agents in the treatment of wound and superficial eye infections.
TI  - Assessment of bacterial cross-transmission as a cause of infections in patients in intensive care units.
AB  - The prevalence of possible cross-transmission of selected bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) among infected patients was evaluated in five intensive care units (ICUs) over 6 months. A total of 284 isolates from clinical specimens were typed by plasmid profile analysis (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae), restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA (S. aureus), and/or pulse-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA (P. aeruginosa, enterococci, S. aureus, and other bacteria without plasmid DNA). By typing criteria, only 13% of the 177 isolates obtained after > 2 days in an ICU were classified as possibly cross-transmitted. Many patients whose cultures yielded bacteria of an identical type may have been the sources rather than the recipients of these organisms. Episodes of possible cross-transmission were scattered among all ICUs, usually affected only two patients, and were associated with most bacterial species. These data suggest that endemic bacterial cross-transmission in ICUs is relatively infrequent and that cross-transmitted bacteria are not common causes of endemic ICU-related nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - Polymicrobial polyarticular arthritis.
AB  
TI  - Comparative serum bactericidal activities of three doses of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of three intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were studied comparatively in 30 patients. Single 200-, 300-, and 400-mg intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were given over 30 min to 10 patients each, and serum samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h after the start of the infusion. Serum drug concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis methods. Serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined for samples obtained at 0.5, 4, 8, and 12 h. Excellent activity was demonstrated up to 12 h by all doses against E. coli and E. cloacae. Much poorer titers were observed for the remaining organisms, although the 400-mg dose prompted improved results against P. aeruginosa with a mean bactericidal titer of 1:2.9 at 8 h. In conclusion, while the 200-mg dose appears to be largely adequate for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, it seems that when P. aeruginosa is involved, 400 mg twice a day or even three times a day is more appropriate. Intravenous ciprofloxacin performs poorly against A. calcoaceticus and S. aureus, even at a higher dose.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - Assessing the need for anaerobic medium for the recovery of clinically significant blood culture isolates in children.
AB  - We examined the sensitivity of several BACTEC media options for the detection of  bacteremia and fungemia in children at two pediatric health care facilities. At one institution a single aerobic bottle containing PEDS Plus medium was as sensitive in identifying positive blood cultures as the combination of aerobic and anaerobic media (77% vs. 80%; P = 1.0). When data from both facilities were combined, a blood culture set containing both aerobic and anaerobic media detected significantly more positive blood cultures than any single aerobic medium. However, the aerobic/anaerobic bottle combination was not significantly better than a blood culture set containing two aerobic media and, in absolute terms, the latter identified more cases of bacteremia. Of the 116 clinically significant episodes of bacteremia identified in this study, only 1 was caused by an anaerobic bacterium. We conclude that the routine use of anaerobic media for blood cultures of pediatric patients might be unnecessary but that the use of two different aerobic media could increase the sensitivity of the BACTEC blood culture system.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Rapid emergence of quinolone resistance in cirrhotic patients treated with norfloxacin to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - We carried out quantitative culturing of stools from 31 hospitalized alcoholic patients with cirrhosis and ascites, before treatment with 400 mg of norfloxacin per day, weekly for the first month, and then every 2 weeks thereafter for 15 to 229 days (median, 54 days). Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae virtually disappeared from the stools (< 10(2)/g), but treatment had little effect on enterococci. No selection of resistant organisms occurred in 15 patients, but the remaining 16 patients developed fecal organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones between days 14 and 43 of treatment (median, 25 days). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated four times, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated six times, Citrobacter freundii was isolated four times, Enterobacter cloacae was isolated three times, Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated twice, Proteus rettgeri was isolated once, and untypeable streptococci were isolated six times. Some isolates persisted, while others were transient (one to seven consecutively positive cultures). The MICs of four quinolones (nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were determined by use of experimental microwell strips (ATB CMI; Biomerieux S.A.). All the strains isolated before treatment were susceptible to the four quinolones, with low MICs, whereas those isolated during norfloxacin treatment were highly resistant. Long-term norfloxacin administration thus carries a risk of disturbing the bacterial ecology in these patients, suggesting that digestive decontamination should no longer be prescribed routinely to cirrhotic patients with ascites.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial labdane-type diterpenes from the aerial parts of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus.
AB  - Seven labdane-type diterpenoids were isolated from the leaves of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus; their structures were established by spectroscopic means. All compounds were tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity against three cell line systems: KB, P-388; and NSCLC-N6. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans as well.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of FK-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  - The in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, FK-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). Our PAE results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. Gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while Gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). Even though the PAE test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/L for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/L for FK-037), the marginal or species dependent, short PAE values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the Cmax, AUC, and serum elimination half-life.
TI  - [Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in the Czech Republic. The Working Group for Monitoring Resistance in the Czech Republic].
AB  - In 1991 the authors made an investigation on the resistance of clinically important bacteria. Seventeen antibiotic centres in the Czech Republic participated in the investigation. The resistance to antibiotics of 32,567 strains of twelve bacterial species isolated from hospitalized patients depends on 1. the type of bacteria and antibiotics, 2. the source (specimen of pathological material) and 3. the locality (hospital). The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin with the exception of one hospital is not more than 6%, in rare instances also resistance to vancomycin was encountered. The frequency of resistance of gram-negative rods to so-called reserve antibiotics (cephalosporins of the third generation, quinolones and amikacin) depends markedly on the type of bacteria, being highest in typical causal agents of hospital infections--Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the exception of cephalosporins the resistance of gram-negative rods and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine is much greater than in strains from other clinical materials. The frequency of resistance in faculty hospitals which concentrate patients with more serious diseases is high, the highest resistance was, however, recorded in the North Bohemian area--in pneumococci against penicillin (13%) and in haemophili against ampicillin (17%). Every hospital is a closed ecological niche with a typical bacterial population and resistance rate. A competent estimate of an adequate and probably effective antibiotic for immediate initiation of treatment of an urgent infection can thus be made only by somebody with close and steady knowledge of the state of resistance in a given hospital.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Interaction of clavulanate with class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - The interactions between clavulanate and three class C enzymes have been studied  in detail. In all cases, the reactions followed branched pathways where 25-150 turnovers occurred before inactivation was completed. Reactivation rates were quite low. The poor efficiency of clavulanate as a class C inactivator appeared to rest upon a very slow acylation of the protein, and of a relatively high turnover rate.
TI  - Early bacterial infections in lung transplant recipients.
AB  - Early bacterial pulmonary infections within 2 weeks after lung transplantation were studied in 29 patients undergoing surgery between December 1989 and May 1992. Suspected pulmonary infections occurred in 11 patients (38 percent). The most common bacterial organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (45 percent; 5/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36 percent; 4/11), Escherichia coli (27 percent; 3/11), Staphylococcus aureus (18 percent; 2/11), and Enterobacter cloacae (18 percent; 2/11). The mortality due to infection was 3 percent (1/29) in the early postoperative period. None of the following variables was found to be of prognostic significance: positive donor cultures, ischemic time of the graft, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, number of courses of methylprednisolone for acute rejection, duration of postoperative intubation, and type of surgical procedure. The presence of infection in the early postoperative period did not influence long-term survival. In the absence of prognostic parameters, prompt adjustment of antibiotic therapy to the results of antibiograms remains the most important therapeutic step in the management of infections in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Cefepime was active at low concentrations (MIC50 values < or = 0.06 mg/L and MIC90 values < or = 0.12 mg/L) against non-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs were between 0.016 and 16 mg/L; the highest MIC values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, MICs were < or = 0.5 mg/L, but MICs against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. Ticarcillin-sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/L, while cefepime MICs were 8-64 mg/L for strains resistant to ticarcillin. The cefepime MIC50 value for Haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/L. Against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime MICs were 0.5-16 mg/L; MICs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/L). Against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime MIC values were 0.03-16 mg/L; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/L. Streptococci (Groups A, C and G) were sensitive to cefepime with MICs ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/L (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L; MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). The activity of cefepime against Group B streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with MIC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Most enterococci and all Listeria monocytogenes strains had MICs > or = 32 mg/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefepime and other antimicrobials: survey of European isolates.
AB  - Cefepime, a new cephalosporin which has a broad-spectrum of activity was tested in vitro against 1961 Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from European hospitals. Cefepime was highly active against Gram-negative organisms, inhibiting over 94% of strains tested. The overall susceptibility rate for cefepime against all isolates was 81%. Cefepime was more active than any of the third-generation cephalosporins tested against species capable of producing type I beta-lactamases, e.g. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes. The activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of ceftazidime and substantially greater than those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. All cephalosporins except ceftazidime exhibited high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus but poor activity was observed against methicillin-resistant strains. Overall susceptibility to cefepime is lower in Europe than it is in North America.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity after administration of four cephalosporins in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was determined against ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter cloacae in six volunteers 1 h and 4 h after intravenous infusion of 1 g and 2 g cefotaxime and cefmenoxime, and 2 g flomoxef, and against ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after infusion of 1 g and 2 g ceftazidime. Flomoxef showed the highest SBA against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. All cephalosporins had high SBA against gram-negative rods. Cefotaxime had the highest SBA against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The SBA against Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 1 g and 2 g doses of ceftazidime was very similar.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen A), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen B), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen C) administered every 12 h for seven doses. Mean steady-state peak concentrations in serum for regimens A, B, and C were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (P < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were 4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (P < 0.05, C versus A and B). Mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens A, B, and C, respectively (P < 0.05, all comparisons). SBTs were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mean steady-state peak SBTs for regimens A, B, and C, respectively, were as follows: S. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, S. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; E. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; E. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; P. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. These differences in SBTs within each genus were statistically significant. The majority of predicted SBTs were within one dilution of measured SBTs. Areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for E. coli, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. Ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin, but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of SBTs.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial DNA purification system for plasmid analysis of nosocomial bacterial pathogens.
AB  - This study evaluated the Promega Magic Minipreps (MM) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) DNA purification system for use in plasmid analysis of common nosocomial bacterial pathogens. The MM system is a kit that includes lysis solutions and buffers and incorporates a minicolumn of DNA binding resin for recovery of plasmid DNA. The MM system was used according to the manufacturer's directions to recover plasmids for agarose gel electrophoresis from clinical isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. For Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus, lysozyme and lysostaphin, respectively, were used for pretreatment. Plasmid DNA from ten isolates could be recovered in approximately one hour with very little manipulation and no phenol/chloroform extractions and was suitable for restriction endonuclease digestion. Compared with a standard miniprep protocol, the MM system was much easier to perform and resulted in significant cost savings due to a 50% reduction in technologist time. The authors conclude that the MM system is a convenient and cost-effective method for clinical microbiology laboratories for recovering plasmid DNA from nosocomial bacterial pathogens.
TI  - In vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  - Although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. Microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. Gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. We therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative rods against antibiotics. Using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by Maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for Port-A-Cath-systems. Organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae). All organisms but Klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. Production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated Pseudomonas. After 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with various antimicrobial agents. The following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. Despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective MICs of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible organism. These in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and Septi-Chek Release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was made of the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories,  Cranbury, N.J.) and the Septi-Chek Release bottle (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, N.J.). From 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to Centers for Disease Control definitions. Statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the Isolator system: Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.0001), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (P = 0.008), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.05), Salmonella spp. (P = 0.03), and Candida albicans (P = 0.02). The Septi-Chek Release system required a longer period of time than the Isolator system for detection of the following organisms:S. aureus (P = 0.0001), Enterococcus spp. (P = 0.0001), Enterobacter cloacae (P = 0.03), Escherichia coli (P = 0.0001), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.03), K. pneumoniae (P = 0.02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.002), and C. albicans (P = 0.005). There were 430 episodes of bloodstream infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to S. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (P = 0.0001) by the Isolator system than by the Septi-Chek Release system. However, episodes of bloodstream infections due to S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli were detected significantly faster by the Isolator system.
TI  - Infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in Milan, Italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  - The pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. Between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. The most frequent isolates were: Pseud. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae, such as Acinetobacter, Citrobacter. The most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus isolates. Staph. aureus, Klebsiella and E. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; Enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and Pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. E. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and P. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. Thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of Enterococcus spp. and E. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of Enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Infectious sequelae after endoscopic sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices: role of antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - In order to determine the incidence of infection following sclerotherapy and the  role of antimicrobial prophylaxis, a prospective randomized control study was performed comparing i.v. imipenem/cilastatin, with an infusion of dextrose-saline as a control group. One hundred patients with bleeding esophageal varices were included. All episodes of infection were documented during admission to the unit. Ninety-seven patients were evaluable. Post-sclerotherapy bacteremia developed in six (5.6%) of 107 sclerotherapy sessions in the control group and one (1.1%) of the 88 sclerotherapy sessions in the imipenem/cilastatin group (P < or = 0.1, NS): six of these seven post-sclerotherapy bacteremias occurred after emergency sclerotherapy. Infection within 7 days of the procedure was documented after 43 (22.1%) of the 195 sclerotherapy sessions, 18 (20.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group and 25 (23.4%) in the control group (P = NS). These infections were significantly more common after emergency sclerotherapy, 40 (34.8%) of 115 sessions, than after elective sclerotherapy, three (3.8%) of 80 sessions (P < or = 0.0001). A short prophylactic antibiotic regime does not reduce the risk of early bacteremia or the frequency of infection after sclerotherapy. The higher risk of infection after emergency sclerotherapy may be therefore related more to the gastrointestinal hemorrhage and its associated effects than to sclerotherapy.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in intensive care units: an overview of their epidemiology, outcome, and prevention.
AB  - Among all hospitalized patients, ICU patients are at greatest risk for both endemic and epidemic nosocomial infections. The highest infection rates are seen in surgical, burn, trauma, and neonatal ICUs. Acquisition of infection is a major determinant of mortality in ICUs, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. Predominant pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Candida spp. They are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobial agents than are isolates from elsewhere in the hospital. Exposure to invasive medical devices is the predominant risk factor for infection, and strategies to prevent infection are aimed at reducing microbial colonization on and around devices. Improvements in technology, such as coating devices with antimicrobial agents, have been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection. Handwashing, particularly with antiseptic soaps, remains the cornerstone of infection control in the ICU.
TI  - [Chemotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin for severe infections accompanied by malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) was evaluated in 30 cases of serious infections associated with hematological malignancies. 1. Among 28 evaluable cases, excellent efficacy was obtained in 6 cases and good effectiveness in 10 cases, resulting in a high clinical efficacy rate (57.1%). The clinical effectiveness of IPM/CS was not dependent on neutrophil count in peripheral blood. A 53.8% efficacy rate was observed in 26 cases which had received pretreatment with other antibiotics. 2. Antibacterial activities of IPM/CS have so far been evaluated against organisms isolated in 20 of 28 cases: 2 strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 2 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 9 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, and 8 other strains. 3. Among 3 evaluable cases treated with IPM/CS alone, response was good in 1 case. Among 25 patients receiving IPM/CS in combination with an aminoglycoside or a penicillin, the efficacy rate was 60%. 4. Five patients had IPM/CS-related adverse events; nausea and vomiting in 2 cases, seizures in 1 case, small increases in GOT and GPT in 2 cases, and the appearance of casts in urine sediment in 1 case. These patients, however, tolerated the complete course of therapy with IPM/CS except the 2 cases with nausea and vomiting. These results indicate that chemotherapy with IPM/CS is effective for the treatment of severe infectious diseases accompanied by hematological disorders.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth or may kill bacteria by inhibiting cell  wall synthesis or protein synthesis. The amount of endotoxin released during antibiotic action has been found to be clinically important. Nine antibiotics, representing seven classes, were studied for the amounts of endotoxin released during their action on susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus, which produces no endotoxin, was used as a control organism. Aztreonam induced the highest release of endotoxin, whereas other antibiotics such as imipenem and the quinolones induced the lowest release of endotoxin. Although the quantities of endotoxin released are not easily explained from the established mechanisms of antibiotic action, our findings may have implications for therapy of the acutely ill, septic patient in whom release of large quantities of endotoxin may be catastrophic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6R, 7R)-7-[[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. FK-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. Of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of FK-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus bovis. The MIC90 for many of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. The MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. K. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime MICs of > 32 micrograms/ml with Bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of FK-037 per ml. E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and S. aureus stably resistant to FK-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of FK-037. The FK-037 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides species were resistant to FK-037 (MIC, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). MBCs were identical to or within twofold of the MICs except for a 32-fold greater MBC for P. aeruginosa. Inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of FK-037. FK-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by Bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. Nonetheless, FK-037 inhibited bacteria possessing TEM-3, -5, and -7 and SHV -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. Overall, FK-037 has lower MICs against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
TI  - Importance of beta-lactamase induction.
AB  - Induction of an enzyme is a temporary phenomenon in which the rate of enzyme synthesis is greatly increased in response to the presence of an inducer in the environment. Induction of beta-lactamase synthesis is important for the resistance of staphylococci to penicillins since the drug both induces synthesis of the enzyme and is hydrolysed by it. Similarly, some compounds both strongly induce and are hydrolysed by the chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacilli (e.g. amoxicillin and cefoxitin for Enterobacter cloacae). Other compounds (e.g. piperacillin and cefotaxime) although labile are poor inducers, so that in the case of these drugs the phenomenon of induction is not important but the presence of the enzyme is, since resistant mutants with genetically derepressed synthesis of the enzyme can emerge. Induction can also be important when a strong inducer is present with a poor inducer and antagonises the activity of the latter.
TI  - Effects on cell morphology of growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus in subinhibitory concentrations of p-aminobenzoic acid.
AB  - Light microscopy and electron microscopy studies with Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of p-aminobenzoic acid indicate that p-aminobenzoic acid may have a direct or indirect effect on the cell walls. The morphological effects of p-aminobenzoic acid varied with different bacterial species. E. cloacae grown in the presence of p-aminobenzoic acid produced filaments while P. aeruginosa cells were elongated and had thicker peripheral cell walls. S. aureus had increased overall cell size and thicker transverse cell walls.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - E1077, a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antibacterial activity, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with those of cefpirome, cefuzonam, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime. E1077 showed broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E1077 was as active as cefpirome; the MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) was 1.0 microgram/ml. Against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E1077 was less active (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml). For Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E1077 was fourfold more active than cefpirome, with MIC90s of 1.0 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. For Proteus vulgaris, the MIC90 of E1077 was 32 micrograms/ml, which was fourfold greater than that of cefpirome. Against other gram-negative strains tested, the in vitro activity of E1077 was comparable to that of cefpirome. The broad antibacterial spectrum of E1077 was reflected by its in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against S. aureus 90 and P. aeruginosa E7, E1077 had activity superior to those of the reference compounds; against most other bacterial strains, the efficacy of E1077 was similar to that of cefpirome. Levels of E1077 in plasma and tissue of mice were studied. At 15 min after a single subcutaneous administration, E1077 displayed high peak levels (mean, 31.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of E1077 are similar to those of cefpirome except against P. aeruginosa and P. vulgaris.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of unripe papaya.
AB  - The meat, seed and pulp of Carica papaya Linn., a popular traditional medicinal herb grown in the tropics, was shown by the agar-cup method to be bacteriostatic against several enteropathogens such as Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The same parts of papaya were unequivocably demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectrometry to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (5.8 x 10(14) spins/ml), hydroxyl (5.1 x 10(14) spins/ml) and superoxide (1.2 x 10(14) spins/ml) radicals with the seed giving the highest activity at concentrations (IC50) of 2.1, 10.0 and 8.7 mg/ml, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity in the meat, seed and pulp amounts to about 32, 98 and 33 units/ml; comparable to those of soybean paste miso, rice bran and baker's yeast. Vitamin C, malic acid, citric acid and glucose are some of the possible antioxidative components in papaya. Our study correlates the bacteriostatic activity of papaya with its scavenging action on superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which could be part of the cellular metabolism of such enteropathogens. This is indicative of the pathophysiological role of these reactive oxygen species in gastrointestinal diseases and papaya's ability to counteract the oxidative stress.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - A comparative study of the numbers of bacteria present in enteral feeds prepared  and administered in hospital and the home.
AB  - Levels and types of bacterial contamination were compared in enteral feeds prepared and administered in hospital or in the home. Samples of feed administered to children suffering from cystic fibrosis were collected for microbiological analysis immediately after preparation, immediately prior to use (unless administered after preparation) and at the end of feeding. No bacteria were detected in 51 (70%) of the 73 feeds sampled on the hospital ward, and in most of the remaining feeds viable counts were less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu) ml-1. However, only four (18%) of the feeds sampled in the home were free from bacterial growth and the remaining 18 feeds contained from 10(1) to more than 10(6) cfu ml-1. Bacteria isolated from feeds sampled both in hospital and the home, included Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp., viridans and faecal streptococci, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from 11 of the 73 hospital feeds and four of the 22 home feeds. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from five of the home feeds but from none of the hospital feeds. The higher incidence and numbers of bacteria found in home enteral feeds indicate that further, more detailed studies need to be carried out to find the sources and routes of this contamination and devise methods to minimize the problem.
TI  - Postoperative posterior spinal wound infections.
AB  - The incidence of postoperative spinal infections increases with the complexity of the procedure. Diskectomy is associated with less than a 1% risk of infection; spinal fusion without instrumentation is associated with a 1%-5% risk; and fusion with instrumentation may be associated with a risk of 6% or more. Twenty-two postoperative posterior spinal infections that occurred during a three-year period were reviewed for this report. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism cultured (more than 50% of the cases). Other recurring organisms were Staphylococcus epidermis, Peptococcus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides. Many patients had multiple organisms. Risk factors appeared to include advanced age, prolonged hospital bed rest, obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, and infection at remote sites. Operative factors included prolonged surgery (greater than five hours), high volume of personnel moving through the operating room, and instrumentation. Postoperative contamination may occur and may be related to prolonged postoperative bed rest, skin maceration (thoracolumbosacral orthoses), and drainage tubes exiting distally from lumbar wounds (toward the rectum). Effective treatment includes early diagnosis, surgical debridement and irrigation, and parenteral antibiotics. Superficial infections were treated successfully with wound closure over outflow tubes, and deep infections with inflow-outflow systems. Maintaining the instrumentation in place was possible in most cases. Parenteral antibiotics were maintained for six weeks in every case.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - We compared the pharmacokinetics and the serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. Fifteen healthy volunteers received 1 g of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone intravenously, 500 mg of imipenem-cilastatin intravenously, and 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally. High-performance liquid chromatographic assays were used to quantitate unchanged antibiotic in plasma and urine. Serum bactericidal activities were determined against six clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a modified microdilution method of Reller and Stratton (L. B. Reller and C. W. Stratton, J. Infect. Dis. 136:196-204, 1977). Overall, cefpirome exhibited pharmacokinetics similar to those of ceftazidime: half-life (t1/2), 1.95 h; concentration at 1 h (C1h), 47 to 49 micrograms/ml for both antibiotics. Ceftriaxone displayed the longest t1/2 (7.65 h) and the highest C1h (137.8 micrograms/ml), while we observed the shortest t1/2 (1.05 h) and the lowest C1h (19.85 micrograms/ml) with imipenem. At 1 h, cefpirome and, even more so, imipenem showed significantly better serum bactericidal activities against S. aureus (1:273 and 1:80) than did the other antibiotics (P less than 0.0005; analysis of variance with randomized block design and Bonferroni correction). Against E. cloacae, we observed the highest serum bactericidal titers at 1 h with cefpirome, and this superiority vis-a-vis the other antibiotics tested was maintained for up to 8 h after dosing. Ceftazidime remained the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (serum bactericidal activity titers, 1:43 at 1 h) up to 8 h. In summary, the study showed that cefpirome and imipenem provide more potent serum bactericidal activities than do broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus; thus, both of these antibiotics should be adequate against serious S. aureus infections. In addition, cefpirome appears to be a promising alternative for treatment of infections caused by E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Outbreak of surgical wound infections associated with total hip arthroplasty.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Describe an outbreak of surgical wound infections associated with total hip arthroplasty; identify risk factors for surgical wound infection during the pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. SETTING: A 100-bed hospital. From May 1 to September 30, 1988, 7 of 15 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty developed surgical wound infections from Staphylococcus aureus (5), Enterobacter cloacae (1), beta-hemolytic streptococci (1), enterococci (1), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1), and Escherichia coli (1) (attack rate = 46.7%). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort studies comparing surgical wound infection rates by patient- and procedure-related risk factors during the pre-outbreak and outbreak periods were conducted. Drop plate quantitative air culturing was conducted in 10 consecutive total hip arthroplasties in the subsequent 6 months. RESULTS: Rates of surgical wound infection were surgically higher for arthroplasties in which no intraoperative prophylactic antimicrobials were given (44% versus 8%, relative risk [RR] = 5.4, p = .01), or in which the posterior approach (20% versus 3%, RR = 6.7, p = .04) or a specific prosthesis (39% versus 5%, RR = 6.3, p = 0.01) was used. The surgical wound infection rate was highest when one circulating nurse, Nurse A, assisted (47% versus 4%, RR = 12.8, p less than .001). Logistic regression analysis identified use of the posterior approach (RR = 1.8, p = .04) and Nurse A's participation (RR = 5.0, p less than .001) as independent risk factors for surgical wound infection. Interviews of the nursing supervisor indicated that Nurse A had recurrent dermatitis on her hands. During 6 months following Nurse A's reassignment, the rate declined significantly (from 7/15 to 0/10, p = .01). Drop plate culturing yielded 2 to 10 colonies per plate of organisms that did not match outbreak organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks associated with personnel generally involve only 1 species. In this outbreak, Nurse A (possibly because of her dermatitis), technique, the posterior approach, and/or other undetermined factors were the primary predictors of surgical wound infection.
TI  - Nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (TECRA) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  - A staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (TECRA) has recently become commercially available. Since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types A to E (SEA to SEE) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. In this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of SEA, SEB, and SEC in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of SEA per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of SEB per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of SEC per ml. However, the TECRA kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than Staphylococcus aureus, such as Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. The substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees C, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate Sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). The problem of false-positive results with the TECRA kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees C) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate Sepharose for 4 h before use of the TECRA kit.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  - During the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - Bacterial mediastinitis after heart transplantation.
AB  - Bacterial mediastinal abscess or mediastinitis developed in nine (2.5%) of 361 consecutive patients who underwent isolated heart transplantation at the Texas Heart Institute. All nine patients had at least one predisposing factor that may have contributed to the development of mediastinitis. These included insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, repeat operation for postoperative mediastinal hemorrhage, Staphylococcus aureus pneumonitis, and cardiac allograft rejection in the early postoperative period (less than 30 days), necessitating steroid pulse therapy alone or in combination with murine-derived monoclonal antibody (OKT3). In six of the nine patients, the diagnosis of mediastinitis was made on the basis of clinical findings (unstable sternum and incisional erythema, with or without gross purulence), and in the other three patients, diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography of the chest. Culture data were unequivocal in all patients; S. aureus was the most frequent (five patients), followed by S. epidermidis (two patients), and Enterobacter cloacae (two patients). Computed tomography-directed percutaneous drainage and systemic antibiotics were successful in treating two of three patients who had stable sternums with mediastinal abscess. In the remaining seven patients, sternal and mediastinal debridement with rewiring of the sternum was successfully applied. No patient required muscle or omental flap coverage, and no patient experienced a recurrence of mediastinitis during an average follow-up period of 35 months (range, 12 to 46 months).
TI  - Handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  - Hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. Often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the handwashing agents used. In this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (E), isopropanol 40% (I) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (AC) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. After each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. Fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. Thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('Sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species used (197 examinations). Only AC had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with S. aureus (126 examinations; AC compared with E and I; P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. After contamination with Ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but E and AC seemed to be somewhat more effective than I (P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.01 respectively). When successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, AC was the most effective decontaminant. However, Ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. Bathing of hands in AC for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. The study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. II. Stability to beta-lactamases and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246, the active metabolite of the prodrug-ester HR 916, is active against strains producing the widespread plasmid-encoded TEM-1, TEM-2 and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. Except for TEM-7 the activity of RU 29 246 against strains producing extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-6, SHV-2, SHV-4, SHV-5, CMY-1, CTX-M), however, is low. Relative hydrolysis rates of RU 29 246 are comparable with those of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of CS-807, and are extremely low for the TEM-1 and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. The compound demonstrates remarkable inhibitory activity against the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. In the presence of 1.7 microM this enzyme loses 50% of its activity. At concentrations of 0.43, 0.003 and 0.01 micrograms/ml the compound binds preferentially to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 of Escherichia coli K12, to the PBPs 2x and 3 of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 and to PBP 1 of Staphylococcus aureus SG 511, respectively.
TI  - Impact of voluntary vs enforced compliance of third-generation cephalosporin use  in a teaching hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the impact of voluntary compliance and enforced compliance with institutional guidelines for initiating third-generation cephalosporin therapy. DESIGN: An audit of third-generation cephalosporin use during a 6-month period shortly after ceftriaxone and ceftazidime were added to the hospital formulary already containing cefotaxime was performed. During this period, compliance to institutional guidelines for initiating therapy was voluntary. A follow-up audit during a similar 6-month period was performed to assess compliance with institutional guidelines shortly after an enforcement policy was placed in effect. The results of these two audits were compared to assess usage patterns of these cephalosporins, compliance rates with institutional guidelines for initiating therapy, use of susceptibility testing to guide therapy, effect of use of these drugs on susceptibility patterns within the hospital, and third-generation cephalosporin costs during periods when institutional policy was unenforced and enforced. RESULTS: Only 24.2% of 66 courses of third-generation cephalosporins were initiated in compliance with institutional guidelines during the initial audit period. Susceptibility testing revealed an organism susceptible to a first-generation cephalosporin in 13 courses but in only six instances was a switch to the more narrow-spectrum antibiotic performed. At the time routine susceptibility testing to ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was instituted, 92% of Enterobacter cloacae were sensitive to ceftriaxone and 89% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime. Fifteen months later, when voluntary compliance to institutional policy was terminated, 70% of E cloacae were sensitive to ceftriaxone and 73% of P aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime. During the last 6 months of this period, pharmacy expenditures totaled $50,000. The second audit revealed 85.4% of 48 courses of treatment complied with guidelines for initiating therapy. Since enforcement was instituted, sensitivity of E cloacae to ceftriaxone has risen to 88% and sensitivity of P aeruginosa to ceftazidime has increased to 80%. Pharmacy expenditures decreased to $23,000.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pharmacokinetic disposition and bactericidal activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone in serum and blister fluid.
AB  - Cefepime is a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent gram-positive and gram-negative activity including activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. The pharmacokinetic disposition of cefepime is similar to that of ceftazidime. We compared the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the extent and duration of bactericidal activity in serum and suction-induced blister fluid after single 2-g intravenous doses of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone given to healthy subjects. One clinical isolate each of E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus was used to assess bactericidal activity. Results of the pharmacokinetic analysis were similar to previously reported data for these drugs. The high serum protein binding of cefoperazone (approximately 90%) contributed to poor blister fluid penetration. The other drugs penetrated well into this fluid compartment. Cefepime showed significantly greater bactericidal activity in serum and blister fluid against E. cloacae than the other study drugs, ceftazidime was significantly better in serum and blister fluid against P. aeruginosa, and cefoperazone was significantly better against S. aureus only in serum. None of the study drugs had significant bactericidal activity in blister fluid against S. aureus. Cefepime is a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections due to E. cloacae.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Septic arthritis following arthroscopy: clinical syndromes and analysis of risk factors.
AB  - During a 4-year study of 4,256 knee arthroscopies, eighteen patients became infected (infection rate 0.42%). Occurrence of infection was strongly associated with use of long-acting intraarticular intraoperative corticosteroids. Infection was more common among patients with longer surgery operating times, increased numbers of procedures during surgery, prior procedures, and performance of chondroplasty or soft tissue debridement. Subsequent to the study, the infection rate fell to 0.1%. Twenty-four infections were studied (our eighteen plus six other concurrent community cases); twelve were due to Staphylococcus aureus, eleven to coagulase-negative staphylococci, and one to Enterobacter cloacae. Seventy percent of the patients had onset of symptoms within 3 days of surgery. Most patients with coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections had fevers less than 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F), negative Gram stains on synovial fluid, normal peripheral leukocyte counts, and somewhat indolent, mild clinical syndromes, while most patients with S. aureus infections had higher fevers, positive synovial Gram stains, peripheral leukocytosis, and more acute and severe clinical syndromes. Knee pain, swelling, and warmth always occurred, but erythema was noted in only 30% of patients. Treatment with 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics was successful in all but one patient. Long-term results were excellent in sixteen of twenty-two patients.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in infants in spite of prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis.
AB  - The efficacy of preventing neonatal urinary infection in infants by diagnosing hydronephrosis in the fetus on obstetrical ultrasonography was studied. 426 infants had uroradiologic evaluation between 1984 and June 1991 because they had hydronephrosis detected in utero. Thirteen with posterior urethral valves were excluded. Of the remaining 413, 13 (3.1%) presented with urinary infection in the first 6 months of life. Ten of the 13 were boys and 7 were not circumcised. Eleven of the 13 infants less than 2 months old were formula-fed. The causes of hydronephrosis were reflux alone in 6, ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 6 (with coexisting ipsilateral reflux in 4), and primary megaureter in 1. Ultrasonography alone was insufficient to exclude reflux. Amoxicillin-resistant bacteria were the causative organisms in all 10 for whom bacteriology data was available. Four categories of management failure were identified: 1) failure of communication of the prenatal findings, 2) antibiotics not prescribed, 3) antibiotics prescribed but not administered, and 4) infection in spite of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. Uncircumcised formula-fed male infants with reflux seemed to be at special risk for infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the new quinolone CI-960 (PD 127391) against clinical isolates at a major tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the new fluoroquinolone CI-960 (PD 127391) was evaluated against 1,162 clinical isolates and compared with other quinolones and various commonly used antibiotics. CI-960 was highly effective against members of Enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 626 of the 629 isolates at a less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml concentration. All the 305 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomona maltophilia, and Acinetobacter were susceptible to CI-960. It was the only effective drug against 10 multi-resistant isolates of pseudomonads and Acinetobacter. All staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03-0.5 microgram/ml of CI-960. Like other drugs of its class, it had little activity against enterococci.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. What are the choices?
AB  - Mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. Successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. The physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the MIC at the site of infection. Gram-negative bacilli, notably Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the Gram-positive cocci. Pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. Protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. Penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. Quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. Penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. Aminoglycosides should not be used alone. Combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of Gram-negative resistant mutants. It should not be used routinely except for P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens infections.
TI  - Beta-lactamase inhibitors: relation between kinetic data and in-vitro synergism studies.
AB  - Because of the need for control of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance and the recent development of tazobactam, the author has examined the inhibitors of various beta-lactamases for their effectiveness. On the basis of the kinetic data, tazobactam exhibited the highest affinity to various beta-lactamases. A combination with tazobactam was found to enhance the effectiveness of piperacillin against S. aureus producing penicillinase, E. coli producing TEM-1 or TEM 2 enzymes and class I beta-lactamase-derepressed isolates of E. cloacae, Serratia spp. and C. freundii, however not P. aeruginosa, while there was no marked synergism in beta-lactamase-derepressed clones of K. oxytoca.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of RU29246 (HR916 metabolite) compared with four other oral beta-lactams tested against more than 5000 clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of RU29246, the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin ester HR916, was compared in a multicenter study with that of the four oral beta-lactam antibiotics cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxicillin/CA). RU29246 was generally 2- to 8-fold more active than the other oral cephalosporins and comparable to amoxicillin/CA against staphylococci, and was the most active cephalosporin against group B streptococci. All four cephalosporins were ineffective against enterococci. RU29246 was the only cephalosporin consistently active against Acinetobacter, but all beta-lactam antibiotics had poor activity against Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia. RU29246 was comparable to cefixime and more active than the other cephalosporins against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, all of the antibiotics had poor activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Quality control reference ranges for the quality control organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 are proposed for the broth dilution method based on data derived from this multicenter study.
TI  - An evaluation of the antibacterial activities of combinations of sulfonamides, trimethoprim, dibromopropamidine, and silver nitrate compared with their uptakes by selected bacteria.
AB  - Modifications of antibacterial activity have been demonstrated using combinations of two antibacterials from trimethoprim, sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, and silver sulfadiazine), silver nitrate, and dibromopropamidine isethionate, either formulated in a cream base or dissolved in peptone water. The creams were evaluated using the agar cup diffusion method in isosensitest agar. The peptone water solutions provided fractional inhibitory concentrations for combinations of the antibacterial substances. The test organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial uptakes of antibacterial combinations, determined by either an HPLC assay method or an atomic absorption method, combined with dry cell weight determinations, indicated that enhancement of activity of the antibacterial combinations against P. aeruginosa (two strains) and E. cloacae were related to marked increases in the bacterial uptake of the chemical agents. Decreases in activity were related to decreased uptake of either dibromopropamidine and/or silver ions. The effect of the trimethoprim and the sulfonamides was shown to depend on their effect on bacterial folate synthesis. It is suggested that partial blockade of the folate synthetic pathway leads to an effect on cell permeability which results in increased uptake of antibacterials. Dibromopropamidine isethionate also has an effect on cell permeability which produces an increased bacterial uptake of a second antibacterial present in the medium. These findings provide further explanation of how subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfonamide combinations are synergistic against a wide range of bacteria even when certain bacteria are resistant to either member of the combination.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime and ten other cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including beta-lactamase producers.
AB  - Cefpodoxime, the deesterified part of the orally available cefpodoxime proxetil,  is active against most Enterobacteriaceae with MIC50 of 0.06 to 2 mg/l. Only Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains show MIC50 of 4 mg/l. Coagulase negative staphylococci have a MIC50 of 2, while Staphylococcus aureus strains have a MIC of 4 mg/l. In comparison to other orally available cephalosporins cefpodoxime is slightly less active than cefixime and cefotiam against gram-negative bacteria but more active than cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin. Against staphylococci the activity of cefpodoxime is comparable to that of cefotiam and cefuroxime and superior to cefaclor and cephalexin, while cefixime does not have sufficient activity against these species. Like all cephalosporins cefpodoxime has no activity against enterococci.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - The influence of clinical use of antibiotics and the sensitivity of strains isolated from postoperative infections--a comparison of nosocomial pathogens with strains isolated from the bacterial flora of patients.
AB  - In the present study, we investigated how the recent clinical use of antibiotics  have altered the antibiotic susceptibility of strains isolated from postoperative infections, especially Gram-negative rods. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, serogroup E strains accounted for about 20 per cent of postoperative infections, but were unable to be isolated from either the feces of patients on admission or from the appendix contents of patients with appendicitis. It therefore appeared that serogroup E strains were responsible for the nosocomial infections in our department. The strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup E, which we assumed to be nosocomial pathogens, acquired a high level of resistance to antibiotics soon after third-generation cephems became widely used. On the other hand, the antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and the serogroups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa other than E, which were considered to originate from the bacterial flora of patients, did not vary throughout the several years of the study period.
TI  - In vitro phagocytic interaction between Trichomonas vaginalis isolates and bacteria.
AB  - The phagocytic activity of 12 Trichomonas vaginalis isolates against both gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Lactobacillus spp.) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, 5 strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) was studied. Results showed that all the isolates were able to ingest Staphylococcus aureus to a variable degree, and almost all of them showed phagocytic activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, experiments with a restricted number of isolates of Trichomonas vaginalis showed that they phagocytized, often very effectively, human vaginal lactobacilli. Only in some cases was the addition of serum essential for bacteria ingestion. Phagocytic uptake of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae was not detectable under the experimental conditions used. It is concluded that phagocytosis may be involved in changes in vaginal biocenosis during the early stages of trichomoniasis.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206),  a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206), a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of 10 other agents against 1,222 clinical isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most active quinolones against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli; sparfloxacin had superior activity against gram-positive cocci in comparison with the activities of ciprofloxacin and the other quinolones tested (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, and pefloxacin). Among the inhibited strains, several were resistant to the tested beta-lactam antibiotics or to aminoglycosides. The activity of sparfloxacin was not influenced by the medium that was used; lowering of the pH to 5 had a marked effect on the MICs for two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the MBC of sparfloxacin was within 1 to 2 dilution steps of the MIC for the strains that were tested.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpirome in children].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810) was clinically evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 11 patients with ages from 4 months to 11 years with bacterial infection. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. CPR was administered to 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, a patient with pneumonia, a patient with tonsillitis, 2 patients with acute pharyngitis and a patient with suppurative parotitis at daily dosage levels ranging 55.5-91.7 mg/kg, divided into 3 using intravenous bolus injection or 30 minutes drip infusion. Clinical responses of the 11 patients were as follows: excellent; 8 patients, good; 2 patients, poor; 1 patient, hence the efficacy rate was 90.9%. 2. Neither clinical adverse reaction nor abnormal laboratory test value was observed except slight elevation of GOT and GPT in a patient and leukopenia in another. 3. MICs of CPR against 18 beta-lactamase producing strains isolated from patients were as follows. MIC against a strain of Staphylococcus aureus was 1.56 micrograms/ml, MICs against 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml, those against 3 out of 5 strains of Enterobacter cloacae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml and those against the remaining 2 strains were 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml. MICs against 2 out of 3 strains Acinetobacter lwoffi were 1.56 micrograms/ml, and that of the remaining 1 strain was 0.39 microgram/ml. MICs against 2 strains of Pseudomonas cepacia were 1.56 micrograms/ml. MICs against a strain of Pseudomonas putida and a strain of Citrobacter diversus were 0.78 and less than 0.025 microgram/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Comparison of silver sulfadiazine 1% with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% to silver sulfadiazine 1% alone in the prophylactic topical antibacterial treatment of burns.
AB  - Wound bacterial colonization in 118 patients treated with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1% applied daily to the burn wounds was compared to that of 135 comparable patients similarly treated with silver sulfadiazine 1%. With chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1%, colonization by Staphylococcus aureus was less frequent (38%) than with silver sulfadiazine (54%, p = 0.016). No statistical difference was found for colonization by Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Enterobacter cloacae. Washing of the wounds of 65 patients with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% during daily dressing changes was associated with reduced wound colonization by S. aureus (35% versus 51%, p = 0.03) and P. aeruginosa (8% versus 16%, p = 0.08) when compared to the 188 washed with nonantibacterial soap. Chlorhexidine, whether added to the topical agent silver sulfadiazine (chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2%) or in the bath soap (chlorhexidine gluconate 4%), decreased colonization by S. aureus.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously in a pharmacodynamic in vitro model.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated in an in vitro model by simulating its pharmacokinetics following a single 100 or 200 mg administration intravenously. The one compartment open model described by Grasso and coworkers was used for these experiments. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in the model were reproduced by calculations based on the concentration-time curve in human volunteers as reported by Wise and others. The maximum reduction of viable cell count for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus was from two-to three-orders of magnitude; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae from four to seven orders. A rapid killing was recorded both for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but the initial killing was more prolonged and more pronounced for the higher dosage. The last did not interfere with regrowth that occurred for all strains after eight hours.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  - Cefpodoxime, the active de-esterified molecule of the orally absorbable cephalosporin cefpodoxime proxetil, inhibits streptococci, Neisseria spp., and most Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC50 and/or MIC90 values of less than or equal to 2 mg/L; with regard to the latter family of bacteria, the MIC50 and/or MIC90 values of cefpodoxime are consistently greater than or equal to 4 mg/L for only Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii. The MIC50 of cedpodoxime for coagulase-negative staphylococci is greater than 2 mg/L, while the MIC for Staphylococcus aureus strains is 4 mg/L. In comparison with other orally absorbable cephalosporins, cefpodoxime is slightly less active than cefixime, cefetamet, and cefotiam against Gram-negative bacteria, but more active than cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cefalexin. Against staphylococci, the activity of cefpodoxime is comparable to that of cefotiam and cefuroxime, and superior to that of cefaclor, while cefixime and cefetamet have insufficient activity against these species. In common with other cephalosporins, cefpodoxime has no activity against enterococci. In vitro models simulating human serum cefpodoxime concentrations demonstrate that a dosage regimen of 200mg is probably sufficient to treat most infections. However, further study is needed to clarify whether infections due to bacteria such as S. aureus, with higher cefpodoxime MICs, can be treated with this dose regimen.
TI  - In vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, SCE2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  - The therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, SCE 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (MIC90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the MIC90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia spp. were most susceptible to SCE 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (MIC90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. For Citrobacter spp., Providencia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica MIC90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. Flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 2 and 8 mg/l). Morganella morganii and Hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (MIC90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (MIC90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. SCE 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) investigated (MIC90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). The oxacephems were the least active compounds against NFB. Cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 mg/l). Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). Latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. Flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Citrobacter perfringens. Synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa. Some ofloxacin and piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. Ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. Ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for S. aureus and E. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. Combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. Ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against P. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Fournier's gangrene: report of 3 cases].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. The pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. We report 3 cases of Fournier's gangrene. Case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. Case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. Case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and pain for 2 days. These 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. All 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. Blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially Bacteroids fragilis. Our pus cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in Case 1, Enterobacter cloacae in Case 2 and E. coli, B. fragilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Case 3. This disease is no longer a disease of young men. After 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. Before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. In these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of DQ-2556 and its stability to various beta-lactamases.
AB  - DQ-2556, a new cephalosporin, showed a broad antibacterial spectrum over Gram-positive and -negative organisms. The activity of DQ-2556 against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci and Enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of cefpirome, and superior to that of ceftazidime. DQ-2556 was almost as active as cefpirome against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was less active than ceftazidime. With the exception of Ps. aeruginosa, DQ-2556 was bactericidal against various organisms at either the MIC or twice the MIC. DQ-2556 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 2, 1 and 3 of Staphylococcus aureus, PBPs 3, 1A and 1B of Escherichia coli and PBPs 1A, 3 and 4 of Ps. aeruginosa. DQ-2556 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases, but was unstable to oxyiminocephalosporinases. The Km values of DQ-2556 for the cephalosporinases of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were only two- or three-fold higher than those of ceftazidime, indicating that DQ-2556 had a relatively high affinity for these enzymes compared with other recently developed cephalosporins. The MIC of DQ-2556 for Esch. coli increased four-fold in an OmpF-deficient mutant, indicating that the OmpF porin was one of the major routes for penetration of DQ-2556 into Esch. coli cells.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Microbial growth in parenteral nutrition. II. Effects of osmolality].
AB  - Study on the behaviour of five microorganisms in different formulations of Parenteral Nutrition (PN) different from each other with regard to osmolarity. The organisms investigated were Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC (12600), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047) y Candida albicans (LSH 3156 D). It was observed no direct relation between microbial growth and osmolarity in PN. C. albicans showed the best growth in all the formulations tested, followed by E. Cloacae. The number of the other microorganisms is reduced, and in general, except B. subtilis grow or are reduced in a lesser extension when the glucose solutions added are at 30 or 40%.
TI  - [Ecological changes in burn wound bacterial flora].
AB  - A comparative study of the ecology of the burn wound bacterial flora, during Jan. 1970 to Dec. 1971 (Group I) and Jan. 1985 to Dec. 1986 (Group II) was carried out. The incidence of Gram positive cocci was 40.70% in Group I versus 45.66% in Group II. That of Gram negative bacilli was 54.92% and 48.10% respectively. The occurrence of Ps. aeruginosa was markedly reduced, in Group I it reached 35.08% versus 11.26% in Group II (P less than 0.001). The incidence of Enterobacter aerogenes was significantly increased, in Group I it was only 3.69% but it accounted for 11.14% in Group II (P less than 0.001). Before 1972, K. pneumonia and E. cloacae were seldom found on burn wounds, in Group II, however, the incidence was 3.79% and 3.06% respectively. Acinetobacter anitratum occurred more often in Group II than in Group I, being 3.30% and 1.38% respectively (P less than 0.05). A total of 79 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from burn wounds, during Dec. 1986 to Nov. 1987. Among them Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 58 strains (73.4%) that is notable problem. In this centre 1% silver sulphadiazine has been used routinely since 1972 and third-generation cephalosporins have been used widely since 1983, there are the principle causes of the changing pattern of bacterial flora on the burn wounds.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new carbapenem LJC10,627.
AB  - In in vitro susceptibility tests the new carbapenem LJC10,627 showed potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except that most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains tested were found to be resistant to LJC10,627. LJC10,627 showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was active against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains which were resistant to ceftazidime and cefpirome. The Ki values of LJC10,627 for penicillinase Type I, cephalosporinase and oxyiminocephalosporinase were low, whereas the Ki value for L-1 enzyme from Xanthomonas maltophilia was high.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins).
AB  - A novel direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins) was achieved by treatment of 7 beta (6 beta)-[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1- ylidene)methylimino]cephem (penam) esters with N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)formamide, followed by deblocking with Girard reagent T to give the corresponding 7 alpha (6 alpha)-formamido-7 beta (6 beta)-amino derivatives. Three 7 alpha-formamidocephalosporins were prepared by the conventional N-acylation of 7 alpha-formamidocephem. All of them were resistant to beta-lactamases, showing similar MIC values against both of a pair of a beta-lactamase-producing strain and the corresponding non or low-producing strain of the same species of bacteria, when tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - Mechanism of action of lomefloxacin.
AB  - The inhibition of supercoiling activity of reconstituted Escherichia coli DNA gyrase by lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin was determined. The concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also measured. The kinetics of uptake of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin into whole cells of E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus NCTC 8532 and the induction of RecA in E. coli GC2241 were assayed. All strains had wild-type susceptibilities to quinolones. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% correlated with the MIC for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% for late-logarithmic-phase S. aureus also correlated with the MIC, unlike the data from early-logarithmic-phase cultures. E. coli and S. aureus showed a similar pattern of uptake kinetics of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin, indicating that the difference in the susceptibilities of the two species is probably due to different target site affinities. Essentially, lomefloxacin was less active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and had activity similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Since 1979, Ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. Their findings for the past year are reported below. A total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. Of this total, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and Gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). Taxonomically, Escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), Enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), Klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). Sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. E. faecalis was sensitive to parenteral imipenem (IPM) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. It was also sensitive to ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), which are new quinolones. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefuzonam (CZON) aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK) and arbekacin (HBK), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to dicloxacillin (MDIPC) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (CTM) which is a cephem, IPM, minocycline (MINO), and HBK. A fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (CEZ), OFLX and CPFX. 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to MDIPC which is a penicillin derivative, cephems CTM and CZON, IPM, HBK, clindamycin (CLDM) and MINO. Some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. E. coli was sensitive to CTM, CMX, latamoxef (LMOX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZON, and flomoxef (FMOX), all of which are second or third generation cephems. It was also sensitive to IPM, a carbapenem, carumonam (CRMN), a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. 5. K. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. CTM, CAZ, CZON, FMOX and cefixime, CRMN which is a monobactam, IPM, a carbapenem and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to CTM, cefmetazole cefoperazone (CPZ), and FMOX. 6. Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to CRMN which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. CEZ, CTM, CPZ and CAZ. 7. Enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and AMK which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to CPZ, CAZ and CZON, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, OFLX and CPFX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Combined effect of sulbactam/cefoperazone and other antibiotics against clinical isolates of multi-resistant strains. I. Effect of sulbactam against beta-lactams resistant strains and in vitro combined effect of sulbactam/cefoperazone with each of piperacillin, latamoxef, ceftazidime, fosfomycin and doxycycline].
AB  - We evaluated relationships between production of beta-lactamase and their resistances to beta-lactams, effect of sulbactam (SBT), a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against beta-lactam resistant strains, and combined effect of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) with other antibiotics against multi-resistant strains. Through these studies, we obtained the following results. 1. Most of the strains resistant to beta-lactams were beta-lactamase producers. 2. Relationships between the production of beta-lactamase and their resistances to beta-lactams indicate that their resistances generally were the highest in producers of both penicillinase (PCase) and cephalosporinase (CEPase), moderate in producers of either PCase or CEPase, and the lowest in beta-lactamase non-producers. Most of highly-resistant strains of MRSA appeared to be beta-lactamase non-producers though some exceptions were observed among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3. SBT showed good effect against PCase producers, moderate effect against producers of both PCase and CEPase, little effect against CEPase producers, and no effect against beta-lactamase non-producers. 4. Results of combined effect of SBT/CPZ with other antibiotics indicated that good synergism was obtained by combining SBT/CPZ with fosfomycin (FOM) or piperacillin against multi-resistant strains of Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, and S. marcescens, by combining SBT/CPZ with ceftazidime (CAZ) or FOM in methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and by combining SBT/CPZ with CAZ in P. aeruginosa. 5. Better synergism was obtained with the higher concentrations of antibiotics.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (AZT) were performed in neonates. The results are summarized as follows: A total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. AZT 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. Concomitantly, vancomycin (VCM) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (ABPC) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. Of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of AZT were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. All of the causative organisms (Escherichia coli in 3 and Enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with AZT. Neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by AZT was observed. MICs of AZT against 10 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 1, E. coli 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, E. cloacae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. As results, AZT showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against P. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Three-year experience with sonicated vascular catheter cultures in a clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - Using a quantitative sonication method, we cultured 1,681 consecutive vascular catheters submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory in a 36-month period. A total of 46% of the cultures were positive; the most common organisms isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (36.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), enterococci (10.0%), yeasts (9.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%), and Enterobacter species (4.4%). The frequencies of positive blood cultures within 48 h prior to a positive catheter culture result were as follows: Candida albicans (68.4%), S. aureus (60%), Enterobacter cloacae (42.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (32.1%), P. aeruginosa (27.7%), and enterococci (23.3%). The sonication method allowed quantification of the number of CFU removed from a catheter for between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. For catheter cultures in which greater than or equal to 10(2) CFU grew, a linear regression equation could be calculated: (risk of positive blood culture for the same organism) = 14 [log10 (number of organisms removed from the catheter)] -21 (r = 0.93). For catheter cultures in which less than 10(2) CFU grew, positive blood cultures for the same organism were strongly associated with a proven infection at a site distant from the catheter (P = 0.001) or probable contamination (S. epidermidis). Our findings indicate that this technique has considerable potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in the diagnosis of vascular catheter infections and for clinical investigations into the pathogenesis of these infections.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of piperacillin and tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates.
AB  - The effectiveness of a combination of the recently developed penam sulphone tazobactam with piperacillin was studied in clinical isolates with defined beta-lactamase production. The combination was highly effective against piperacillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1-producing Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris isolates. It was less effective against E. coli isolates producing the OXA-1 enzyme and marginally active against TEM-1-producing Klebsiella spp. isolates. The presence of tazobactam at a concentration of 10 mg/l markedly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentrations for piperacillin in most of the beta-lactamase-derepressed Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii isolates; however, this synergism was much less pronounced in beta-lactamase-derepressed Klebsiella spp. isolates. The selection frequency of resistant clones from clinical E. cloacae and C. freundii isolates could be markedly reduced by the addition of 10 mg/l tazobactam to the piperacillin-containing selective medium. Resistant clones could be obtained only from part of the wild-type strains at 2 or 4 times the MIC of piperacillin in the presence of tazobactam, whereas resistant clones could be selected up to 64 times the MIC of piperacillin without the addition of tazobactam. This aspect deserves attention with respect to the rapid selection of beta-lactamase-derepressed clones from nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Interaction of beta-lactamase inhibitors with various beta-lactamases.
AB  - The interaction of the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam with various plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases from clinical isolates was studied. In each case inhibition of enzyme activity was observed to be progressive, i.e. the balance of the equilibrium between active and inactivated enzyme required 5 min. As expected, the clavam compound exhibited high affinity to all penicillinases including the enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus, but the affinity was poor to cephalosporinases. The affinity of tazobactam-a new penam sulfone-was 20- to 100-fold higher than that of sulbactam; its KI values ranged from 1.1 x 10(-9) to 5.0 x 10(-8) mol/l for class III and V enzymes (Richmond's and Sykes' classification) and from 4.1 x 10(-6) to 3.5 x 10(-5) mol/l for class I enzymes. Moreover, the affinity of tazobactam to the Enterobacter cloacae 2240 enzyme did not decrease at lowered pH values, but increased at alkaline pH values probably due to its binding to SH groups in the active centre of the enzyme.
TI  - Influence of the addition of mineral salts on the inhibitory activity of strains  of the Arthrinium genus.
AB  - The influence which the addition of certain mineral salts has on the inhibiting activity of strains belonging to the Arthrinium genus was studied. The salts employed were AgNO3, FeCl2, MnCl2 and CuSO4, in concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/l, in the presence of Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. For B. subtilis and S. aureus greater inhibition was observed after the addition of FeCl2 (200 mg/l) and MnCl2 (10 mg/l). E. coli showed a greater sensibility in the presence of AgNO3 (200 mg/l) and CuSO4 (150 mg/l). Inhibition before Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens was not increased by the addition of any of the salts. The addition of MnCl2 at 10 mg/l concentration to the basal medium showed a considerable increase of inhibitory activity over Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. Activity for Aspergillus niger decreased when any of the salts were added to the medium.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of oral ofloxacin versus intravenous cefotaxime therapy  for serious skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - In a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 100 successive patients were enrolled with serious skin and soft-tissue infections, whose illnesses had precipitated an initial hospital admission or an extension of inpatient care. There were 93 evaluable patients who received either ofloxacin, 400 mg orally every 12 hours plus an intravenously administered placebo every eight hours, or cefotaxime, 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours plus an orally administered placebo every 12 hours. The average length of therapy was 12 days. Both patient groups had similar demographics and underlying conditions. Wound infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by abscess, cellulitis, and trophic ulcer. Multiple pathogens were commonly isolated from infected sites (1.4 pathogens/patient). The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus/Providencia spp., and Enterobacter spp. Persistence of the initial pathogen at the end of therapy was observed in 22.5 percent of the cefotaxime-treated group, but in only 10 percent of the ofloxacin-treated group. There was one clinical failure in the cefotaxime group, caused by a susceptible strain of Enterobacter cloacae, and there was one clinical failure in the ofloxacin group, in which the patient had an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus wound infection and subsequently developed a P. aeruginosa superinfection. Adverse experiences, including rash, insomnia, and nausea, occurred in 16 percent of the patients in each group. It was concluded that oral ofloxacin is as safe and efficacious as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of serious skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - 3-Sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems.
AB  - The stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. The known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds. Displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or DMF and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. The 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The following MIC's (microgram/mL) for the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: Staphylococcus aureus = 4, Streptococcus pyogenes = 1, Haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, Escherichia coli = 0.03, Enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, Proteus rettgeri = 0.25. The excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A microbial growth study in parenteral nutrition].
AB  - Study on the behaviour of five microorganisms in different formulations of parenteral nutrition (PN) different from each other with regard to the presence or absence of lipids and the addition of vitamins or oligoelements. The bacteria investigated were Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), as well as Candida albicans (LSH 3156 D). It was observed that C. albicans grew well in all types of PN tested, S. aureus and E. cloacae showed growth in the formulations containing lipids, whereas in those lacking lipids, the number of microorganisms remained practically uniform. P. aeruginosa remained essentially constant throughout the study and in all mixtures and B. subtilis was reduced with regard to the number of feasible organisms, due to the formation of spores. Finally, the addition of vitamins or oligoelements did not appear to determine a particular model of evolution in any of the species studied.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of meropenem and interactions with other antibiotics.
AB  - MICs of meropenem for selected clinical isolates of bacteria were determined. Killing curves were performed on strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Acinetobacter spp. A reduction of greater than or equal to 3 x log10 in viable cells was observed at 4 and 6 h of exposure to 4 and 8 x MIC, and this was usually maintained at 24 h (with a few exceptions for methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis and Ent. cloacae). At the MIC and twice the MIC regrowth tended to occur at 24 h although this varied from strain to strain. The interaction with other antibiotics was determined by the chequerboard technique. Usually an additive or synergistic effect was observed when meropenem or imipenem was used in combination with an aminoglycoside against Gram-negative species, while in a few cases antagonism occurred in combination with beta-lactams. Against Staph, aureus, MRSA and Staph, epidermidis synergism was usually obtained with combinations with teicoplanin or vancomycin and either synergism or addition with combinations with rifampicin, co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an  orally absorbed cephalosporin, with that of cephalexin and cefaclor. It inhabited Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.25 microgram/ml, sero groups B, C and G streptococci at 1 microgram/ml, and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 2 micrograms/ml. It was slightly more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. MDL 19,592 did not significantly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. strains (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). MDL 19,592 was not hydrolyzed by the plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1 of Klebsiella but was hydrolyzed by the TEM-3, Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase, and the chromosomal-mediated Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzymes.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - In bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (CPDX-PR, CS-807), the following results were obtained: 1. Antibacteriological activity Antibacteriological activity of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, cefroxadine (CXD), cefazolin (CEZ), cephalothin (CET) and amoxicillin (AMPC) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: Staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), Escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Antibacterial activities of CXD and CET, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. R-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except S. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than AMPC. Most frequent MIC values of R-3746 to S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. Against isolated strains of MRSA, MICs of R-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to MIC values of CCL and AMPC against these organisms. MIC values of R-3746 against CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were superior to MICs of other antibiotics, and the MIC50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. Against many isolated strains of E. cloacae MIC values of R-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC50 of R-3746 against E. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. Absorption and excretion Serum concentration and urinary excretion of CPDX (the active form of CPDX-PR) were studied upon single oral administration of CPDX-PR at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). The peak of serum concentration of CPDX was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of CPDX for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. As the average AUC's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates of CPDX for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, SM-7338.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at MICs of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. It was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. SM-7338 inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Group A, B, and C streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. There was no major inoculum size effect, and the MBCs were within a dilution of the MICs. SM-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid pH under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid beta-lactamases of TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, SHV-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, OXA-2, OXA-3, OXA-4, OXA-5, and OXA-7; Staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases P-99 and K-1; Morganella species; and Proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze SM-7338. The repeated transfer of organisms increased the MICs of SM-7338, as it did the MICs of imipenem.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulbactam in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Forty-three strains (beta-lactamase positive and negative) from the species of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for synergy between sulbactam and several beta-lactam antibiotics. Using a checkerboard method, synergy was observed with 10 to 55% of the beta-lactamase negative strains. Synergy was more frequent with the strains producing beta-lactamase. Using the killing curve method, synergy was also observed between sulbactam and beta-lactam antibiotics against some beta-lactamase negative strains. In addition, the regrowth of a resistant subpopulation was prevented by sulbactam.
TI  - The phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulata sp108 encodes an indigenous class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.37 kb DNA fragment derived from cloning a total DNA digest of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata sp108 was determined. The DNA codes for a beta-lactamase, a protein showing sequence similarity to the ampR protein of Enterobacter cloacae and an unidentified open reading frame. Hybridization experiments with a probe carrying DNA from within the beta-lactamase gene suggests a chromosomal location for the coding sequences in strain sp108 and in sp109, a penicillin-sensitive revertant of sp108 in which the enzyme is not inducible. A protein-sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the Rps. capsulata beta-lactamase indicates that it is a Class A enzyme and that its sequence can be aligned with those of the characterized beta-lactamases from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis and the Escherichia coli plasmid (R-TEM enzyme), with only a few insertions or deletions. The corresponding DNA sequence is, however, characteristically rhodopseudomonad, suggesting that it is not a recently transposed gene.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of a new broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin, BMY-28232, and its prodrug esters.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, BMY-28232 (7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-[ (Z)-1- propenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid), was compared with those of cefuroxime and BMY-28488, the 3-vinyl congener of BMY-28232, against 899 bacteria including strains resistant to newer cephalosporins. BMY-28232 displayed potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with high stability to various types of beta-lactamase. Its acetoxyethyl ester (BMY-28271) and pivaloyloxymethyl ester (BMY-28257) were well absorbed after oral administration to mice and rats. Both esters were metabolized to BMY-28232 and mainly excreted in urine. Oral bioavailability of both prodrug esters (60 to 70%) was better than that of cefuroxime axetil (46%) and gave excellent therapeutic efficacy against gram-positive- and gram-negative-bacterial infections in mice. Oral 50% protective doses (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) of 0.65 and 0.72 for Staphylococcus aureus Smith, 0.9 and 1.2 for Escherichia coli Juhl, 1.6 and 1.6 for Proteus vulgaris, and 18.9 and 14.3 for Enterobacter cloacae were obtained for BMY-28271 and BMY-28257, respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combinations of FCE 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. The combination of FCE 22101 and gentamicin against Streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. Against Enterobacter cloacae FCE 22101 had MICs of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the MICs were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin and FCE 22101 showed only addition against Enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of FCE 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against Citrobacter freundii. With Serratia spp. FCE 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but FCE 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. Similar results were obtained with strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providencia spp. FCE 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against Ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. In general the combination of FCE 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.
TI  - In-vitro activity of the penem, FCE 22101, and tentative interpretive criteria for disc susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of two penems (FCE 22101 and SCH 34343) were compared to  those of a carbapenem (imipenem), a monobactam (aztreonam) and three cephalosporins (cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime). FCE 22101 displayed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including anaerobic bacteria. Imipenem and aztreonam, however, were a little more potent against susceptible species. FCE 22101 was bactericidal against 14 of 18 isolates tested; one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive), Staph. aureus (methicillin resistant) and Streptococcus faecalis were not killed by FCE 22101. For disc diffusion tests, a 10 micrograms FCE 22101 disc is tentatively recommended with zones of less than or equal to 13 mm for resistant (MIC greater than 8.0 mg/l) and greater than or equal to 17 mm for susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 4.0 mg/l). Those criteria need to be reevaluated when additional pharmacokinetic information and clinical experience have been gathered.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22101 and other beta-lactam antibiotics against experimental genital infections in the rat and mouse.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of the parenterally administered penem FCE 22101, cefuroxime and ampicillin were compared in an experimental model of genital infections in progesterone-treated virgin rats and normal female mice. Treatment with FCE 22101 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13709, Escherichia coli G and Enterobacter cloacae 1321 E, as compared with untreated controls. Against Staph. aureus ampicillin was slightly more active than cefuroxime, which showed equivalent activity to FCE 22101, while against Esch. coli and Ent. cloacae cefuroxime and ampicillin were less active than FCE 22101. The activity of the antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains was also tested and here FCE 22101 exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - FCE 22101 and FCE 22891: in-vitro antibacterial activity at concentrations simulating human plasma levels following intravenous, intramuscular and oral administration.
AB  - The plasma concentrations of FCE 22101 observed following slow intravenous infusions (1 and 4 h), intramuscular injection and after oral administration of the prodrug FCE 22891 were simulated in a glass chamber containing bacterial cultures. The bacteria used were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13709, Staph. aureus 2101 (methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043, Escherichia coli ATCC 12407, Enterobacter cloacae 1321E and Ent. cloacae P99 (cefazolin-resistant). Addition of FCE 22101 was found to result in a reduction in number of all bacterial strains except Str. faecium, with which only bacteriostasis was observed.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of the new semisynthetic cephalosporin cefpirome.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad antibacterial spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefpirome was more active than not only cefotaxime and ceftazidime but also cefotiam. Against gram-negative bacteria, especially, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, it was also more active than the other antibiotics tested, but against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ceftazidime. Cefpirome was stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid mediated beta-lactamases and was stable to the action of chromosomal cephalosporinases. But it was slightly hydrolyzed by both Rms 213 mediated penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinases produced by Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas cepacia. When cefpirome was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability and antibacterial activity of cefpirome alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefpirome (HR810), a new cephalosporin, was compared with that of other "third-generation" cephalosporins, as well as cefuroxime, piperacillin and gentamicin. Cefpirome was the most active beta-lactam antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90 for Enterobacteriaceae was always less than 0.5 ml/l except for Enterobacter species. The MIC90 against Pseudomonas species was 2 mg/l, which was equal to that of ceftazidime and gentamicin. Cefpirome was also more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus. A relatively high frequency of synergy was observed when cefpirome was combined with aminoglycosides against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. No antagonism was detected. This antibiotic was very stable to both plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. It was more resistant to Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzyme than ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefotetan. Its stability to the Klebsiella K1 beta-lactamase was more than that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone but slightly less than that of ceftazidime and latamoxef. MBC90 values for cefpirome were generally less than twice the corresponding MIC values.
TI  - [Activity of cefpirome against bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients].
AB  - The activity of cefpirome (HR 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in Buenos Aires. Its activity against Gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. In terms of MIC50 and MIC90 (mg/l) it was as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; Escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; Serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; Enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0. Cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against P. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. Activity of norfloxacine against Gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. Cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against Streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (less than 0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). Like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  - Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Selection of resistance to gentamicin and netilmicin in the faecal flora following prophylaxis for colo-rectal surgery.
AB  - The selection of aminoglycoside-resistant bowel flora, following the administration of either gentamicin or netilmicin in combination with metronidazole for prophylaxis, during colo-rectal surgery in 88 patients has been examined. Both antibiotic regimens resulted in the selection of an aminoglycoside-resistant flora in a total of 57 (65%) of patients: in half of the patients there was a net gain in the aminoglycoside-resistant flora, and in 13 (15%) one aminoglycoside-resistant strain present prior to prophylaxis was displaced by another following operation. Three patients (3%) lost aminoglycoside-resistant strains after prophylaxis. Most of the resistant organisms selected were considered to be of little importance as potential pathogens, at least in the short term. In only a small minority (5%) of patients were aminoglycoside-resistant enterobacteria isolated. Aminoglycoside-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. Of the resistant enterobacteria, only one strain, an isolate of Enterobacter cloacae selected in a patient receiving gentamicin, carried a resistance determinant which was self-transmissible to Escherichia coli.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylene analogs of penicillin G.
AB  - The penam nucleus can assume two conformations; these are designated open and closed. The synthetic (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams can be regarded as analogs of the open and closed conformations, respectively. It has been shown that the beta-methylenepenams are essentially inactive, suggesting that the closed conformation of penams is also inactive. In this study, we investigated a series of beta-lactams, all of which contained phenylacetamido side chains: penicillin G, the (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams, and the 3-acetoxymethyl- and 3-methylcephalosporins. The alpha-methylenepenam and penicillin G were the most active compounds, while the beta-methylene isomer was only poorly active. Results with permeability mutants suggested that the alpha-methylene compound penetrated the outer membrane somewhat more readily than penicillin G did. The intrinsic potency of the alpha-methylenepenam appeared to be similar to that of penicillin G, on the basis of their affinities for penicillin-binding proteins and their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized Escherichia coli, while the beta-methylene analog had very poor intrinsic potency. The alpha-methylene analog was about 10-fold more efficient (Vmax/Km) than penicillin G as a substrate for the cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, but it was about 40-fold less efficient with penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the active conformation of penams is the open conformation and suggest that the position in space of the carboxyl group relative to the beta-lactam carbonyl is an important determinant of cephalosporinlike character, as distinct from penicillinlike character.
TI  - Cefotetan: a review of the microbiologic properties and antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - Cefotetan (formerly ICI 156834 and YM09330) is a 7-methoxy cephalosporin possessing some advantageous antimicrobial spectrum, safety, and pharmacokinetic characteristics compared with other so-called second-generation cephalosporins. The published literature was reviewed and the cefotetan quantitative susceptibility testing data from nearly 31,000 isolates was tabulated. Against 15,769 enteric bacilli, cefotetan was observed to have a potency and spectrum more closely resembling a third-generation cephalosporin and markedly superior to cefoxitin. The mean of all MIC 90s reported for the Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.06 to 13 micrograms/ml except for citrobacter species, E. cloacae, Enterobacter species, and C. freundii. The mean MIC 50 for all 22 recorded species was in the susceptible range. Cefotetan was very effective against B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and pathogenic Neisseria species. However, cefotetan and cefoxitin were not active against Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and some rarely isolated species. Cefotetan was moderately active against the staphylococci (mean MIC 50, 7.6 to 26 micrograms/ml) and streptococci (mean MIC 50, 0.9 to 6.6 micrograms/ml). The coagulase-negative staphylococcus species generally had higher cefotetan and cefoxitin minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with the S. aureus isolates. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant to cefotetan. The enterococci, JK group diphtheroids, Corynebacterium species, and L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant. A review of 4,751 strict anaerobes showed cefotetan to have a very comparable activity and spectrum to cefoxitin. The 1,291 B. fragilis strains had a mean MIC 50 and MIC 90 of 5.4 and 23 micrograms/ml, respectively. These values were slightly superior to cefoxitin when tested in parallel. More elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations were observed for other B. fragilis group species for cefoxitin and cefotetan. The mean cefotetan MIC 90 for all other anaerobic bacteria except the Eubacterium species and Lactobacillus species predict favorable clinical efficacy. The beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan is very similar to that of other 7-methoxy cephalosporins. Cefotetan also inhibits Type Ia cephalosporinases with high enzyme affinity and is an inducer of these beta-lactamases, although cefotetan is not rapidly hydrolyzed. Synergy between cefotetan and numerous other antibiotics has been reported, but antagonism has also been occasionally observed.
TI  - [In vitro synergy between cefotaxime and its main metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime].
AB  - In vitro synergistic interaction between cefotaxime (CTX) and its main metabolite, desacetyl-cefotaxime (DCTX), against 7 species of clinical isolates (23-27 strains per species) was examined. Complete or partial synergy was noted with a 1:1 combination of CTX and DCTX against 22-78% of the Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas cepacia and Enterobacter cloacae isolates examined. Antagonistic effects of the drugs appeared against 11% of Proteus vulgaris and 4% of Serratia marcescens. When combined at various ratios by the checkerboard method and tested against B. fragilis, CTX and DCTX were found to act synergistically, and no antagonism occurred. The combined use of CTX and DCTX exhibited strong bactericidal activity against B. fragilis and inhibited bacterial regrowth. An experiment with concentrations of CTX and DCTX simulating human serum levels after intravenous administration also showed that the coexistence of DCTX augmented bactericidal activity of CTX against B. fragilis and brought inhibitory effects on bacterial regrowth. It is presumed from the present results that clinically applied CTX would have more potent effects than expected from in vitro sensitivity test data.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of cefotetan-aminoside combinations].
AB  - Bactericidal activity of cefotetan-gentamicin combinations was studied on 6 bacterial strains: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. vulgaris, P. stuarti. Time kille curves technic was performed with final concentrations of cefotetan: 4 at 32 mg/l, and of gentamicin: 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 8 mg/l and with an 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum. Cefotetan at 4 mg/l was not able to obtain a 0.01% (percentage of survivors) bactericidal activity before 24 h. The combination cefotetan-gentamicin (0.25 to 2 mg/l according to the strains) were bactericidal (0.01% of survivors) before 24 h: 1 to 6 h according to the strains, more rapidly than with gentamicin alone at the same concentration. This more rapid bactericidal activity obtained by cefotetan-gentamicin combination seems to indicate this combination in the treatment of severe infections in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone, inhibited the majority of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was 4-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and 2-fold less active than ofloxacin. Cefotaxime and imipenem-resistant isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited. Temafloxacin inhibited Neisseria, Branhamella, and Haemophilus species at less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Clostridium spp. were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - Comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. With regard to ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. Cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus ssp. isolates. All beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against Acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. Both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against Staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the TEM or OXA enzymes. Resistance to both agents was observed in Enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. However, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class IIIa enzyme form Proteus vulgaris was marginal. In methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of antiseptics].
AB  - In the study, the antimicrobial activities of 7.5% povidone-iodine, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, 1.5% chlorhexidine gluconate, 1.5% chlorhexidine gluconate with cetrimide mixture, 10% benzalconium chloride, dust detergent and soap as well as changes in activity in due course of time have been investigated. It has been observed that the effect of germicides on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Candida strains increased in time. Soap had no germicidal effect. The difference between the of antiseptics on the residuent flora of the hands immediately and those two hours later was found to be statistically insignificant.
TI  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing of broad-spectrum antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. Ten isolates each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. The isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. The most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and 61%, respectively. The highest synergistic activity was against Enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the S. aureus isolates. A relatively low synergistic activity was noted against P. aeruginosa. No case of antagonism was observed. Subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to MIC concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. Netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of desacetylcefotaxime and the interaction with its parent compound, cefotaxime.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and its major metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, against 178 strains (of 10 species) were assessed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC50 and MIC80), and were compared with those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. The activity of desacetylcefotaxime was several times less than that of cefotaxime against almost all of the species tested. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC80 values of desacetylcefotaxime were higher than those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. The antibacterial potency of desacetylcefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia was superior to that of cefoperazone and ceftazidime, and comparable with the activities of the latter compounds against the other 4 Gram-negative species. Partial synergy was demonstrated in the activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against most of the strains examined. Antagonism was observed in activity against 2 of 18 strains of M. morganii. In general, desacetylcefotaxime enhances the potency of its parent compound, cefotaxime, when they coexist. Intravenous infusion of cefotaxime 1 g over a period of 1 hour resulted in mean peak serum concentrations of 48.5 mg/L of cefotaxime and 6.5 mg/L of desacetylcefotaxime at the end of the infusion. The mean elimination half-life in beta-phase of cefotaxime was 0.8 hour and that of desacetylcefotaxime was 2 hours.
TI  - Comparison of 1% silver sulfadiazine with and without 1% chlorhexidine digluconate for topical antibacterial effect in the burnt infected rat.
AB  - The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (CDSS) was compared with 1% silver sulfadiazine (SS) alone to assess the antibacterial effect of a once-daily application of the therapies on an experimental rat model with a 20% full-thickness burn wound seeded with 10(8) microorganisms originally isolated from infected wounds of burn patients. Separate series evaluated Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Streptococcus faecalis. The mean concentration of all four organisms recovered after one week from biopsy specimens of full-thickness eschar was less in the CDSS-treated animals compared with the SS-treated animals. Microbial invasion into subjacent muscle was less frequent in animals seeded with S faecalis, while the mean concentration of bacteria recovered from muscle of animals seeded with S aureus and E cloacae was less in animals treated with CDSS compared with those treated with SS (P less than 0.05). The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine increased the antibacterial effectiveness of the latter agent.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - [Detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis].
AB  - A total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. Beta-Lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. The beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 Escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of Enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. The isolation rate of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, CGP 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, SCH 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. CGP 31608 was active against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were more resistant to the penem. Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.
TI  - Kinetics and mechanism of the serine beta-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of depsipeptides.
AB  - Steady-state kinetic parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of a series of acyclic depsipeptides (ester analogues of acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine peptides) catalyzed by representative class C (Enterobacter cloacae P99) and class A (Bacillus cereus I, TEM-2, and Staphylococcus aureus PC1) beta-lactamases. The best of these substrates, and the one most used in this work, was m-[[(phenylacetyl)-glycyl]oxy]benzoic acid, whose rates of cleavage could be followed spectrophotometrically. The P99 enzyme also catalyzed the methanolysis of these substrates in aqueous methanol solutions. Quantitative evaluation of the effects of methanol on the kinetics of the competing hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions, and on the product distribution, supports a reaction mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate whose formation is rate-determining under conditions of substrate saturation. Consideration of the variation of these kinetic parameters with the structure of the depsipeptides and comparison with the analogous parameters for bicyclic beta-lactam substrates suggest that a variety of substrate binding modes exist on this enzyme. The class A enzymes, B. cereus beta-lactamase I and the TEM-2 beta-lactamase, catalyze depsipeptide and benzylpenicillin hydrolyses but not methanolysis. The acyl-enzyme derived from both types of substrate is thus shielded from external nucleophiles; the shielding is therefore not an effect, direct or indirect, of the thiazolidinyl group in the penicilloyl-enzyme. The class A beta-lactamase of the PC1 plasmid of S. aureus is distinctly different from the above two representatives of that class, in that it does catalyze methanolysis of depsipeptides (but not of benzylpenicillin). The methanolysis kinetics suggest that deacylation is rate-determining at saturation, a conclusion supported by the demonstration of an intermediate during the hydrolysis of m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]oxy]benzoate, subsequent to leaving-group departure. The beta-lactamases have thus been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of specific depsipeptides with comparable facility to that demonstrated by D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases. The former enzymes, however, differ in being unable to cleave the analogous peptides.
TI  - [Epidemiologic studies of the microbial colonization of severely burned patients].
AB  - Bacteria isolated between 1/1/1983 and 12/31/1984 from the burns of 122 patients  in a burns unit at the Ruhr-Universitat Bochum were studied. Grampositive bacteria were predominant in colonizing the burn wounds (62.5% of all strains isolated). In the patients with more than 40% of total body surface area (TBSA) burn, isolation of Staph aureus was most frequent. The exogenous colonization rate with Staph. aureus was 86%. Coagulase negative Staphylococci were identified in 89.6% of all patients (71.4% of the patients with more than 40% TBSA burn). There was a constant decline in detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the second half of 1983. Microbial sensitivity testing was performed in 834 cases. Gramnegative strains of bacteria resistant to Ampicillin, Mezlocillin, Piperacillin and Ticarcillin were found in 10 up to 97% of the tested strains. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus and Enterobacter cloacae usually displayed a wide resistant pattern. Some strains were resistant as to 16 antibiotics. The incidence of multiresistant Staph. aureus was studied. The time course of multiresistance was paralleled by the incidence of a 6-fold resistance to Benzylpenicillin, Oxacillin, Tetracyclin(T), Gentamycin(G), Erythromycin(E), and Sulfadiacin(S). The probability of simultaneous resistance to 2 of the 4 antibiotics (T, G, E, S) ranged between 0.7 and 0.98. 98 out of 336 Staph. aureus isolates showed a simultaneous resistance to T, G, E and S (29%).
TI  - Proficiency testing of water microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands.
AB  - In a 3-year period, four series of simulated water samples containing selected test strains were distributed to more than 50 laboratories in The Netherlands for bacteriological testing. Participating laboratories examined the samples by enrichment or membrane filtration methods, or both, for total coliform organisms, thermotolerant coliform organisms, faecal streptococci and standard plate counts (37 degrees and 22 degrees C) according to Dutch standard methods. The results were quantitatively satisfactory: the distribution of positive and negative results with subsamples conformed to stochastic variation; the standard deviation of membrane or plate counts was usually in the range which may be expected from a Poisson distribution, and there was good correspondence between average counts in participating laboratories and those expected from controls in the organizing laboratory. Problems of a qualitative nature were frequently encountered, however. Among them were a false positive response with a strain of Enterobacter cloacae in the thermotolerant coliform test; a false positive result with Clostridium perfringens in enrichment tests for total or thermotolerant coliform organisms and false positive results with Micrococcus varians in the faecal streptococcus test by membrane filtration. It is concluded that quality assessment should be a consistent activity in water microbiology laboratories. For this purpose, stable and well characterized reference materials are needed.
TI  - Treatment of combined immunodeficiency with thymic extract (Thymostimulin).
AB  - A 14-day-old Chinese male baby was admitted with extensive skin lesions. A wound  culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans and a blood culture grew group A beta-Streptococcus hemolyticus. The patient's lymphocyte counts were low and his lymphocytes were unable to produce IgG and IgA in vitro. The immunoglobulin-bearing cell studies also failed to demonstrate IgG and IgA bearing cells. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, and T cell subsets were at very low levels. Lymphoproliferative response to mitogens was also poor. Migration inhibitory factor production to Candida antigen was also decreased. The initial lymph node biopsy demonstrated no follicular formation and extensive depletion of lymphocytes in both thymic-dependent and thymic-independent areas. After Thymostimulin (a specific bovine thymic extract, TP-1) treatment, the second lymph node biopsy demonstrated germinal centers containing IgA-bearing cells and IgM-bearing cells and, subsequently, cortical and medullary differentiation. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM became detectable at low levels and IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-bearing lymphocytes appeared in the peripheral blood. This also correlated with in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, T cell subsets and lymphoproliferative response to mitogens increased gradually after thymostimulin therapy. This investigation demonstrated the therapeutic effectiveness of Thymostimulin in combined immunodeficiency both histologically and immunologically and the successful reconstitution of B cell function that did not require continued therapy.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Clinical study on effects of cefmetazole on severe infections accompanied by hematologic diseases].
AB  - Severe infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic conditions were treated with cefmetazole (CMZ). Subject diseases mainly consisted of acute leukemia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia; combined infections were septicemia, pneumonia, fever of an undetermined origin, etc. As for causative organisms found in cases that could be examined, Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae were isolated, as was Staphylococcus aureus. In general, 4 g of CMZ divided into 2 administrations was given per day through intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion. On the basis of the judgement criteria for effectiveness established by Takaku et al., the efficacy rate in this study was found to be 68%, including 2 cases that showed excellent responses to treatment of infections caused by S. aureus. Cases that showed pyretolysis within 4 days had over 1,000/microliter of neutrophils, while cases with less than 1,000/microliter showed no pyretolysis. No hepatorenal dysfunctions related to the treatment with CMZ were seen as side effects except increases of transaminase in 1 case. These results indicate that CMZ is a useful drug for the treatment of infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic condition.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - [Etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  - The authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between May 1982 and December  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. Eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. Pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 Proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. A comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. Laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. Management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.
TI  - In-vitro activity of two new quinolone antimicrobial agents, S-25930 and S-25932  compared with that of other agents.
AB  - S-25930 and S-25932, two new 4-quinolones, were compared to ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, trimethoprim, and ampicillin. S-25930 and S-25932 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, usually differing only two-fold. The MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 8 mg/l for S-25930 and 16 mg/l for S-25932, compared to MICs of 1 to 8 for the other four quinolones. Both drugs inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii resistant to cefotaxime and Klebsiella species resistant to gentamicin and trimethoprim. The MICs90 were 0.125 and 0.25 mg/l against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and were superior to the MICs of other quinolones; activity against haemolytic streptococci at 1-2 mg/l was also superior. S-25930 and S-25932 showed rapid bactericidal activity at the MBC concentration and both agents showed post-antibiotic suppression of growth of bacteria. The agents were active in acid medium, but activity was reduced by magnesium at 9 mM. A stepwise increase in resistance was produced by serial passage in increasing concentrations of drug.
TI  - Co-infection or early superinfection of pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - Two cases of co-infection or very early superinfection of pneumococcal pneumonia  with Staphylococcus aureus in one case, and Enterobacter cloacae in the other, are reported. The two patients were not fully immunocompetent, had leukopenia and a mild intravascular coagulation, and were bacteremic. Mixed infection probably accounted for the lethal outcome because initial antibiotherapy was only directed against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Accurate bacteriologic methods are required to delineate contaminating and infecting pathogens when another bacteria is found in initial bronchial samples of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, and the antibiotherapy might be directed against the two pathogens until quantitative bacteriologic results would be available, especially in old and debilitated patients. The incidence of mixed infection in pneumococcal pneumonia seems low.
TI  - Worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in Japan, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, and Hungary. Standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. Susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. Minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. The susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for Escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for Enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Teicoplanin for therapy of gram-positive infections in neutropenic patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 20 febrile neutropenic patients as additional treatment for suspected Gram-positive infections after inadequate response to initial empiric ceftazidime monotherapy. Five patients with primary septicaemia, four with secondary septicaemia, 12 with localized infections and three with pyrexia of unknown origin were treated with teicoplanin (200 mg bolus intravenously, once daily after a 400 mg loading dose), whilst ceftazidime (2 g, 8-hourly, 30 min infusions) was continued. Four patients were unassessable (tuberculous, viral, protocol violation, and non-infectious pyrexial episode). Clinical cure for the combination was achieved in 11 or the 16 assessable cases (69%). Ten of the eleven (91%) bacteriologically confirmed infections were cured after addition of teicoplanin. Three strains of Staphylococcus aureus, four of Staphylococcus epidermidis (two methicillin resistant), and three strains of Streptococcus faecalis were isolated from successfully treated patients. One patient with Aerococcus and Enterobacter cloacae infection only improved after addition of erythromycin. One superinfection occurred with signs of interstitial pneumonitis in a patient following bone marrow transplantation. Neither ototoxicity nor nephrotoxicity occurred during treatment. A transient rise of liver transaminases was observed in four patients, but was attributable to teicoplanin in only one case. It is concluded that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent in neutropenic patients with infections due to Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Pericarditis in the course of acute leukemia.
AB  - Among 140 patients with acute leukemia (AL) diagnosed according to FAB criteria,  pericarditis was diagnosed clinically in 5 of them. They were 2 women and 3 men with different types of AL (L2-in one, M2-in one, M3-in one and M4-in two persons). It occurred in one patient at the onset of the disease and was associated with hyperuricemia, in another one--in complete remission, in the third--during partial remission, and in remaining two patients--during induction therapy. In all patients pericarditis was manifested by fever up to 38-40 degrees C, tachycardia and pericardial friction, in 3-heart silhouettes were enlarged. The ECG revealed mainly depression of ST segments. In 1 case only ECG pattern was typical of pericarditis. Clinically the symptoms of right ventricle failure predominated in 3 and of septic shock--in 2 patients. The etiologic factors were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 X, Enterobacter cloacae 1 X, tuberculosis infection 1 X and hyperuricemia and Enterobacter sepsis 1 X. Pericarditis was favourably influenced by treatment with antibiotics, cardiaca and diuretics in 4 patients. One patient died of a sepsis. In no case the patient's death was attributable to pericarditis. The results of postmortem examinations in 79 cases of AL has revealed three additional cases of pericarditis due to tuberculosis infection, Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and aspergillosis.
TI  - [Enzymologic aspect of piperacillin combinations].
AB  - Like all penicillins, piperacillin exhibits some susceptibility to beta-lactamases of the penicillinase type, including those produced by Staphylococcus aureus and the TEM, OXA and CARB enzymes isolated from Gram-negative bacilli. Piperacillin is very slightly hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases, which makes it similar to 3rd generation cephalosporins. When tested with Enterobacter cloacae GN 5797 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NTC 8303, two strains which produce inducible cephalosporinases, piperacillin had moderate inductive activity compared to cefoxitin, a potent inducer. Induction was very low with Enterobacter, but the drug was slightly more sensitive to Pseudomonas. Inhibition of this type of beta-lactamase synthesis was very strong when piperacillin was combined with amikacin and weaker when it was combined with pefloxacin. The piperacillin-amikacin combination prevented the development of piperacillin-resistant mutants of Enterobacter and Pseudomonas and, probably, of all Gram-negative bacilli. In our tests, the piperacillin-pefloxacin combination was of interest only against Enterobacter, and probably against all enterobacteria, since Pseudomonas mutants that resist pefloxacin are fairly easily obtained in vitro.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  - The bactericidal effect (BE) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (PAE) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. Both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the MIC value. The BE and the PAE of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. Imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high BE and PAE values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. PAE is low or non-existent for Gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.
TI  - In vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and beta-lactamase stability of RS-533, a novel carbapenem.
AB  - RS-533 is a novel carbapenem antibiotic. Its activity was compared with that of imipenem and the new cephalosporins, aztreonam, piperacillin, and tobramycin. RS-533 had activity comparable to that of imipenem, inhibiting the majority of the Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, staphylococci, and Bacteroides species at concentrations of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. RS-533 inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefoperazone, but RS-533 did not inhibit all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas maltophilia. It inhibited tobramycin-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RS-533 was stable against attack by common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and was an effective inhibitor of many beta-lactamases.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of imipenem.
AB  - The beta-lactamase stability and interactions of imipenem were analysed in comparison with those of cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, piperacillin and penicillin G for a set of representative beta-lactamases. These enzymes included penicillinases such as those obtained from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (TEM-1 and similar enzymes) (group A); cephalosporinases produced by Esch. coli (Amp C type), Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (group B); and beta-lactamases produced by Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis and with a high hydrolytic activity for the newer cephalosporins (group C). Enzymes of group A were demonstrated to be highly active against penicillins and also against the early cephalosporins; enzymes of group B showed hydrolytic activity for all other tested compounds, including the newer cephalosporins and cephamycins, but not imipenem, whereas enzymes of group C were highly active against the new cephalosporins but not against cephamycins and imipenem. In conclusion, imipenem shows a moderate affinity for all these enzymes but no detectable hydrolysis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - 7 alpha-formylamino substituent confers beta-lactamase-inactivating potency on 1-oxacephalosporins.
AB  - 7 alpha-Formylamino-1-oxacephalosporins 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-[2- (methylaminocarbonyl)amino-2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H -tetra zol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (F1) and 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-(2-[(4-ethyl-2,3-dioxopiperazine-1- yl)carbonylamino]-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetr azol-5-yl) thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (F2) were stable against penicillinases and, moreover, inactivated cephalosporinases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae. Extensive studies of the inactivation of cephalosporinase of P. aeruginosa showed that it resulted from the formation of a transiently stable enzyme-compound complex. The 7 alpha-formylamino substituent was involved in the enzyme inactivation, because 7 alpha-methoxy congeners did not inactivate the enzyme. The number of compound molecules required for inhibition of an enzyme molecule was found to be 36 for F1 and 5.5 for F2, which suggests that the pathway to the complex formation branched off the hydrolysis pathway. Half-lives of the complexes were 400 min for F1 and 260 min for F2. 7 alpha-Formylamino compounds F1 and F2 had antibacterial activities similar to those of 7 alpha-methoxy congeners against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, whereas they were less active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The conclusion was that the 7 alpha-formylamino substituent conferred the ability to inactivate cephalosporinase on the 1-oxacephalosporins tested, without much impairment of their antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in a general medicine department. Comments on cases collected over 3 years].
AB  - Urinary infections often complicate the clinical course of hospitalised patients  especially those with immunological diseases or under antibiotic treatment for other infectious pathologies. Urethral catheterisation is also a well known cause of such infections. The problem of urinary infections was examined in a general medical division. Over a three year period (1982-84), 384 urinary tract infections (UTI) with one infecting organism and 21 UTI with two bacterial species in urine cultures were found. UTI was more often found to be caused by gram negative than gram positive bacilli in both catheterised and non-catheterised patients and E. Coli accounted for most infections. Pseudomonas, Serratia and Acinetobacter were only found in catheterised patients and Enterobacter cloacae almost exclusively so. Among gram-positive bacilli, Enterococcus was the most common. Staphylococcus aureus was rare but created major pathogenetic and therapeutic problems. The results are discussed with particular reference to the high incidence of Escherichia coli and the significance of the different distribution of Pseudomonas, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter cloacae between catheterised and non-catheterised patients. Finally the pathogenic and therapeutic problems of UTI caused by more than one germ are considered.
TI  - Combination therapy: a way to limit emergence of resistance?
AB  - The ability of antibiotic combinations to limit the emergence of resistance during therapy was evaluated in a murine model. Peritonitis was produced by injecting a mixture containing 10(8) colony-forming units of bacteria and sterilized talcum into the peritoneum. Two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was administered subcutaneously. The next day, peritoneal bacterial populations were analyzed on Szybalski's gradients. Acquired resistance was recorded when there was at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with untreated animals. No resistance emerged after amikacin monotherapy (15 mg/kg); however, resistance was frequently observed after monotherapy with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) or pefloxacin (25 mg/kg). Resistance to ceftriaxone and pefloxacin emerged, respectively, in 15 percent and 83 percent of animals with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 71 percent and 54 percent with Enterobacter cloacae, 0 percent and 83 percent with Serratia marcescens, 25 percent and 100 percent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 0 percent with both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In mice with K. pneumoniae or E. cloacae infections, any dual combination of amikacin, pefloxacin, and ceftriaxone produced less acquired resistance than did monotherapy. In these animals, the combination of ceftriaxone and pefloxacin abolished all resistance, whereas the combinations of amikacin plus ceftriaxone or amikacin plus pefloxacin reduced the frequency of resistance by more than half. In animals with P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens infections, resistance to pefloxacin diminished or disappeared after treatment with the combinations of pefloxacin plus ceftriaxone or pefloxacin plus amikacin. However, combinations with ceftriaxone resulted in more frequent resistance to ceftriaxone than did ceftriaxone alone. This was the case in P. aeruginosa infections treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (p less than 0.01), and in S. marcescens infections treated with ceftriaxone plus pefloxacin (p less than 0.05). Despite these certain notable exceptions, our data confirm that in most cases combination therapy does limit the emergence of resistance.
TI  - The activity of BMY 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio C-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. BMY 28142 was the most active agent tested against the Enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. The in-vitro activity of BMY 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the Enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 inhibited many Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. BMY 28142 was more active than imipenem against Proteus, Providencia and Morganella species. Ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than BMY 28142 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. BMY 28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. BMY 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. BMY 28142 did not inhibit most Bacteroides species. BMY 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to Enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the TEM plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - Use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin was studied in 30 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. In 20 patients ciprofloxacin was given alone and in 10 patients (including 8 compromised hosts) in combination with an aminoglycoside (9) or azlocillin (1). Ciprofloxacin was given in doses of 500 mg orally or 200-300 mg i.v. every 12 h. In patients receiving only ciprofloxacin clinical cure with eradication of bacteria was obtained in 15 patients (75%) with infections of bone and joint (6), skin and soft tissue (4), lung (2), middle ear (2) and CSF (1). Two patients with lymphoma and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia died. In patients receiving combination therapy a definite therapeutic success was achieved in four (40%). Three patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia died. In seven patients nine bacterial strains with decreasing susceptibility of ciprofloxacin (increase in MIC from less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml to 2-16 micrograms/ml) were selected (6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1 Staphylococcus aureus). Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated. This new quinolone seems to be suitable for single drug treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with normal host defense mechanisms, while its therapeutic potential in compromised hosts requires further evaluation.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Emergence of resistance after therapy with antibiotics used alone or combined in  a murine model.
AB  - A murine model of peritonitis allowing detection and quantification of in-vivo acquired resistance during short term therapy has been used in order to evaluate the capacity of antimicrobial combinations to limit emergence of resistance, as compared to individual components of the regimens. Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 10(8) cfu of bacteria. Two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was injected subcutaneously: amikacin (15 mg/kg), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), pefloxacin (25 mg/kg), amikacin + ceftriaxone, amikacin + pefloxacin or ceftriaxone + pefloxacin. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus never became resistant. Single drug therapy yielded resistant mutants in Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as follows: 74% of ceftriaxone-treated animals, 57% of pefloxacin treated animals and 27% of amikacin treated animals. All the tested combinations reduced the frequency of in-vivo acquired resistance produced by single drugs, and no combination selected resistance when the separate agents of the combination did not. Combining antimicrobial agents limits the risk of emergence of resistance during antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships amongst beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - Using a variety of beta-lactamases including those from Escherichia coli (TEM-1), Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Staphylococcus aureus the inhibition profiles (I50 values) were determined for various groups of compounds including penicillins, penicillanic acid derivatives (sulphone and beta-halo substitutions), olivanic acids and clavulanic acid derivatives including substituted ethers and amines. Some of the latter compounds had higher activity than clavulanic acid with and without preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor but they still had poor activity against the P99 enzyme. Improvements in activity against Class I cephalosporinases were obtained with some derivatives of clavulanic acid but this was usually achieved at the expense of activity against clavulanate susceptible beta-lactamases. The olivanic acids had the highest activity against the widest range of beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro studies of the synergism of piperacillin and netilmicin against blood culture isolates.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro synergism between piperacillin and netilmicin against microorganisms isolated from Danish patients with septicemia and to examine the influence of inactivation of piperacillin among these bacteria on the synergy results. A total of 132 stains was examined: Escherichia coli 20, indole-positive Proteus 17, Klebsiella pneumoniae 18, Enterobacter cloacae 20, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20, Staphylococcus aureus 20, and coagulase-negative staphylococci 17. Synergy testing was performed by checkerboard titration in microtiter trays. The ability of the strains to inactivate piperacillin was examined by the clover-leaf test. Synergism was found for 52% of the strains and partial synergism for 32%. Antagonism was not found. Of the piperacillin-resistant strains synergism could be demonstrated in 80% compared with 33% of the piperacillin-susceptible strains (p less than 0.001). No significant correlation was seen between the results of the synergy test and the results of the susceptibility test to netilmicin. The frequency of piperacillin inactivation according to the clover-leaf test was significantly higher among the strains with synergism than among all the others (p less than 0.02). The combination of piperacillin and netilmicin gave good results concerning the in vitro synergism. This synergism was probably sometimes caused by netilmicin disturbing the bacterial production of piperacillin-inactivating proteins.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - In vitro activities of the quinolone antimicrobial agents A-56619 and A-56620.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new quinolone antimicrobial agents, A-56619 and A-56620, were compared with those of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents. The activity of A-56620 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Aeromonas hydrophila (MICs for 90% of the strains were less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml); Acinetobacter anitratus and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the strains was 0.5 micrograms/ml); and most streptococci. Against other gram-negative strains, A-56620 demonstrated activity comparable to that of norfloxacin, but the new drug was two to eight times more active than norfloxacin against gram-positive isolates. A-56620 was more active than A-56619 against most gram-negative organisms tested. Of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae examined, 88% were inhibited by A-56619 and 99% by A-56620 at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. By time-kill methods, the new quinolones were bactericidal against gram-negative bacilli during the first 6 h of incubation, but against S. aureus and enterococci the drugs were primarily bacteriostatic during this period. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to 10 micrograms of these drugs per ml was less than 10(-8) for all species tested except E. cloacae, but by serial passage through incremental concentrations of the antimicrobial agents, colonies many-fold more resistant than the initial isolate could be selected. However, resistance to concentrations of the drug greater than 100 micrograms/ml remained stable after passage on antibiotic-free media in only 1 of 35 strains tested.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
AB  - Solutions of Clinifeed ISO, Triosorbon, Vivonex Standard (full- and half-strength) and Vivonex HN were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. Samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees C and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. No increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees C. All organisms multiplied rapidly in Clinifeed ISO and in Triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees C. There was less rapid growth in half-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, although at 37 degrees C all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two S. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength Vivonex Standard at both 25 and 37 degrees C. In full-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, only P. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, K. aerogenes and E. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees C. None of the test organisms multiplied in full strength Vivonex HN at any of the temperatures studied. The results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low pH and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
TI  - Carbapenems: special properties contributing to their activity.
AB  - Imipenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits most clinical isolates of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci, excluding enterococci, at 1 microgram/ml or less. Resistance can develop in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, albeit infrequently. Pseudomonas maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to imipenem. Many strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Clostridium freundii, and S. marcescens resistant to the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins are susceptible to imipenem, but tend to have higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. In general, imipenem inhibits organisms resistant to other beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Imipenem binds to PBP-2 and rapidly kills most bacteria which it inhibits. Imipenem is highly stable against attack by beta-lactamases of both plasmid and chromosomal origin, and is more stable by several thousand-fold than earlier beta-lactamase stable compounds. It acts as a suicide inhibitor of beta-lactamases. Imipenem does induce beta-lactamases, but the activity of imipenem against isolates containing induced beta-lactamases is not decreased and it appears not to be susceptible to the trapping that occurs with some of the cephalosporins. Imipenem acts synergistically with aminoglycosides against a wide variety of bacteria, but this is most readily demonstrated for Streptococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa organisms which show a difference between inhibition and killing. Overall, the excellent activity of imipenem is the result of (1) the lack of a permeability barrier; (2) high affinity for PBP-2, a critical protein in cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bacteria, and for critical penicillin-binding proteins of gram-positive species; and, above all, (3) its great beta-lactamase stability.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime and desacetyl-cefotaxime in Staphylococcus and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Population analyses of susceptibility to cefotaxime (CTX) and desacetyl-cefotaxime (DCTX) of strains of Staphylococcus and some genera of Enterobacteriaceae were carried out. DCTX, which is the main metabolite of CTX, has antimicrobial activity. The penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to both agents. CTX was about 4-8 times more active than DCTX. The methicillin-resistant strains contained a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both CTX and DCTX. The frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-6) - 10(-5). The E. coli strain was homogeneous to both agents. The strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii had a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both agents. The frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-7) - 10(-4.5). In Klebsiella pneumoniae no resistant sub-population was found. CTX was about four times more active than DCTX with the strains of the Enterobacteriaceae. DCTX had no advantage over CTX as regards homogeneity of susceptibility of the populations examined. CTX seems applicable for treatment of infections with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and penicillinase-producing, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, but should not be used alone in treatments of infections with Enterobacter cloacae or Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - 70% alcohol disinfection of transducer heads: experimental trials.
AB  - We investigated the feasibility of transducer head disinfection with 70% alcohol  wipes. In the initial trial, nine gas-sterilized transducers were inoculated with an estimated 5 X 10(6) organisms of a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae, mimicking a contaminated fluid couple. A sterile disposable transducer dome was attached to each transducer. The units were allowed to sit for 24 hours at room temperature; the domes were then removed. Three transducer heads were cultured prior to disinfection to ensure that viable organisms remained. Each transducer head was wiped clean with a single alcohol wipe, allowed to dry, and then cultured. All nine cultures showed growth of E. cloacae. A second series of trials with 54 transducers employed an identical protocol, except that each transducer head received not one, but two, applications of alcohol. In addition to E. cloacae (26 runs), Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were employed in nine, nine and ten runs, respectively. Cultures of 53 of 54 transducer heads showed no growth; the single positive culture was attributed to an error in technique. These preliminary results suggest that the double-alcohol-wipe technique may be an easy, cost-effective, alternative or supplemental method of transducer head disinfection. However, we do not advocate routine implementation of this technique in patient care settings until clinical trials confirm its safety and efficacy.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Pathogenesis of catheter sepsis: a prospective study with quantitative and semiquantitative cultures of catheter hub and segments.
AB  - Our purpose was to study prospectively the causes, routes of infection, and frequency of catheter-related sepsis in patients on total parenteral nutrition. From January 1981 to January 1984, cultures of 135 subclavian catheters from 135 adult patients were done by quantitative and semiquantitative methods. Twenty patients (14.8%) had catheter-related sepsis. Fourteen episodes (70%) stemmed from an colonized hub. Skin infection (Staphylococcus aureus, 2 cases), total parenteral nutrition mixture contamination (Enterobacter cloacae, 2 cases), and hematogenous seeding of the catheter tip (Yersinia enterocolitica, 1 case, and Streptococcus faecalis, 1 case) accounted for the remaining six septic episodes. The catheter hub is, in our experience, the most common site of origin of organisms causing catheter tip infection and bacteremia.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Affinity of carumonam for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Direct labeling experiments with [14C]-carumonam as well as competition binding assays with [14C]-benzylpenicillin and [14C]-ceftriaxone have demonstrated that penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest affinity for carumonam (Ro 17-2301, AMA-1080). PBP 1a is inhibited only at significantly higher concentration whereas other PBPs display poor affinity. The IC50 values for binding to PBP 3 in E. coli and E. cloacae are in the range of the MIC-values (0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml), whereas those for P. aeruginosa are much lower than the MIC obtained in vitro. In accordance with the PBP affinity pattern observed for carumonam, filament formation resulted after exposure to concentrations greater than 1/2 MIC. Although PBP 1 and 2 of Staphylococcus aureus could be titrated with radioactive carumonam, very high concentrations were required and in line with the poor affinity for all four PBPs in S. aureus, this organism is resistant to carumonam.
TI  - Temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  - In a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. The patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. In addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency, and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection.
TI  - Versatile Escherichia coli-Bacillus shuttle vectors derived from runaway replication plasmids related to CloDF13.
AB  - Versatile cloning vectors were constructed employing a runaway replication mutant of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid CloDF13. These vectors can, under conditions where protein synthesis is not inhibited, be amplified in Escherichia coli to high levels by elevating the temperature and are therefore useful for the production of large quantities of DNA and protein. Since the constructed shuttle vectors, which harbour at least six unique restriction endonucleases sites, replicate in E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus and a variety of Bacilli, they are applicable for the genetic engineering of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Cefmenoxime therapy in bacterial osteomyelitis.
AB  - Cefmenoxime, a new parenteral beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporin, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in 15 patients (10 male and five female) with acute (1 patient) and chronic (14 patients) osteomyelitis. Diagnosis was made by culture of the surgical biopsy specimen. Osteomyelitis was treated with 8 to 12 g of cefmenoxime per day (mean 9.1 g) for 42 to 66 days (mean 47.3). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated organism. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefmenoxime were determined and all pathogens were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml or less, except for Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species, both of which had an MIC of 25.0 micrograms/ml. All patients had at least one surgical debridement. Of the 15 patients, 10 (67 percent) had the osteomyelitis "arrested." These patients have been followed up five to 14 months after completion of cefmenoxime therapy. Toxicity studies indicated mild elevations in serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase in two patients. Cefmenoxime appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic in the treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - An evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980RP).
AB  - Ceftiolene (42980RP) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. The affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for Escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight PBPs of E. coli. Enterobacter cloacae. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The affinity of ceftiolene for PBP1 of Staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for PBP3. The bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against Gram-negative organisms was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. Introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into E. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. Chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene- or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. Growth of Staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. These observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine MIC determinations to distinguish between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - Mechanism of action of the new orally active cephalosporin FK027.
AB  - The mechanism of action of a new orally active cephalosporin, FK027, was compared to that of cephalexin and cefaclor to elucidate its excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. FK027 showed very high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 3, 1a and 1bs of Escherichia coli whereas cephalexin showed fairly high affinity for PBPs 1a, 4 and 3. The ability of FK027 to penetrate the outer membranes of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae was less than that of cephalexin and cefaclor. However, FK027 was extremely stable to both plasmid-mediated penicillinases and chromosomal beta-lactamases except the Bacteroides fragilis enzyme and its stability was superior to that of cephalexin and cefaclor. These results indicate that the potent antibacterial activity of FK027 is based on its enhanced affinity for the target enzymes and its high stability to beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has excellent microbiologic activity against most pathogens that produce meningitis; both components of this drug have high penetration into tissues, including the cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical experience shows that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be beneficial in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis caused by organisms only moderately susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins (Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens) or resistant to these antibiotic agents (Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter). The success of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of four patients with Staphylococcus aureus and two patients with Listeria monocytogenes meningitis shows that this drug may also be useful in treating infrequent types of gram-positive meningitis.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. Netilmicin combinations were least active. On gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. No antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefoperazone (CPZ) against clinical isolates including various beta-lactamase-producing strains were studied and compared with those of cefotiam (CTM). CPZ had a broad spectrum against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Especially, CPZ showed apparently more potent antibacterial activities than CTM against Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, CPZ was less active than CTM against Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. The stability and affinity of CPZ for various types of beta-lactamase were also studied. CPZ was more resistant to hydrolysis by typical cephalosporinase (CSase) and cefuroximase (CXase) than CTM, but was less stable to penicillinase (PCase). CPZ often showed higher affinity to beta-lactamases than CTM. The study for the inducer-activity revealed that CPZ hardly induced CSase production in E. cloacae and Proteus vulgaris while CTM highly induced in both strains. CPZ was more active against CSase-producers than CTM, especially against strains which inducibly produced the enzyme. It was speculated that this activity was responsible for the superior stability to CSase and low inducer-activity for CSase production.
TI  - [In vivo effects of cefoperazone in local infection].
AB  - The in vivo antibacterial activity and the penetration into inflammatory tissues  of cefoperazone (CPZ) were compared with those of cefotiam (CTM) in local infection systems using mouse subcutaneous abscess and rat granuloma pouch. The serum levels of CPZ in subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus F-230 (penicillinase producing strain) were lower than that of CTM, but there was no significance between the therapeutic effects of both drugs. The same results were obtained using Staphylococcus aureus F-196 (penicillinase non-producing strain). When infected with Enterobacter cloacae H-27 (cephalosporinase producing strain) in rat granuloma pouch, the exudate levels of CTM were lower than those of CPZ. Judging from these results, it was suggested that CPZ was a useful antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial-inflammatory tissues.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  - Hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. The search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. In this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. In each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained. All organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. In the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. After the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. This therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. In our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. In most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. All but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by Enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
TI  - Comparative study of fosfomycin activity in Mueller-Hinton media and in tissues.
AB  - Fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  L-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. The latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus was studied in Mueller-Hinton broth. An almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. Fosfomycin activity against Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fosfomycin against Staph. aureus Streptococcus faecalis, E. coli, Ent. cloacae, Pr. mirabilis, and Ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in Mueller-Hinton broth. With few exceptions the MICs in Mueller-Hinton broth (with glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It inhibited Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. It did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or Listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia spp., and Serratia spp. Cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. Cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. Cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Ceftazidime therapy of serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftazidime, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, was administered to 30 patients  with serious bacterial infections in a randomized dosing trial with daily doses of 1.5 or 3 g. Both regimens were equally efficacious, with satisfactory clinical responses in 28 instances (93%) and microbiological eradication of 79% of initial bacterial isolates. The development of resistance to ceftazidime during therapy was observed in three cases (Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and superinfection by a resistant Enterobacter agglomerans strain occurred in one case. Adverse reactions of clinical significance included one case each of leukopenia, azotemia, diarrhea (Clostridium difficile toxin positive), and rash.
TI  - Cefotetan: antimicrobial activity in-vitro compared with that of cefotaxime.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotetan and cefotaxime were compared in vitro against 547 strains of aerobes and 24 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates from 20 hospitals. Cefotetan was found to exhibit an activity two- to fourfold lower than that of cefotaxime against most of the enterobacteriaceae. About half the number of Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to cefotetan were resistant also to cefotaxime. Cefotetan was more active than cefotaxime against most of the strains of Proteus vulgaris. In contrast to cefotaxime which was moderately active, cefotetan was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotetan had limited activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was resistant to both cefotetan and cefotaxime. Bact. fragilis was inhibited more effectively by cefotetan than by cefotaxime. Depending on the species tested, the activity of cefotetan was influenced significantly by the inoculum size in some cases. Different test media did not affect the results.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - Broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  - In 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, Silastic Broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. The catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. There were 14 episodes of Broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. Cultures of blood drawn from Broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. The most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. The species causing the infections were Enterobacter cloacae (three cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), Staphylococcus aureus (three cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), Escherichia coli (two cases), Pseudomonas dentrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis. Antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro studies and clinical evaluation.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against 437 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli was determined. Ceftriaxone was found to have high in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of Enterobacter cloacae. Ceftriaxone was only minimally active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and toxicity of ceftriaxone in 55 adult patients. Bacterial infection was confirmed by the isolation of etiological bacteria in 30 patients. Infectious disorders treated included 10 pneumonias, 13 urinary tract infections, and 7 soft tissue or bone infections. Pathogens identified were 25 isolates of gram-negative bacilli, 5 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 5 isolates of pneumococci, and 4 isolates of other streptococci. The overall efficacy of ceftriaxone was excellent. The clinical cure rate was 93%, and the bacteriological cure rate was 93%. A total of 30 adverse reactions were noted in 22 of 55 patients receiving ceftriaxone, but only one necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Adverse effects frequently noted were elevated hepatic enzymes (16%), thrombocytosis (16%), and eosinophilia (8%). Ceftriaxone is an effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent that appears promising for the treatment of serious gram-negative bacillary infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Obturator foramen grafts: the preferable alternate route?
AB  - Although the femoral canal is the standard entrance route for vascular grafts to  the lower extremity, several situations may arise that preclude the use of this route. In these circumstances an alternate pathway for revascularization is required. Experience in our center with the use of obturator foramen grafts for revascularization of nine limbs in eight patients is reported and underscores the value of this pathway as an alternative route for limb revascularization. The obturator foramen was employed to circumvent an infected arterial prosthesis at the groin level in seven patients (eight limbs) from 12 days to 4.5 years after the initial vascular procedure. The organisms responsible for graft infection included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The final patient required iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass via the obturator foramen to manage occlusion and autolysis of the femoral artery by a mycotic embolus containing beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Graft material used for these remedial procedures, included saphenous vein (three), Gore-Tex (three), and Dacron (three). Revascularization was satisfactory in each case. Each groin infection healed. Two patients died of unrelated causes at 1.5 and 5 months after operation. The seven remaining grafts at risk (six patients) remained patent 12 months in each case. Four grafts were doing well at 18, 36, 50, and 52 months. Three grafts failed at 13, 19, and 28 months; one was revised successfully, one was re-done and failed again. Obturator foramen bypass grafting provides satisfactory and durable revascularization when an alternate route to the lower extremity is required.
TI  - Simple screening method for gram-positive bacterial beta-lactam antibiotic tolerance on routine laboratory Bauer-Kirby antibiogram plates.
AB  - A simple screening method served to detect beta-lactam antibiotic-tolerant variants of clinical isolates and laboratory control strains of staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Listeria monocytogenes. The beta-lactamase(s) of a multiple drug-resistant strain of Enterobacter cloacae (isolate No. 19) yielded most consistent results as compared with several other beta-lactamase producers; the E. cloacae beta-lactamase(s) was neutralized by clavulanic acid. Spot inocula of E. cloacae isolate No. 19, following overnight "induction" with 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin and 3 microgram/ml of cephalothin in tryptic soya broth, were applied centrally to beta-lactam antibiotic inhibition zones of Bauer-Kirby antibiogram plates (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA, and diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA) following removal of the appropriate disks. The spot-inoculated plates were incubated overnight at 35 degrees C and inspected for satellite growths of tolerant variants around the E. cloacae spot inocula. Satellite growths of less than or equal to 10 colonies were interpreted to indicate tolerance of the relevant cell wall synthesis inhibitor. The method readily permitted detection of variants tolerant for ampicillin, cephalothin, penicillin G, piperacillin, azlocillin, and mezlocillin. However, strains documented by minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations to be tolerant for cefotaxime, cefoxitin, fosfomycin, and vancomycin only rarely gave rise to respective satellite growths. DSTA proved superior to MHA with respect to "rescue" of inhibited tolerant staphylococcal variants; furthermore, the diameters of inhibition zones obtained on DSTA correlated well with those on MHA. Therefore, DSTA was adopted as the routine test medium for clinical staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - In vitro comparison of cefotetan with five other cephalosporins against nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan against Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacterial strains including nonfermenting species has been compared with that of cefoxitin, cefotaxim, moxalactam, cefoperazone and ceftazidime by use of an agar dilution method. Cefotetan was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species and only moderately active against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Enterobacter cloacae. It was more active than cefoxitin and cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and indole-positive Proteus strains.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The in-vivo antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (Gr 20263)--a comparison with other new beta-lactam antibiotics and gentamicin.
AB  - Ceftazidime was compared with cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefoperazone, moxalactam, piperacillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, cefsulodin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin in a series of mouse protection tests. Ceftazidime, together with the other cephalosporin antibiotics and moxalactam were equally effective against infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus with ED50 values ranging from 3.5 to 25 mg/kg. Gentamicin was the most active antibiotic with ED50 values of 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. Ceftazidime showed excellent activity against Enterobacteriaceae with ED50 values ranging from 0.2-0.9 mg/kg for Escherichia coli strains, 1.1-13.8 mg/kg for indole positive and negative Proteus spp, and 0.1-25 for Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia spp. Similar activity against many of the test strains of Enterobacteriaceae was found for gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime and moxalactam, although cefotiam and cefoperazone were significantly less active than ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was significantly more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with ED50 values ranging from 02-108 mg/kg. Only the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, with ED(50,S) 0.6-6.3 mg/kg, was as effective as ceftazidime. Very poor activity was found for moxalactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin, carbenicillin and mezlocillin against the majority of the test strains of Pseudomonas. The results of these in-vivo indicate that ceftazidime is a promising potential alternative to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability and antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a  novel cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefmenoxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has been shown to be stable to a Staphylococcus aureus penicillinase and R plasmid-mediated type I and type IV penicillinases. It was also resistant to hydrolysis by most cephalosporinases, but was susceptible to hydrolysis by a Proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. Cefmenoxime was active against cephaloridine-resistant species, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was moderately resistant to cefmenoxime. Cefmenoxime was an inducer of P. vulgaris beta-lactamase biosynthesis, but 1 microgram or more of the drug per ml, which inhibits most of the clinical isolates of P. vulgaris, was required for the production of detectable amounts of the enzyme. Cefmenoxime was a strong competitive inhibitor of beta-lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, P. aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, but it did not inhibit penicillinases in spite of its resistance to hydrolysis.
TI  - Pathological study of infective endocarditis on Hancock porcine bioprostheses.
AB  - A pathological study has been performed on 10 infected Hancock bioprostheses removed from nine patients who died of prosthetic endocarditis. The devices had been in place from 2 to 87 months (average 37.5), the interval between operation and onset of infection averaging 30 months. The offending organisms were Gram negative bacteria in three patients (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens), Gram positive bacteria in two (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans), and fungi in four (Candida species in three and Aspergillus species in one). Gross examination of the explants revealed in most cases a vegetative endocarditis of one porcine valve leaflets. Septic embolization occurred in five cases owing to the high friability of the vegetations. Prosthetic valve incompetence was the commonest type to dysfunction observed because of tears, perforations, and even complete destruction of the cusps. Prosthetic valve stenosis following obstruction of the valve orifice by infected polypous masses was noted in two cases. Clumps of infective organisms were detected deep in the cusp tissue in most cases on histologic examination. Infection located on the paraprosthetic tissues, associated with ring abscess, valve detachment, and insufficiency, was observed only once. According to the results of investigation, endocarditis on porcine bioprostheses is associated with a better preserved native valvular ring as viewed at reoperation. Therefore surgical intervention appears appropriate in the presence of severe hemodynamic complications after adequate antibiotic treatment. However, infection of these particular prostheses still carries an extremely high mortality. In the present series, this poor outcome might be explained by the frequently associated septic and thromboembolic events.
TI  - Effect of combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam.
AB  - The effect of cefsulodin in combination with mecillinam was examined against a wide range of bacterial species. The antibacterial spectrum was widened by the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam in the ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. In overall observations, in the in vitro test, a synergistic effect against clinical isolates was found on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, and an additive effect was found on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In in vivo tests, a synergistic effect was observed on S. marcescens TN 66 and K. pneumoniae DT infections and an additive effect was observed on S. aureus 308 A-1, E. coli O-111 and T-7, C. freundii TN 518, E. cloacae TN 603, P. vulgaris GN 4712, P. morganii Tn 373 and P. aeruginosa U 31 infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefotaxime, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This cephalosporin was slightly less active than cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus but 4 to 300 times as active as carbenicillin against gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Cefotaxime was the most active compound against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 20- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin against the indole-positive Proteus group. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of the compound were identical to, or two times higher than, the minimal inhibitory concentrations against Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and four times higher against S. marcescens. A reduction of inoculum size decreased greatly the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cefotaxime against E. coli P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens. The antibiotic was very stable to penicillinase and cephalosporinase produced by gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus vulgaris.
TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - [Fosfomycin, a new antibiotic: in vitro activity compared with mezlocillin, cefuroxime and gentamicin].
AB  - In vitro investigations with fosfomycin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin  against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae an pseudomonadaceae were carried out by Agar Dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar. The fosfomycin breakpoint for the low dosage of 2-3 times 3 g per infusion daily was defined with 16 micro g/ml and for the high dosage of 2-3 times 5 g fosfomycin per infusion with 64 micro g/ml. At a concentration of 16 micro g/l fosfomycin more than 90% of the cultures of staph. aureus (penicillin-resistant), e. coli, proteus mirabilis an proteus vulgaris examined were inhibited. At a concentration of less than 64 micro g/ml fosfomycin 80 toi 100% of the cultures of serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morgani et rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gentamicin sensitive and resistant) were inhibited. Fosfomycin showed an absolute stability against many Beta-Lactamases of different bacterial species.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigations with a new Semisynthetic oxy-beta-lactam antibiotic LY 127935 (AUTHOR'S TRANSL)].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a new oxy-beta-lactam antibiotic LY 127935 against  1066 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial was evaluated in comparison to cephalothin. The antibiotic has a very wide spectrum and is exceptionally active, in particular against gram-negative rods. It is also active against multiresistant problem strains found in intensive care units (Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, indole-positive Proteus), and proved to be quite effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although LY 127935 is effective against Staphylococcus aureus, cephalothin is superior. Its use is not indicated against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (BL-S 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. One Gram-positive strain and six Gram-negative strains were used. Bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. Tests showed that against Klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. Proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; Enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; Escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. The number of viable cells of Staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. On the other hand, Providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.
TI  - PS-5, a new beta-lactam antibiotic. II. Antimicrobial activity.
AB  - PS-5, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, has relatively potent antimicrobial activity  against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially the Enterobacter groups, Serratia marcescens, the Proteus groups and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The activity of PS-5 against many beta-lactamase-producing organisms is greater than that of cefoxitin or cefazolin. PS-5 has good therapeutic activity in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus Smith or Enterobacter cloacae 45.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to Gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia also had a urinary tract infection. Two patients had a respiratory tract infection, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient, and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 hr after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Substrate inhibition of beta-lactamases, a method for predicting enzymatic stability of cephalosporins.
AB  - Selected cephalosporins, including cefamandole, cephaloridine, cephaloglycin, and cefoxitin, were examined for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of and act as substrates for beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. Enzyme inhibition was determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetic measurements and by a spot plate assay using a chromogenic substrate (Glaxo compound 87/312). These two methods provide comparable estimates of kinetic parameters. Inhibition of beta-lactamase, as measured by these two methods, was generally found to correlate with resistance to hydrolysis and is proposed as a preliminary method of assessing susceptibility of cephalosporins to beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Four 7-alphaOCH(3), 7-alphaH cephalosporin analogue pairs were also examined. The presence of the 7-alphaOCH(3) substituent invariably resulted in reduced susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, regardless of the other C7 substituent. The 7-alphaOCH(3) compounds were also better inhibitors than were their 7-alphaH analogues, with the exception that 7-alphaOCH(3) compounds having C7 adipic acid substituents were less inhibitory to the S. aureus enzyme than were the corresponding 7-alphaH analogues. Response of these two enzymes to 7-alphaOCH(3) and 7-alphaH cephalosporins suggests that beta-lactamase hydrolysis of these compounds involves attack at the alpha side of the betalactam ring.
TI  - Interference by Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by other bacterial species.
AB  - Growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from clinical specimens has been enhanced by the  use of selective media that inhibit the simultaneous growth of other microorganisms. One explanation for this enhancement could be that certain other bacteria inhibit gonococcal growth. This hypothesis was examined by testing 167 bacterial isolates for in vitro gonococcal inhibition; 34.1% of the isolates failed to inhibit the gonococcus, but 12.0% produced weak inhibition and 53.9% strongly inhibited N. gonorrhoeae. The pattern of in vitro gonococcal inhibition was consistently the same for all the individual isolates within some species, but individual isolates within other bacterial species varied in their ability to inhibit the gonococcus. Consistently strong in vitro N. gonorrhoeae inhibitors were Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas. The in vivo significance of gonococcal interference was demonstrated in the subcutaneous chamber model of N. gonorrhoeae infection.
TI  - Laboratory studies with cefatrizine (SK + F 60771), a new broad-spectrum orally-active cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefatrizine (SK&F 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. The average MIC values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. In addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. Cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. It had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Hemophilus influenzae, Proteus morganii or Staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. A variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with gram-negative bacteremias also had urinary tract infections. Two patients had respiratory tract infections, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 h after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 mug/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Effect of catecholamines on the bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dihydroxyphenylalanine at 8 mm concentrations prevented iodination of zymosan by intact neutrophils and decarboxylation of l-alanine by leukocyte sonic extracts. The same concentration of epinephrine also reduced bactericidal activity of the leukocyte against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus rettgeri without decreasing phagocytosis of bacteria. Spectral studies indicated that epinephrine interferes with the myeloperoxidase-mediated reactions by competing for available H(2)O(2) via its enzymatic oxidation to adrenochrome. These findings support a mechanism in which H(2)O(2) plays an important role in the bactericidal activity of the leukocyte.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
