TI  == the effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  == we have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and prevotella melaninogenica. in the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four fusobacteria species (fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, f. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. we also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm  with power density of 80 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 j/cm2. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light  at 455 nm with power density of 50 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 j/cm2. microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mw/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 j/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. the selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard dna-dna format. in cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). hplc demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in  bacteria. following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). dna probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. the cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. this may introduce a new avenue of  prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. methods: microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. microbiological identification was performed using checker-board dna-dna hybridization for 40 different bacteria. data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. results: detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). the most frequent bacteria were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia. facultative species were identified in 20 root canals  (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). the number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. conclusion: endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis  and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == the identification of genes specific to prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, which are often isolated from periodontal sites, were once considered two different genotypes of p. intermedia. although the genomic sequence of p. intermedia was determined recently, little is known about the genetic differences between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the  subtractive hybridization technique is a powerful method for generating a set of  dna fragments differing between two closely related bacterial strains or species. we used subtractive hybridization to identify the dna regions specific to p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 25261. using this method, four p. intermedia atcc 25611-specific and three p. nigrescens atcc 25261-specific regions were determined. from the species-specific regions, insertion sequence (is) elements were isolated for p. intermedia. is elements play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria. for the p. intermedia-specific regions, the genes adenine-specific dna-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase  were isolated. the p. nigrescens-specific region contained a flavobacterium psychrophilum spra homologue, a cell-surface protein involved in gliding motility, prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 glutathione peroxide, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 leucyl-trna synthetase. the results demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization technique was useful for distinguishing between the two closely related species. furthermore, this technique will contribute to our understanding of the virulence of these species.

TI  == the relationship of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and prevotella melaninogenica in the supragingival plaque of children, caries and oral malodor.
AB  == purpose: a relationship between the distribution of periodontal bacteria species  and malodor in children has not been sufficiently investigated. the present study was undertaken to determine the presence of 3 periodontopathic bacteria (prevotella spp. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in the supragingival plaques of 3 to 16-year-old children with different oral health conditions and oral malodor. methods: the number of decayed and filled primary teeth (df) and decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (dmf), papillary marginal and attached gingivitis (pma) index, oral hygiene index (ohi), and oral  malodor of each subject were determined prior to the collection of supragingival  plaques. three periodontopathic bacteria (p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. melaninogenica) in supragingival plaques were detected by using an immunoslot blot assay with monoclonal antibodies specific for each microorganism. findings:  the frequencies of periodontopathic bacteria in children with and without caries  were not significantly different from each other. positivity for p. intermedia, but not for p. nigrescens or p. melaninogenica was correlated with oral malodor.  oral malodor was also correlated with the debris index, a component of ohi. the group with the higher ohi showed a higher prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria. for the 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the subjects tested, plaques positive for any of them were not age related. however the frequencies of all 3 periodontopathic bacteria were the highest in the 3-6-year olds. conclusion: the  supragingival plaques in children can harbor 3 species of periodontopathic bacteria, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. melaninogenica.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == proteinase activity of prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus  are also known to be associated with such infection. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. a total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. prevotella loescheii, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae, and prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) a-units) lower than that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) a-units). in the case of p. loescheii, p. melaninogenica, and p. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. proteolytic activity for all species of prevotella examined was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. this study suggests that prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == frequency of reactivity for porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. in supra- and subgingival plaques, and periodontal clinical parameters according to  subject age.
AB  == background: the present study was conducted to assess the association between selected clinical parameters and the distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and prevotella melaninogenica (pm) in supra- and subgingival plaque samples measured by an immunoslot blot assay (iba) using their monoclonal antibodies. methods: plaque samples from 299 patients aged 6 to 69 randomly chosen from a group of dental outpatients were examined. plaque index, gingival index, and probing depths were  evaluated according to the criteria of positive (cell number > or = 10(6)) or negative (<106) reactivity to the 4 different monoclonal antibodies. results: an  increase in probing depth in subjects exhibiting either a positive or negative reaction for the 4 test bacteria was associated with increasing age. comparing bacteria-positive subgingival plaque samples to their corresponding bacteria-negative counterparts, we found an increased plaque index in children positive for any of the 4 bacteria; in addition, that for pg and pi was increased in subjects 40 to 49 years old. the gingival index increased with increasing amount of pi and pn, but not with pg and pm in those 20 to 29 years of age. the frequency of pg reactivity in subgingival plaque was markedly enhanced in subjects older than 30 to 39 years of age, and was significantly higher than that in supragingival plaque. the frequency of pi and pn reactivity was significantly  increased in adults aged 20 to 29 and plateaued at older ages. the frequency of pm reactivity was relatively low and independent of subject age. conclusions: the increase in probing depth with increasing age was not affected by the occurrence  of periodontopathic bacteria. the high rate of occurrence of pg, together with pi and pn, in subgingival plaque of the adult age groups was suggested to be associated with the high frequency of periodontal disease in the older age groups (above 30 to 49 years of age). the iba appears to be useful for the efficient and rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == genetic relationships within the genus prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the genetic diversity and relationships within the genus prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and dna-dna hybridization. mlee revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ets) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. the index of association described by maynard smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus prevotella. a dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ets showed that species like p. bivia, p. buccae, p. oris, p. oralis, p. nigrescens, and p. denticola form clusters that are consistent with dna homologies. however, strains identified as p. melaninogenica or p. loescheii by dna-dna hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in mlee. mlee analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. it provides an alternative to 16s rrna analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high dna homology or high rrna homology.

TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

AB  == black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) have been associated with endodontic infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate further the presence of bpb with the clinical signs and symptoms associated with endodontic infections. microbial samples were collected from the root canals of 40 intact teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis. conventional laboratory methods were used for identification of the strains of bpb isolated in pure culture. in addition, the polymerase chain reaction and specific primers for 16s r-rna genes were used to differentiate prevotella nigrescens from prevotella intermedia. twenty-two (55%)  samples were positive for the growth of bpb. of those, 11 of 22 (50%) were identified as p. nigrescens, 8 of 22 (36%) were p. intermedia, 2 of 22 (9%) were  porphyromonas gingivalis, and 1 of 22 (5%) was prevotella melaninogenica. sixteen of the 22 root canals positive for the growth of bpb were associated with purulent drainage either from the root canal or an associated sinus tract. statistical analysis did not show a significant relationship for the presence of  bpb with clinical signs and symptoms.

TI  == beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species isolated from young children.
AB  == the frequency of beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species isolated from 23 healthy young children and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 186 available beta-lactamase-positive isolates were examined by using  the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the etest (ab biodisk) and/or the agar dilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (villanova, pa, usa), respectively. beta-lactamase-positive prevotella melaninogenica strains were isolated from all  children, and more than two-thirds of the prevotella denticola and prevotella loescheii strains isolated from the children were beta-lactamase-positive. the beta-lactamase-producing prevotella intermedia group consisted of prevotella nigrescens and the p. intermedia/ p. nigrescens-like organism (pinlo); p. intermedia was not found. only two p. nigrescens isolates but most of the pinlo isolates produced beta-lactamase. the mics for beta-lactamase-producing strains varied between 0.38 and 64 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented prevotella species colonizing young children is already frequent. the phenomenon should be taken into account in the treatment of pediatric anaerobic infections of oral origin.

AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  == the production of hsp by periodontopathic gram-negative bacteria was examined by  sds-page, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against hsps. strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, and treponema socranskii species produced hsp which reacted with anti-yersinia enterocolitica hsp 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kda hsp monoclonal antibodies. it found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human hsp were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. the present study suggests that hsps are implicated in human periodontal disease  process.

TI  == the tet(q) gene in bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontal disease.
AB  == twenty-two tetracycline-resistant (tetr) anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal pockets of 12 patients with refractory periodontitis were examined for the presence of the tet q determinant by dna-dna  hybridization. dot blots of bacterial dna were tested with an intragenic digoxigenin-labelled tet(q) probe consisting of a 1.45 kb ecori/pvuii fragment from plasmid pnfd13-2. southern blots of chromosomal dna digested with the restriction enzyme ecori were also examined. the tet(q) probe hybridized with dna from 8 of the 22 tetr strains, including 2 prevotella intermedia strains and one  strain each of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis  and prevotella melaninogenica. the tetr strains of mitsuokella dentalis and capnocytophaga ochracea also hybridized with the probe. the lack of discernible plasmid dna in all the probe-positive isolates suggests that these tetracycline-resistance genes were chromosomally encoded. the probe hybridized with a different size fragment in all the isolates. this study extends the number of species that carry the tet(q) gene to include several outside the genera prevotella and bacteroides.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
