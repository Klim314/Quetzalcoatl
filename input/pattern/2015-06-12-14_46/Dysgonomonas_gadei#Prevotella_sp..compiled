TI  - Dysgonomonas gen. nov. to accommodate Dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov., an organism isolated from a human gall bladder, and Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides (formerly CDC group DF-3).
AB  - Results of a polyphasic taxonomic study on an unknown Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillus-shaped organism isolated from an infected human gall bladder are presented. Phenotypic and molecular taxonomic studies revealed the organism to be close to, but distinct from, organisms designated CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) group DF-3. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from reference strains of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and related taxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, biochemical tests, analysis of cellular long-chain fatty acids and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in a new genus, Dysgonomonas, as Dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov. (type strain CCUG 42882T = CIP 106420T). In addition, a new species, Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate strains previously belonging to CDC group DF-3. The type species of the genus Dysgonomonas is Dysgonomonas gadei.
