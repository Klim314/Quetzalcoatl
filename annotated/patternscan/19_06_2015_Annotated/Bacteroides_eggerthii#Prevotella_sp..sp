TI  == high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == this prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. one to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the prevotella genus (bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). pcr assays were used to detect cfxa and cepa/cbla, the genes encoding class a/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the bacteroides fragilis group. the present investigation confirmed  the role of prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. additionally, this pcr screening showed (1): the high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepa/cbla (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxa in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.
