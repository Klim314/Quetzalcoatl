TI  == identification of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in mysore, india.
AB  == a healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. this study  examined the characteristics of cultivable lactobacillus species between healthy  women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). between november 2011 and sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in mysore, india were diagnosed for bv in a cross-sectional study. bv was diagnosed using amsel's criteria: homogeneous  vaginal discharge, vaginal ph > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have bv. vaginal swabs were then cultured in rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe broth.  gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 srna were further  characterized by sequencing. cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. according to amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had bv. eleven different lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. the common lactobacilli species found in this sample included l. crispatus (39.6%), l. gasseri (45.8%), and l. jensenii (14.6%). lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with bv. l. gasseri was cultured from 18.8%  of healthy and 6.1% of women with bv. the presence of l. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). these  results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. our findings showed lactobacilli species  present in healthy vagina of women in india do not differ from those reported from other countries.

TI  == metabolic signatures of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by shifts in the vaginal microbiota from lactobacillus dominant to a microbiota with diverse anaerobic bacteria. few  studies have linked specific metabolites with bacteria found in the human vagina. here, we report dramatic differences in metabolite compositions and concentrations associated with bv using a global metabolomics approach. we further validated important metabolites using samples from a second cohort of women and a different platform to measure metabolites. in the primary study, we compared metabolite profiles in cervicovaginal lavage fluid from 40 women with bv and 20 women without bv. vaginal bacterial representation was determined using broad-range pcr with pyrosequencing and concentrations of bacteria by quantitative pcr. we detected 279 named biochemicals; levels of 62% of metabolites were significantly different in women with bv. unsupervised clustering of metabolites separated women with and without bv. women with bv have metabolite profiles marked by lower concentrations of amino acids and dipeptides, concomitant with higher levels of amino acid catabolites and polyamines. higher levels of the signaling eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-hete), a biomarker for inflammation, were noted in bv. lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii exhibited similar metabolite correlation patterns, which were distinct from correlation patterns exhibited by bv-associated bacteria. several metabolites were significantly associated with clinical signs and symptoms (amsel criteria) used to diagnose bv, and no metabolite was associated with all four clinical criteria. bv has strong metabolic signatures across multiple metabolic pathways, and these signatures are associated with the presence and concentrations of particular bacteria. importance: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common but highly enigmatic condition that is associated with adverse outcomes for women and their neonates. small molecule metabolites in the  vagina may influence host physiology, affect microbial community composition, and impact risk of adverse health outcomes, but few studies have comprehensively studied the metabolomics profile of bv. here, we used mass spectrometry to link specific metabolites with particular bacteria detected in the human vagina by pcr. bv was associated with strong metabolic signatures across multiple pathways  affecting amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, highlighting the profound metabolic changes in bv. these signatures were associated with the presence and concentrations of particular vaginal bacteria, including some bacteria yet to be cultivated, thereby providing clues as to the microbial origin of many metabolites. insights from this study provide opportunities for developing new diagnostic markers of bv and novel approaches for treatment or prevention of bv.

TI  == comparison of detection methods for vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == vaginal lactobacilli offer protection against microbiota imbalance and genitourinary tract infections. we compared vaginal lactobacilli in 50 estonian women of child-bearing age applying culture-based methods, quantitative pcr and next-generation sequencing (ngs). the culture-based methods found three different lactobacilli: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus gasseri. using ngs revealed the presence of l. crispatus in 76%, lactobacillus iners in 52%, l. jensenii in 47% and l. gasseri in 33% of the samples. according  to qpcr, l. iners was present in 67% and l. crispatus in 64% of the samples. the  proportions of l. crispatus revealed by qpcr and ngs were in good correlation (r=0.79, p<0.001), while that of l. iners correlated poorly (r=0.13, pnot greater-than0.05). good concordance for l. crispatus was also found between the results of the culture-based method and qpcr. finally, good overlap between the results of the culture-based method and ngs was revealed: in case of a positive ngs result for l. crispatus, the same species was isolated in 95% of samples. the corresponding percentages were 82% for l. jensenii and 86% for l. gasseri. our data indicate fairly general concordance of the three methods for detecting vaginal lactobacilli, except for l. iners. this points out the importance of standardisation of techniques, and the respective studies should involve cultures applying a medium suitable for the fastidious l. iners.

TI  == lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health.
AB  == the human body is colonized by a vast number of microorganisms collectively referred to as the human microbiota. one of the main microbiota body sites is the female genital tract, commonly dominated by lactobacillus spp., in approximately  70% of women. each individual species can constitute approximately 99% of the ribotypes observed in any individual woman. the most frequently isolated species  are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus iners. residing at the port of entry of bacterial and viral pathogens, the vaginal lactobacillus species can create a barrier against pathogen invasion since mainly products of their metabolism secreted in the cervicovaginal fluid can play an important role in the inhibition of bacterial and viral infections. therefore, a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota appears to  be a good biomarker for a healthy vaginal ecosystem. this balance can be rapidly  altered during processes such as menstruation, sexual activity, pregnancy and various infections. an abnormal vaginal microbiota is characterized by an increased diversity of microbial species, leading to a condition known as bacterial vaginosis. information on the vaginal microbiota can be gathered from the analysis of cervicovaginal fluid, by using the nugent scoring or the amsel's  criteria, or at the molecular level by investigating the number and type of lactobacillus species. however, when translating this to the clinical setting, it should be noted that the absence of a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota does not appear to directly imply a diseased condition or dysbiosis. nevertheless, the widely documented beneficial role of vaginal lactobacillus species demonstrates the potential of data on the composition and activity of lactobacilli as biomarkers for vaginal health. the substantiation and further validation of such  biomarkers will allow the design of better targeted probiotic strategies.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using maldi-tof ms analysis and 16s rdna sequencing.
AB  == background: lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof  ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna  analysis. results: both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral lactobacillus isolates. the concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. in the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei. overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. for several samples, maldi-tof ms  analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result. conclusion: maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant  lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacilli inactivate chlamydia trachomatis through lactic acid but not h2o2.
AB  == lactobacillus species dominate the microbiome in the lower genital tract of most  reproductive-age women. producing lactic acid and h2o2, lactobacilli are believed to play an important role in prevention of colonization by and growth of pathogens. however, to date, there have been no reported studies characterizing how lactobacilli interact with chlamydia trachomatis, a leading sexually transmitted bacterium. in this report, we demonstrate inactivation of c. trachomatis infectivity by culture media conditioned by lactobacillus crispatus,  l. gasseri and l. jensenii, known to be dominating organisms in the human vaginal microbiome. lactobacillus still cultures produced lactic acid, leading to time- and concentration-dependent killing of c. trachomatis. neutralization of the acidic media completely reversed chlamydia killing. addition of lactic acid into  lactobacillus-unconditioned growth medium recapitulated the chlamydiacidal activity of conditioned media. the h2o2 concentrations in the still cultures were found to be comparable to those reported for the cervicovaginal fluid, but insufficient to inactivate chlamydiae. aeration of lactobacillus cultures by shaking markedly induced h2o2 production, but strongly inhibited lactobacillus growth and lactic acid production, and thus severely affected acidification, leading to significantly reduced chlamydiacidal efficiency. these observations indicate lactobacilli inactivate chlamydiae primarily through maintaining acidity in a relatively hypoxic environment in the vaginal lumen with limited h2o2, which is consistent with the notion that women with higher vaginal ph are more prone to sexually transmitted c. trachomatis infection. in addition to lactic acid, formic acid and acetic acid also exhibited potent chlamydiacidal activities. taken together, our findings imply that lowering the vaginal ph through engineering of  the vaginal microbiome and other means will make women less susceptible to c. trachomatis infection.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == free glycogen in vaginal fluids is associated with lactobacillus colonization and low vaginal ph.
AB  == objective: lactobacillus dominates the lower genital tract microbiota of many women, producing a low vaginal ph, and is important for healthy pregnancy outcomes and protection against several sexually transmitted pathogens. yet, factors that promote lactobacillus remain poorly understood. we hypothesized that the amount of free glycogen in the lumen of the lower genital tract is an important determinant of lactobacillus colonization and a low vaginal ph. methods: free glycogen in lavage samples was quantified. pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene was used to identify microbiota from 21 african american women collected over 8-11 years. results: free glycogen levels varied greatly between women and even in the same woman. samples with the highest free glycogen had a corresponding median genital ph that was significantly lower (ph 4.4) than those  with low glycogen (ph 5.8; p<0.001). the fraction of the microbiota consisting of lactobacillus was highest in samples with high glycogen versus those with low glycogen (median = 0.97 vs. 0.05, p<0.001). in multivariable analysis, having 1 vs. 0 male sexual partner in the past 6 months was negatively associated, while bmi >/=30 was positively associated with glycogen. high concentrations of glycogen corresponded to higher levels of l. crispatus and l. jensenii, but not l. iners. conclusion: these findings show that free glycogen in genital fluid is  associated with a genital microbiota dominated by lactobacillus, suggesting glycogen is important for maintaining genital health. treatments aimed at increasing genital free glycogen might impact lactobacillus colonization.

TI  == a simple identification method for vaginal secretions using relative quantification of lactobacillus dna.
AB  == in criminal investigations there are some cases in which identifying the presence of vaginal secretions provides crucial evidence in proving sexual assault. however, there are no methods for definitively identifying vaginal secretions. in the present study, we focused on lactobacillus levels in vaginal secretions and developed a novel identification method for vaginal secretions by relative quantification based on real time pcr. we designed a lactobacillus conserved region primer pair (lcp) by aligning 16s rrna gene sequences from major vaginal lactobacillus species (lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus jensenii), and selected the human specific  primer pair (hsp) as an endogenous control for relative quantification. as a result, the deltact (deltact=ct[lcp]-ct[hsp]) values of vaginal secretions (11 out of 12 samples) were significantly lower than those of saliva, semen and skin  surface samples, and it was possible to discriminate between vaginal secretions and other body fluids. for the one remaining sample, it was confirmed that the predominant species in the microflora was not of the lactobacillus genus. the deltact values in this study were calculated when the total dna input used from the vaginal secretions was 10pg or more. additionally, the deltact values of samples up to 6-months-old, which were kept at room temperature, remained unchanged. thus, we concluded in this study that the simple deltact method by real time pcr is a useful tool for detecting the presence of vaginal secretions.

TI  == characterization of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among women with and without bacterial vaginosis from the united states and india: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == lactobacillus species play an integral part in the health of the vaginal microbiota. we compared vaginal lactobacillus species in women from india and the usa with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv). between july 2009 and november 2010, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 40 women attending a women's health clinic in mysore, india, and a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in san francisco, usa. women were diagnosed with bv using amsel's criteria and the nugent score. lactobacillus 16s rdna was sequenced to speciate the cultured isolates. ten indian and 10 us women without bv were compared with an equal number of women with bv. lactobacilli were isolated from all healthy women, but from only 10% of indian and 50% of us women with bv. 16s rdna from 164 lactobacillus colonies was sequenced from healthy women (126 colonies) and women  with bv (38 colonies). seven cultivable lactobacillus species were isolated from  11 indian women and nine species from 15 us women. the majority of lactobacillus  species among indian women were l. crispatus (25.0%), l. jensenii (25.0%) and l.  reuteri (16.7%). among us women, l. crispatus (32.0%), l. jensenii (20.0%) and l. coleohominis (12.0%) predominated. l. jensenii and l. crispatus dominated the vaginal flora of healthy indian and us women. indian women appeared to have a higher percentage of obligate heterofermentative species, suggesting the need for a larger degree of metabolic flexibility and a more challenging vaginal environment.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == comparative functional genomics of lactobacillus spp. reveals possible mechanisms for specialization of vaginal lactobacilli to their environment.
AB  == lactobacilli are found in a wide variety of habitats. four species, lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii, are common and abundant in the  human vagina and absent from other habitats. these may be adapted to the vagina and possess characteristics enabling them to thrive in that environment. furthermore, stable codominance of multiple lactobacillus species in a single community is infrequently observed. thus, it is possible that individual vaginal  lactobacillus species possess unique characteristics that confer to them host-specific competitive advantages. we performed comparative functional genomic analyses of representatives of 25 species of lactobacillus, searching for habitat-specific traits in the genomes of the vaginal lactobacilli. we found that the genomes of the vaginal species were significantly smaller and had significantly lower gc content than those of the nonvaginal species. no protein families were found to be specific to the vaginal species analyzed, but some were either over- or underrepresented relative to nonvaginal species. we also found that within the vaginal species, each genome coded for species-specific protein families. our results suggest that even though the vaginal species show no general signatures of adaptation to the vaginal environment, each species has specific and perhaps unique ways of interacting with its environment, be it the host or other microbes in the community. these findings will serve as a foundation for further exploring the role of lactobacilli in the ecological dynamics of vaginal microbial communities and their ultimate impact on host health.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the identification and quantitation of major vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli play a key role in promoting vaginal health. depletion of these bacteria is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), the most common vaginal disorder. here we describe the development and laboratory validation of a novel single-tube multiplex taqman quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay  for the identification and quantitative assessment of the four major vaginal lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and l. iners. the assay utility was evaluated by the analysis of lactobacilli in non-cultured clinical vaginal swab specimens collected from bv patients and healthy individuals. as confirmed by the assay, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and to a lesser extent l. gasseri, are common in the vagina of healthy women, whereas l. iners dominance is associated with bv. the major assay limitation was preferential detection of dominant lactobacillus species in samples with mixed lactobacilli resulting in lower sensitivity for minor species. the multiplex qpcr assay described here is an advance in the detection and quantitation of the major vaginal lactobacilli, potentially facilitating the molecular diagnosis of bv and  post-therapy restoration of the vaginal microflora.

TI  == molecular detection of lactobacillus species in the neovagina of male-to-female transsexual women.
AB  == there is a general opinion that penile skin lined neovagina of transsexual women  is not able to support the growth of lactobacilli. this study was undertaken to prove if lactobacilli strains could survive in neovagina and to characterise the  most dominant lactobacillus species. sixty three male-to-female transsexual women without abnormal vaginal discharge, clinical signs of infection were recruited on an ongoing basis from among transsexual outpatients in an academic research institution and tertiary care centre. neovaginal smears were taken for molecular  lactobacillus spp. profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). lactobacillus species were detected from 47/63 transsexual women (75%). the 279 lactobacillus signals detected by pcr-dgge technique belonged to 13 different species. lactobacilli of the l. delbrueckii group (l. gasseri, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. iners, l. jensenii) were predominant. more than 90% of women harboured a combination of two or more neovaginal lactobacillus species. in this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.

AB  == objective: the vaginal microbiota helps protect the female genital tract from disease. we sought to describe the composition of the vaginal microbiota in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women and to explore the association between the microbiota and vulvovaginal atrophy (vva). methods: eighty-seven women (aged 35-60 y) were classified as premenopausal (n = 30), perimenopausal (n = 29), or postmenopausal (n = 28) according to stages of reproductive aging workshop guidelines. midvaginal bacterial community composition was characterized by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis. results: bacterial communities clustered into six community state types (csts), of which four were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, or lactobacillus jensenii, and two (cst iv-a and cst iv-b) had low relative abundance of lactobacillus. cst iv-a was characterized by streptococcus and prevotella, whereas cst iv-b was characterized by atopobium. there were significant associations between menopause stage and cst (p = 0.004) and between vva and cst (p = 0.002). perimenopausal women were more likely to be  classified as cst iv-a or l. gasseri cst, whereas postmenopausal women were often classified as cst iv-a. csts dominated by l. crispatus and l. iners were more prevalent in premenopausal women. nineteen participants had signs of mild or moderate vva. compared with women with no vva, the vaginal microbiota of women with mild or moderate atrophy had 25-fold greater odds of being classified as cst iv-a versus l. crispatus cst (adjusted odds ratio, 25.89; 95% credible interval,  2.98-406.79). conclusions: a distinct bacterial community state (cst iv-a) with a low relative abundance of lactobacillus is associated with vva. future studies recruiting a larger number of women are needed to replicate the findings. this study provides an impetus for future longitudinal studies designed to manage, modulate, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis, which would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship with vva and ultimately improve the treatment and prevention of atrophic vaginitis in menopause.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == influence of vaginal bacteria and d- and l-lactic acid isomers on vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer: implications for protection against upper genital tract infections.
AB  == we evaluated levels of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) in vaginal secretions in relation  to the composition of vaginal bacterial communities and d- and l-lactic acid levels. the composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 46 women was determined by pyrosequencing the v1 to v3 region of 16s rrna genes. lactobacilli  were dominant in 71.3% of the women, followed by gardnerella (17.4%), streptococcus (8.7%), and enterococcus (2.2%). of the lactobacillus-dominated communities, 51.5% were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, 36.4% by lactobacillus iners, and 6.1% each by lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. concentrations of l-lactic acid were slightly higher in lactobacillus-dominated vaginal samples, but most differences were not statistically significant. d-lactic acid levels were higher in samples containing l. crispatus than in those with l. iners (p<0.0001) or gardnerella (p=0.0002). the relative proportion of d-lactic acid in vaginal communities dominated by species of lactobacilli was in concordance with the proportions found in axenic cultures of the various species grown in vitro. levels of l-lactic acid (p<0.0001) and the ratio of l-lactic acid to d-lactic acid (p=0.0060), but not concentrations of d-lactic acid, were also correlated with emmprin concentrations. moreover, vaginal concentrations of emmprin and mmp-8 levels were highly correlated (p<0.0001). taken together, the data suggest the relative proportion of l- to d-lactic acid isomers in the vagina may influence the extent  of local emmprin production and subsequent induction of mmp-8. the expression of  these proteins may help determine the ability of bacteria to transverse the cervix and initiate upper genital tract infections. importance: a large proportion of preterm births (>50%) result from infections caused by bacteria originating in the vagina, which requires that they traverse the cervix. factors  that influence susceptibility to these infections are not well understood; however, there is evidence that matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) is known to alter the integrity of the cervix. in this work, we show that concentrations of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) are influenced by members of the vaginal microbial community and concentrations of d- or l-lactic acid isomers in vaginal secretions. elevated levels of d-lactic acid and the ratio of d- to l-lactic acid influence emmprin concentrations as well as mmp-8 levels. thus, isomers of lactic acid may function as signaling molecules that alter host gene expression and influence risk of infection-related preterm birth.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == identification and characterisation of vaginal lactobacilli from south african women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), which is highly prevalent in the african population, is one of the most common vaginal syndromes affecting women in their  reproductive age placing them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases including infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. the vaginal microbiota of  a healthy woman is often dominated by the species belonging to the genus lactobacillus namely l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners, which have been extensively studied in european populations, albeit less so in south african women. in this study, we have therefore identified the vaginal lactobacillus species in a group of 40 african women from soweto, a township on the outskirts of johannesburg, south africa. methods: identification was done by  cultivating the lactobacilli on rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and blood agar plates with 5% horse blood followed by sequencing of the 16s ribosomal dna.  bv was diagnosed on the basis of nugent scores. since some of the previous studies have shown that the lack of vaginal hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) producing lactobacilli is associated with bacterial vaginosis, the lactobacillus isolates were also characterised for their production of h2o2. results: cultivable lactobacillus species were identified in 19 out of 21 women without bv, in three  out of five women with intermediate microbiota and in eight out of 14 women with  bv. we observed that l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. gasseri and l. vaginalis were the predominant species. the presence of l. crispatus was associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p = 0.024). high level of h2o2 producing lactobacilli were more often isolated from women with normal microbiota than from the women with bv, although not to a statistically significant degree (p = 0.064). conclusion: the vaginal lactobacillus species isolated from the cohort of south african women are similar to those identified in european populations. in accordance with the other published studies, l. crispatus is related to a normal vaginal microbiota. hydrogen peroxide production was not significantly associated to the bv status which could be attributed to the limited number of samples or to other antimicrobial factors that might be involved.

TI  == lactobacillus proteins are associated with the bactericidal activity against e. coli of female genital tract secretions.
AB  == background: female genital tract secretions are bactericidal for escherichia (e.) coli ex vivo. however, the intersubject variability and molecules that contribute to this activity have not been defined. methods: the bactericidal activity and concentration of immune mediators in cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) collected from 99 healthy women were determined. results: cvl reduced the number of e. coli colonies by 68% [-26, 100] (median [range]). cvl were active against laboratory and clinical isolates of e. coli, but were inactive against lactobacillus species. bactericidal activity correlated with the concentration of protein recovered (p<0.001), but not with cytokines, chemokines or antimicrobial peptides. four cvl with>90% inhibitory activity (active) and two with<30% activity were subjected to ms/ms proteomic analysis. 215 proteins were identified and six were found exclusively in active samples. four of these corresponded to lactobacillus crispatus or jensenii proteins. moreover, culture supernatants from lactobacillus jensenii were bactericidal for e. coli. conclusion: both host and commensal microbiota proteins contribute to mucosal defense. identification of these proteins will facilitate the development of strategies to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome and prevent colonization with pathogenic bacteria such as e. coli that increase the risk for urinary tract infections, preterm labor and perinatal infection.

TI  == effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. we estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. methods: women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species atopobium vaginae, megasphaera species, leptotrichia species, sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. results: we evaluated 97 women: 71  who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. at first sampling, 22 of  26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (p>.99). g vaginalis was present in 12  of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (p>.99). among women who became sexually active, colonization with lactobacillus species remained stable:  65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (p>.99), whereas colonization with g  vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; p=.02). among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second  visits (p>.99). among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (p=.77). conclusions: among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.

TI  == phase i randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  == background: acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. this study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. methods: thirty-six sexually abstinent u.s. women were randomized to  apply acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (hec) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. the impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative pcr assays. results: the median vaginal and cervical ph was significantly lower 2 hours after application of acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of cvl against e. coli. however, 65% of women who received acidform had  at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). while there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, cvl  concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), an  anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following acidform compared to hec placebo gel application. there were no significant changes in lactobacillus crispatus or lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis in the acidform group (p = 0.08). conclusions:  acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against e. coli and a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis colonization. however, acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (il-1ra) proteins. these findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00850837.

TI  == interaction between lactobacilli, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, and hiv type 1 rna and dna genital shedding in u.s. and kenyan women.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis has been associated with genital hiv-1 shedding; however, the effect of specific vaginal bacterial species has not been assessed. we tested cervicovaginal lavage from hiv-1-seropositive women for common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and seven bv-associated species: bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, leptotrichia, sneathia, megasphaera, and atopobium spp. using quantitative pcr. we used linear and poisson regression to evaluate associations  between vaginal bacteria and genital hiv-1 rna and dna. specimens from 54 u.s. (310 visits) and 50 kenyan women (137 visits) were evaluated. controlling for plasma viral load, u.s. and kenyan women had similar rates of hiv-1 rna (19% of visits vs. 24%; irr=0.95; 95% ci 0.61, 1.49) and dna shedding (79% vs. 76%; irr=0.90; 0.78, 1.05). at visits during antiretroviral therapy (art), the likelihood of detection of hiv-1 rna shedding was greater with bvab3 (irr=3.16; 95% ci 1.36, 7.32), leptotrichia, or sneathia (irr=2.13; 1.02, 4.72), and less with l. jensenii (irr=0.39; 0.18, 0.84). at visits without art, only l. crispatus was associated with a lower likelihood of hiv-1 rna detection (irr=0.6; 0.40, 0.91). vaginal lactobacillus species were associated with lower risk of genital hiv-1 shedding, while the presence of certain bv-associated species may increase  that risk.

TI  == [lactobacillus inhibit adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells].
AB  == to assess the ability of the previously selected human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus) t79-3, t90-1 and lactobacillus jensenii (l. jensenii) t118-3, t231-1 to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and block their adhesion to hela cells. the inhibitory bioactive substances produced  by these lactobacillus were also identified. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. three types of interaction were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells: exclusion group (lactobacillus and hela followed by pathogens), competition group (lactobacillus, hela and pathogens together) and displacement group (pathogens and hela followed  by the addition of lactobacillus). the number of hela cells adhered to staphylococcus aureus was quantified by bacteria colony counts on lb plate. the results showed that lactic acids produced by the lactobacillus are the main substances that can inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and there is variation among the three types of interaction regarding the inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus. the effects of lactobacillus on blocking the adhesion to hela cells were concentration dependent. all four lactobacillus isolates displayed the ability to inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and block staphylococcus aureus adherence to hela cells. exclusion group was the most effective, and t79-3 showed greater capacity to block staphylococcus aureus adherence compared with the other three isolates. the present study suggests the  potential ability of l. crispatus t79-3 as probiotic for the treatment and prevention of urogenital infections in women.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == detection of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus species in the vagina: a comparison of culture and quantitative pcr among hiv-1 seropositive women.
AB  == background: the presence of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producing lactobacillus  in the vagina may play a role in controlling genital hiv-1 shedding. sensitive molecular methods improve our ability to characterize the vaginal microbiota; however, they cannot characterize phenotype. we assessed the concordance of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacillus detected by culture with quantitative pcr (qpcr) detection of lactobacillus species commonly assumed to be h(2)o(2)-producers. methods: samples were collected as part of a prospective cohort study of hiv-1 seropositive us women. cervicovaginal lavage specimens were tested for l. crispatus and l. jensenii using 16s rrna gene qpcr assays. vaginal swabs were cultured for lactobacillus and tested for h(2)o(2)-production. we calculated a kappa statistic to assess concordance between culture and qpcr. results: culture  and qpcr results were available for 376 visits from 57 women. lactobacilli were detected by culture at 308 (82%) visits, of which 233 of 308 (76%) produced h(2)o(2). l. crispatus and/or l. jensenii were detected at 215 (57%) visits. concordance between detection of l. crispatus and/or l. jensenii by qpcr and h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacillus by culture was 75% (kappa = 0.45). conclusions:  among hiv-1 seropositive women, there was a moderate level of concordance between h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacillus detected by culture and the presence of l. crispatus and/or l. jensenii by qpcr. however, one-quarter of samples with growth of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli did not have l. crispatus or l. jensenii detected by qpcr. this discordance may be due to the presence of other h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacillus species.

TI  == altered biomarkers of mucosal immunity and reduced vaginal lactobacillus concentrations in sexually active female adolescents.
AB  == background: genital secretions collected from adult women exhibit in vitro activity against herpes simplex virus (hsv) and escherichia coli (e. coli), but prior studies have not investigated this endogenous antimicrobial activity or its mediators in adolescent females. methodology/principal findings: anti-hsv and anti-e.coli activity were quantified from cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) specimens collected from 20 sexually active adolescent females (15-18 years). soluble immune mediators that may influence this activity were measured in cvl, and concentrations of lactobacillus jensenii and crispatus were quantified by pcr from vaginal swabs. results for adolescents were compared to those obtained from  54 healthy, premenopausal adult women. relative to specimens collected from adults, cvl collected from adolescent subjects had significantly reduced activity against e. coli and diminished concentrations of protein, igg, and iga but significantly increased anti-hsv activity and concentrations of interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-6 and il-1 receptor antagonist. vaginal swabs collected from adolescent subjects had comparable concentrations of l. crispatus but significantly reduced concentrations of l. jensenii, relative to adult swabs. conclusions/significance: biomarkers of genital mucosal innate immunity may differ substantially between sexually active adolescents and adult women. these findings warrant further study and may have significant implications for prevention of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent females.

TI  == a metagenomic approach to characterization of the vaginal microbiome signature in pregnancy.
AB  == while current major national research efforts (i.e., the nih human microbiome project) will enable comprehensive metagenomic characterization of the adult human microbiota, how and when these diverse microbial communities take up residence in the host and during reproductive life are unexplored at a population level. because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. dna was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the v5v3 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes were sequenced (454flx titanium platform). sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (otu); principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing >2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837  sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses.  although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix ph >4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific otus and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of lactobacillus species (l. iners crispatus, jensenii  and johnsonii, and the orders lactobacillales (and lactobacillaceae family), clostridiales, bacteroidales, and actinomycetales. this intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16s rrna gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.

TI  == bacterial colonization and beta defensins in the female genital tract in hiv infection.
AB  == beta defensins are antimicrobial peptides that serve to protect the host from microbial invasion at skin and mucosal surfaces. here we explore the relationships among beta defensin levels, total bacterial colonization, and colonization by bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria and lactobacilli in the female genital tract in hiv infected women and healthy controls. cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) samples were obtained from 30 hiv-infected women and 36 uninfected controls. quantitative pcr assays were used to measure dna levels of bacterial 16s ribosomal dna (reflective of total bacterial load), and levels of three bv-related bacteria, three lactobacillus species (l. crispatus, l. iners and l. jensenii), and total lactobacillus levels in cvl. levels of human beta defensins  (hbd-2 and hbd-3) were quantified by elisa. in viremic hiv+ donors, we found that cvl levels of bacterial 16s rdna were significantly increased, and inversely correlated with peripheral cd4+ t cell counts in hiv+ women, and inversely correlated with age in both hiv+ women and controls. although cvl dna levels of bv-associated bacteria tended to be increased, and cvl levels of lactobacillus dnas tended to be decreased in hiv+ donors, none of these differences was significant. cvl levels of hbd-2 and hbd-3 were correlated and were not different in hiv+ women and controls. however, significant positive correlations between hbd-3 levels and total bacterial dna levels in controls were not demonstrable in  hiv+ women; the significant positive correlations of hbd2 or hbd-3 and three lactobacillus species in controls were also not demonstrable in hiv+ women. these results suggest that hiv infection is associated with impaired regulation of innate defenses at mucosal sites.

AB  == background: the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in urogenital health.  quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for the most prevalent vaginal lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis species g. vaginalis and a. vaginae exist, but qpcr information regarding variation over time is still very limited. we set up qpcr assays for a selection of seven species and defined the temporal variation over three menstrual cycles in a healthy caucasian population with a normal nugent score. we also explored differences in qpcr data between these healthy women and an 'at risk' clinic population of caucasian, african and asian women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as defined by the nugent score. results: temporal stability of the lactobacillus species counts was high with l. crispatus counts of 108 copies/ml and l. vaginalis counts of 106 copies/ml. we identified 2 types of 'normal flora' and one 'bv type flora' with latent class analysis on the combined data of all women. the first group was particularly common in women with a normal nugent score and was characterized by a high frequency of l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, and l. vaginalis and a correspondingly low frequency of l. gasseri and a. vaginae. the second group was characterized by the predominance of l. gasseri and l. vaginalis and was found most commonly in healthy caucasian women.  the third group was commonest in women with a high nugent score but was also seen in a subset of african and asian women with a low nugent score and was characterized by the absence of lactobacillus species (except for l. iners) but the presence of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae. conclusions: we have shown that the  quantification of specific bacteria by qpcr contributes to a better description of the non-bv vaginal microbiome, but we also demonstrated that differences in populations such as risk and ethnicity also have to be taken into account. we believe that our selection of indicator organisms represents a feasible strategy  for the assessment of the vaginal microbiome and could be useful for monitoring the microbiome in safety trials of vaginal products.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == extravaginal reservoirs of vaginal bacteria as risk factors for incident bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) represents shifts in microbiota from lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate bv-associated bacteria (bvab), bv usually recurs. we investigated the role of extravaginal bvab reservoirs in recurrence. methods: risks for bv acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. dna in vaginal,  anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16s ribosomal rna genes of gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus crispatus, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, megasphaera spp., lactobacillus jensenii, and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. a case-control approach analyzed bvab detection at enrollment for case patients (bv acquisition) versus controls (none). results: of 239 women enrolled without bv, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced bv; 15 had all samples for analysis. detection of g. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. in contrast, l. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. conclusions: women who acquire bv are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some bvab, and less likely  to have l. crispatus, suggesting that bvab may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.

TI  == commensal bacteria modulate innate immune responses of vaginal epithelial cell multilayer cultures.
AB  == the human vaginal microbiome plays a critical but poorly defined role in reproductive health. vaginal microbiome alterations are associated with increased susceptibility to sexually-transmitted infections (sti) possibly due to related changes in innate defense responses from epithelial cells. study of the impact of commensal bacteria on the vaginal mucosal surface has been hindered by current vaginal epithelial cell (vec) culture systems that lack an appropriate interface  between the apical surface of stratified squamous epithelium and the air-filled vaginal lumen. therefore we developed a reproducible multilayer vec culture system with an apical (luminal) air-interface that supported colonization with selected commensal bacteria. multilayer vec developed tight-junctions and other hallmarks of the vaginal mucosa including predictable proinflammatory cytokine secretion following tlr stimulation. colonization of multilayers by common vaginal commensals including lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. rhamnosus led to intimate associations with the vec exclusively on the apical surface. vaginal commensals did not trigger cytokine secretion but staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal, was inflammatory. lactobacilli reduced cytokine secretion in an isolate-specific fashion following tlr stimulation. this tempering of inflammation offers a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to sti in the absence of common commensals and has implications for testing of potential sti preventatives.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == inhibition of hiv-1 infection in ex vivo cervical tissue model of human vagina by palmitic acid; implications for a microbicide development.
AB  == background: approximately 80% of all new hiv-1 infections are acquired through sexual contact. currently, there is no clinically approved microbicide, indicating a clear and urgent therapeutic need. we recently reported that palmitic acid (pa) is a novel and specific inhibitor of hiv-1 fusion and entry. mechanistically, pa inhibits hiv-1 infection by binding to a novel pocket on the  cd4 receptor and blocks efficient gp120-to-cd4 attachment. here, we wanted to assess the ability of pa to inhibit hiv-1 infection in cervical tissue ex vivo model of human vagina, and determine its effect on lactobacillus (l) species of probiotic vaginal flora. principal findings: our results show that treatment with 100-200 microm pa inhibited hiv-1 infection in cervical tissue by up to 50%, and  this treatment was not toxic to the tissue or to l. crispatus and jensenii species of vaginal flora. in vitro, in a cell free system that is independent of  in vivo cell associated cd4 receptor; we determined inhibition constant (ki) to be approximately 2.53 microm. significance: these results demonstrate utility of  pa as a model molecule for further preclinical development of a safe and potent hiv-1 entry microbicide inhibitor.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == [selection and genotyping of lactobacillus with potential preventive effect by repetitive element sequence-based pcr analysis].
AB  == we selected and characterized isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus)  for potential preventing infections of the female reproductive tract. we cultured vaginal swabs from healthy volunteers on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and identified the isolates at the species level by 16s rrna sequence and genotyped the isolates of lactobacillus by pcr amplification of repetitive bacterial dna elements (rep-pcr). furthermore, 10 l. crispatus strains were assessed for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and acid production. overall 65 isolates were confirmed  to be lactobacillus by sequence analogy, among them 19 were l. crispatus, 17 were lactobacillus jensenii and 12 were lactobacillus fermentum. rep-pcr produced specie and strain-specific genomic fingerprints for the lactobacillus isolates. the selected 10 l. crispatus isolates produced highly acidic environment after growth in mrs. the isolates t22-3 and t29-5 demonstrated high production of h2o2. this study indicated that there are individual differences with vaginal lactobacillus colonization, and strain diversity within vaginal l. crispatus isolates, t22-3 and t29-5 might be candidates for restoring urogenital health environment in females.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == the role of acidification in the inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  == background: vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. in bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and n. gonorrhoeae  has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. by co-cultivating n. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae. methods: three strains of  n. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/ml) of three vaginal lactobacilli (l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(n-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (mes) buffer. fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h ph and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. results: growth of f. nucleatum to >108 cfu/ml at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. all bacteria grew in  the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of mes buffer had negligible effect  on growth. l. crispatus and l. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of n. gonorrhoeae. this inhibition was abrogated by the addition of mes. l. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit n. gonorrhoeae. hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. conclusions: during anaerobic growth, inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. there was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. the acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring  protection against n. gonorrhoeae infection.

AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == candidate vaginal microbicides with activity against chlamydia trachomatis and neisseriagonorrhoeae.
AB  == vaginal microbicides with activity towards organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections have been proposed as a strategy to reduce transmission. small-molecule inhibitors of chlamydia trachomatis serovar d belonging to the class of salicylidene acylhydrazides (inps) have been shown to work through a mechanism that involves iron restriction. expanding on this work, ten inps were tested against a lymphogranuloma venereum strain of c. trachomatis (serovar l2),  neisseria gonorrhoeae, and hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. seven inps had minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations of <50 microm towards c. trachomatis l2. three inps had a mic <12.5 microm against n. gonorrhoeae. inhibition was reversed by iron, holo-transferrin and holo-lactoferrin but not by the iron-poor forms of these compounds. the compounds exhibited no bactericidal activity toward lactobacillus. the inps were not cytotoxic to hela 229 cells. when inp 0341 was tested in a mouse model of a chlamydia vaginal infection there  was a significant reduction in the number of mice shedding c. trachomatis up to 4 days after infection (p<0.01). in summary, select inps are promising vaginal microbicide candidates as they inhibit the growth of two common sexually transmitted organisms in vitro, are active in a mouse model against c. trachomatis, are not cytotoxic and do not inhibit organisms that compose the normal vaginal flora.

TI  == vaginal microbiome of reproductive-age women.
AB  == the means by which vaginal microbiomes help prevent urogenital diseases in women  and maintain health are poorly understood. to gain insight into this, the vaginal bacterial communities of 396 asymptomatic north american women who represented four ethnic groups (white, black, hispanic, and asian) were sampled and the species composition characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. the communities clustered into five groups: four were dominated by lactobacillus  iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, or l. jensenii, whereas the fifth had lower proportions of lactic acid bacteria and higher proportions of strictly anaerobic  organisms, indicating that a potential key ecological function, the production of lactic acid, seems to be conserved in all communities. the proportions of each community group varied among the four ethnic groups, and these differences were statistically significant [chi(2)(10) = 36.8, p < 0.0001]. moreover, the vaginal  ph of women in different ethnic groups also differed and was higher in hispanic (ph 5.0 +/- 0.59) and black (ph 4.7 +/- 1.04) women as compared with asian (ph 4.4 +/- 0.59) and white (ph 4.2 +/- 0.3) women. phylotypes with correlated relative abundances were found in all communities, and these patterns were associated with either high or low nugent scores, which are used as a factor for  the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. the inherent differences within and between women in different ethnic groups strongly argues for a more refined definition of the kinds of bacterial communities normally found in healthy women and the need to appreciate differences between individuals so they can be taken into account in risk assessment and disease diagnosis.

TI  == temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. this study used pcr to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methodology/principal findings: twenty-two women assessed for bv using amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for  7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative pcr assays. participants with bv were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. participants without bv had vaginal biotas dominated  by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. with onset of menstruation, quantities of lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). women with bv had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. recurrent bv was characterized by initial profound decreases of bv-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. conclusions/significance: the microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. healthy women are colonized with lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. marked increases in g. vaginalis were observed during menses. participants with bv have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. women with recurrent bv initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating bv recurrence.

AB  == lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal tract of women with and without bacterial  vaginosis (bv) were identified and characterized for the production of antagonists. bacterial samples were isolated from healthy women (n = 16), from patients with clinical complaints but without bv (n = 30), and from patients with bv (n = 32). identification was performed using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. production of antagonistic compounds was evaluated by the double-layer diffusion technique using gram-positive (n = 9) and gram-negative bacteria (n = 6) as well as yeast (n = 5) as indicator strains. of a total of 147 isolates, 133 were identified as pertaining to the genus lactobacillus. lactobacillus crispatus was the species most frequently recovered, followed by l. johnsonii and l. jensenii. statistical analysis showed that l. crispatus was more frequent in individuals without bv (p < 0.05). a higher production of antagonists was noted in l. crispatus isolates from healthy women (p < 0.05). more acidic local ph and higher h2o2 production by isolated lactobacilli from healthy women suggest these mechanisms as the possible cause of this antagonism. in conclusion, a significant correlation was detected between the presence and antagonistic properties of certain species of lactobacillus and the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == biosynthesis and degradation of h2o2 by vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal lactobacilli represents one of the most important defense mechanisms against vaginal colonization by undesirable microorganisms. to quantify the ability of a collection of 45 vaginal lactobacillus strains to generate h(2)o(2), we first compared three published colorimetric methods. it was found that the use of da-64 as a substrate rendered  the highest sensitivity, while tetramethyl-benzidine (tmb) maintained its linearity from nanomolar to millimolar h(2)o(2) concentrations. generation of h(2)o(2) was found to be especially common and strong for l. jensenii strains, while it was variable among l. crispatus and l. gasseri strains. biosynthesis of  h(2)o(2) only occurred upon agitation of the cultures, but the h(2)o(2)-producing machinery was already present in them before aeration started. calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc ions did not affect h(2)o(2) production, while cu(2+) inhibited the growth of lactobacillus jensenii cect 4306, which was chosen as a model strain. cultures with fe(3+), hemin, and hemoglobin did not accumulate h(2)o(2). fe(3+) activated an extracellular peroxidase that destroyed the h(2)o(2) being produced by the cultures. this protected the lactobacilli against  its antimicrobial effect. the production of the enzyme appears to be constitutive, the fe(3+) ions being a necessary cofactor of the reaction.

TI  == the vaginal bacterial communities of japanese women resemble those of women in other racial groups.
AB  == to determine whether different racial groups shared common types of vaginal microbiota, we characterized the composition and structure of vaginal bacterial communities in asymptomatic and apparently healthy japanese women in tokyo, japan, and compared them with those of white and black women from north america.  the composition of vaginal communities was compared based on community profiles of terminal restriction fragments of 16s rrna genes and phylogenetic analysis of  cloned 16s rrna gene sequences of the numerically dominant bacterial populations. the types of vaginal communities found in japanese women were similar to those of black and white women. as with white and black women, most vaginal communities were dominated by lactobacilli, and only four species of lactobacillus (lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus gasseri) were commonly found. communities dominated by multiple species of lactobacilli were common in japanese and white women, but rare in black women. the incidence, in japanese women, of vaginal communities with several non-lactobacillus species at moderately high frequencies was intermediate between black women and white women. the limited number of community types found  among women in different ethnic groups suggests that host genetic factors, including the innate and adaptive immune systems, may be more important in determining the species composition of vaginal bacterial communities than are cultural and behavioral differences.

TI  == identification and genotyping of bacteria from paired vaginal and rectal samples  from pregnant women indicates similarity between vaginal and rectal microflora.
AB  == background: the vaginal microflora is important for maintaining vaginal health and preventing infections of the reproductive tract. the rectum has been suggested as the major source for the colonisation of the vaginal econiche. methods: to establish whether the rectum can serve as a possible bacterial reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche, we cultured vaginal and rectal specimens from pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation, identified the  isolates to the species level with trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) and genotyped the isolates for those subjects from which the same species was isolated simultaneously vaginally and rectally, by rapd-analysis.one  vaginal and one rectal swab were collected from a total of each of 132 pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation. swabs were cultured on columbia cna agar and mrs agar. for each subject 4 colonies were selected for each of both sites, i.e.  8 colonies in total. results: among the 844 isolates that could be identified by  tdna-pcr, a total of 63 bacterial species were present, 9 (14%) only vaginally, 26 (41%) only rectally, and 28 (44%) in both vagina and rectum. a total of 121 (91.6%) of 132 vaginal samples and 51 (38.6%) of 132 rectal samples were positive for lactobacilli. l. crispatus was the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species from the vagina (40% of the subjects were positive), followed by l. jensenii (32%), l. gasseri (30%) and l. iners (11%). l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species from the rectum (15%), followed by l. jensenii (12%), l. crispatus (11%) and l. iners (2%).a total of 47 pregnant women carried the same species vaginally and rectally. this resulted in 50 vaginal/rectal pairs of the same species, for a total of eight different species. for 34 of the 50 species pairs (68%), isolates with the same genotype were present vaginally and rectally and a high level of genotypic diversity within species per subject was also established. conclusion: it can be concluded that there is a certain degree of correspondence between the vaginal and rectal microflora, not only with regard to species composition but also with regard to strain identity between vaginal and rectal isolates.these results support the hypothesis that the rectal microflora serves as a reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche.

TI  == lactobacillus equicursoris sp. nov., isolated from the faeces of a thoroughbred racehorse.
AB  == we previously isolated five strains of putative lactobacilli from the faeces of a thoroughbred horse (a 4-year-old male). of the five strains, four were identified as members of existing lactobacillus species; however, sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene revealed that the fifth isolate, di70(t), showed approximately 97 % identity (1325/1366 bp) with the type strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii. therefore, we considered the possibility that di70(t) represents a novel species  of the genus lactobacillus. cells of strain di70(t) were gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods. in phylogenetic trees constructed on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequences, strain di70(t) formed a subcluster in the l. delbrueckii phylogenetic group and was closely related to l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. however, analysis of dna-dna relatedness showed that di70(t) was genetically distinct from its phylogenetic relatives. the isolate also exhibited distinct biochemical and physiological characteristics when compared with its phylogenetic relatives. it required anaerobic conditions for growth on agar medium. the results indicate that isolate di70(t) indeed represents a novel species of the genus lactobacillus, for which we propose the name lactobacillus equicursoris sp. nov.  the type strain is di70(t) (=jcm 14600(t) =dsm 19284(t)).

TI  == [prevalence and characterization of vaginal lactobacillus species in women at reproductive age without vulvovaginitis].
AB  == purpose: to identify species of lactobacillus isolated from the vaginal contents  of healthy and asymptomatic women, determining the most prevalent species and characterizing them phenotypically. methods: lactobacillus have been isolated in  selective milieu from samples of the vaginal contents of 135 women without complaints of vaginal secretion, and with negative laboratorial diagnosis of vaginal infection, followed up at an outpatient clinic. after being identified by multiplex pcr, the isolates have been submitted to rnar 16s gene sequencing, when necessary. they have also been evaluated concerning the production of lactic acid, h2o2, bacteriocins and the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. results:  eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, l. crispatus (30.1%), l. jensenii (26.5%), l. gasseri (22.9%) e l. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. only 20 of those isolates did not present h2o2 production, in  detectable amounts. from the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the  epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. none of the tested strains produced bacteriocins. conclusions: the lactobacillus species more prevalent in women without vulvovaginitis, isolated in selective culture milieu and identified by molecular methods were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. besides the fact of being more prevalent, these strains also presented better production of h2o2, and reached lower ph values in the culture milieu.

TI  == characterization of indigenous vaginal lactobacilli from healthy women as probiotic candidates.
AB  == the probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. of these, 21 strains were classified as l. crispatus, 17 as l. jensenii, six as l. gasseri, and one as l. plantarum. the rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. none used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. h2o2  generation was common, especially among l. jensenii isolates (88%). no bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. one of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. all strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.

AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == [vaginal microbiota: composition, protective role, associated pathologies, and therapeutic perspectives].
AB  == vaginal microbiota, mainly comprised of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and  l. gasseri, protect the mucosa against the establishment of pathogenic microorganisms through three complementary mechanisms: a) specific adherence to the epithelium, which blocks colonization of pathogens, b) production of antimicrobial compounds, and c) co-aggregation with pathogens, which enhances their microbiocidal effect. despite these mechanisms, vaginal microbiota are sometimes displaced by undesirable microorganisms, which is associated with the development of bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis due to candida spp., trichomoniasis, and lower urinary tract infections. on rare occasions, lactobacilli cause disease, but exclusively in immunocompromised patients. the main conditions are bacteremia (about 50% of the cases) and endocarditis (30%). however, no genital pathology caused by lactobacilli has been reported. the mutualistic effect of lactobacilli suggests that instillation of these microorganisms might regenerate the vaginal ecosystem, thus eliminating the relapses associated with treatment of the infection.

TI  == the human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of hiv infection. cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (bv). pcr methods have shown that women with bv have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla bacteroidetes and actinobacteria. healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. the microbiology of bv is heterogeneous. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with bv suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == association between lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria, and bacterial vaginosis scores in pregnant japanese women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), the etiology of which is still uncertain, increases the risk of preterm birth. recent pcr-based studies suggested that bv is associated with complex vaginal bacterial communities, including many newly recognized bacterial species in non-pregnant women. methods: to examine whether these bacteria are also involved in bv in pregnant japanese women, vaginal fluid  samples were taken from 132 women, classified as normal (n = 98), intermediate (n = 21), or bv (n = 13) using the nugent gram stain criteria, and studied. dna extracted from these samples was analyzed for bacterial sequences of any lactobacillus, four lactobacillus species, and four bv-related bacteria by pcr with primers for 16s ribosomal dna including a universal lactobacillus primer, lactobacillus species-specific primers for l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and l. iners, and bv-related bacterium-specific primers for bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium. results: the prevalences of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. gasseri were significantly higher, while those of  bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium were significantly lower in the normal group than in the bv group. unlike other lactobacillus species, the prevalence of l. iners did not differ between the three groups and women with l. iners were significantly more likely to have bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium. linear regression analysis revealed associations of bvab2 and megasphaera with nugent score, and multivariate regression analyses suggested a close relationship between eggerthella-like bacterium and bv. conclusion: the bv-related bacteria, including bvab2, megasphaera, leptotrichia, and eggerthella-like bacterium, are common in the vagina of pregnant japanese women with bv. the presence of l. iners may be correlated with vaginal colonization by these bv-related bacteria.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  == lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection  and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the  growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis,  l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == why nonoxynol-9 may have failed to prevent acquisition of neisseria gonorrhoeae in clinical trials.
AB  == objectives: to understand why clinical trials failed to demonstrate efficacy of nonoxynol-9 in preventing gonorrhea. goal: to test the hypothesis that nonoyxnol-9 failed to prevent acquisition of neisseria gonorrhoeae because most isolates are resistant to killing by nonoyxnol-9 at the level attainable with intravaginal use. study: the lowest concentrations of nonoxynol-9 required to kill or inhibit growth of clinical isolates of n gonorrhoeae and lactobacillus were determined. results: most strains (17 of 25) of n gonorrhoeae (68%) were resistant to the highest concentration of nonoxynol-9 tested (20%). l crispatus (100%), l jensenii (90%), and l iners (79%) were also resistant to nonoxynol-9. conclusions: n gonorrhoeae and h2o2-producing strains of vaginal lactobacilli were not killed by nonoxynol-9 at concentrations greater than those achievable in vivo. earlier studies that formed the basis for subsequent trials most likely did not detect resistance because too few isolates were evaluated. large numbers of clinical isolates should be examined before the initiation of clinical trial using microbicidal products.

TI  == colonization of the rectum by lactobacillus species and decreased risk of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == lactobacilli colonizing the rectum may be a reservoir for vaginal lactobacilli. in a cross-sectional study of 531 females, vaginal and rectal colonization by lactobacilli were assessed by culture methods. a subset of isolates was identified to the species level by use of whole-chromosomal dna probes. lactobacillus crispatus (16%), l. jensenii (10%), and l. gasseri (10%) were the prevalent lactobacilli colonizing the rectums of 290 females. only 13 (9%) of 147 females colonized by l. crispatus or l. jensenii vaginally and/or rectally had bacterial vaginosis (bv), compared with 12 (44%) of 27 females colonized by other h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli (p < .001). cocolonization of the vagina and rectum by h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli was associated with the lowest prevalence of bv (5%), whereas females colonized only vaginally, only rectally, or at neither site had a successively increased risk of bv (p < .001). lactobacillus species in the rectum may contribute to the maintenance of vaginal  microflora.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis--a microbiological and immunological enigma.

TI  == identification and h(2)o(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.
AB  == lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. previous reports have also suggested that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. we report the identification and h(2)o(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we also report the correlation between identification and h(2)o(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. lactobacilli were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. h(2)o(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. the most commonly isolated species were l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. vaginalis and l. jensenii. amounts of h(2)o(2)  produced by lactobacilli varied widely. the presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of h(2)o(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and  subsequent chorioamnionitis. l. jensenii and l. vaginalis produced the highest levels of h(2)o(2). we postulate that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.

TI  == dna fingerprinting of lactobacillus crispatus strain ctv-05 by repetitive element sequence-based pcr analysis in a pilot study of vaginal colonization.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus is one of the predominant hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2))-producing species found in the vagina and is under development as a probiotic for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. in this study, we assessed whether dna fingerprinting by repetitive element sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) can be used to distinguish the capsule strain of l. crispatus (ctv-05) from other endogenous strains as well as other species of vaginal lactobacilli. vaginal and  rectal lactobacilli were identified to the species level by using whole-chromosome probe dna hybridization. the dnas from l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, and an as-yet-unnamed h(2)o(2)-negative lactobacillus species designated 1086v were subjected to rep-pcr. the results of gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the dna fingerprints obtained were compared. l. crispatus ctv-05 had a unique dna fingerprint compared to all other lactobacilli. dna fingerprints for 27 production lots of l. crispatus sampled from 1994 through 2001 were identical to that of the original strain isolated in 1993, suggesting strain stability. in a pilot study of nine women, this dna fingerprinting method distinguished ctv-05 from other endogenous vaginal lactobacilli prior to and after vaginal capsule use. rep-pcr dna fingerprinting is useful for strain typing and for evaluating longitudinal loss or acquisition of vaginal lactobacilli used as probiotics.

AB  == the present study aimed to characterize lactobacilli in vaginal fluid from 23 adult healthy women by using high-throughput dna sequencing for identification of a large number of randomly selected colonies appearing on rogosa and blood agar.  the typing method was based on broad-range pcr of 16s rrna gene variable regions  v1 and v3, pyrosequencing, and classification of the fragments by alignment with  ncbi-catalogued sequences and type strain sequences. four major groups of sequences were found among the 402 isolates clearly corresponding to lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus jensenii when compared to the sequences obtained for type strains.  our results indicate that pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments as used here  is a fast and reliable method well suited for identification to the species level, even within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.

TI  == antimicrobial components of vaginal fluid.
AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy swedish women.
AB  == species of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between  studies. however, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the l. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of nugent et al. (r. p. nugent, m. a. krohn, and s. l. hillier, j. clin. microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex pcr, and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. the vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single rapd type, but five of them harbored two rapd types representing two different species or strains. the most frequently occurring species were lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. l. iners  has not previously been reported as one of the predominant lactobacillus species  in the vagina.

AB  == to identify factors that predict sustained colonization by vaginal lactobacilli,  microbiologic, behavioral, and demographic data were obtained from 101 nonpregnant women at baseline and at 4 and 8 months. a total of 272 isolates of lactobacilli were identified to the species level by use of whole chromosomal dna homology to type strains. the predominant lactobacilli were the species lactobacillus crispatus (38%) and l. jensenii (41%). of 57 women initially colonized by h(2)o(2)-producing l. crispatus or l. jensenii, 23 (40%) remained colonized over 8 months, compared with 1 (5%) of 21 women colonized by other h(2)o(2)-producing species or by h(2)o(2)-negative strains (p=.01). frequency of  sexual intercourse (> or =1 sex act per week) was associated with loss of colonization with h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli (p=.018), as was antibiotic use (p< or =.0001). other behavioral and demographic characteristics did not predict  sustained colonization. the production of h(2)o(2) is closely linked with species and is a predictor for sustained long-term colonization of the vagina.

TI  == comparative study of vaginal lactobacillus phages isolated from women in the united states and turkey: prevalence, morphology, host range, and dna homology.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health. however, during bacterial vaginosis lactobacilli decrease for unknown reasons. our preliminary study showed that phages could infect vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution, virulence, and  types of vaginal lactobacillus phages isolated from women of two countries: the united states and turkey. a total of 209 vaginal lactobacilli were isolated from  reproductive-aged women in the united states (n = 107) and turkey (n = 102). by analysis of 16s rrna gene sequence and by comparison of protein profiles, most lactobacilli were identified as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, and l. jensenii. after  mitomycin c induction, 28% of american lactobacilli and 36% of turkish lactobacilli released phages. a total of 67 phages were isolated and further characterized by their host range, electron microscopy, and dna homology. all 67  phages were infective against lactobacilli from both collections. the host ranges of most phages were broad, including multiple lactobacillus species. even though  the phages were all temperate, they were able to cause lytic infection in various strains. the electron micrographs of these phages showed a hexagon-shaped head and a long tail with or without a contractile tail sheath. based on their morphology, these phages belonged to bradley's phage groups a and b, and could be further classified into four morphotypes. all four types were found among american phages, but only three were found among turkish isolates. dna hybridization with labeled probes of the four types of phages revealed that additional genetic types existed within each morphotype among these phages. the phage genomic sizes ranged between 34 and 55 kb. many of the lysogenic lactobacillus strains released phages spontaneously at a high frequency of 10(-3) to 10(-4) pfu/cell. in conclusion, lysogeny in vaginal lactobacilli is widely spread. some lysogenic lactobacilli spontaneously release phages with a broad host range, which can be lytic against other vaginal lactobacilli regardless of their geographic origin.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

AB  == the systematics of the lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (molin et al. 1992). one-hundred-twenty-two lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of lactobacillus and leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. data were examined using jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% sj-similarity level: cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. crispatus, and to some extent to l. acidophilus. cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as l. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. the genomic homogeneity of the l. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna, and the isolates could  be divided into six genomic strains.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  == in the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to l. acidophilus atcc 4356. strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus gasseri, l. jensenii and l. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as l. fermentum. moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.
