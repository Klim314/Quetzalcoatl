TI  == isolation, characterization, and identification of biological control agent for potato soft rot in bangladesh.
AB  == a total of 91 isolates of probable antagonistic bacteria of potato soft rot bacterium erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (ecc) were extracted from rhizospheres and endophytes of various crop plants, different soil varieties, and atmospheres in the potato farming areas of bangladesh. antibacterial activity of  the isolated probable antagonistic bacteria was tested in vitro against the previously identified most common and most virulent soft rot causing bacterial strain ecc p-138. only two isolates e-45 and e-65 significantly inhibited the in  vitro growth of ecc p-138. physiological, biochemical, and carbon source utilization tests identified isolate e-65 as a member of the genus bacillus and the isolate e-45 as lactobacillus sp. the stronger antagonistic activity against  ecc p-138 was found in e-65 in vitro screening and storage potatoes. e-65 reduced the soft rot infection to 22-week storage potatoes of different varieties by 32.5-62.5% in model experiment, demonstrating its strong potential to be used as  an effective biological control agent for the major pectolytic bacteria ecc. the  highest (62.5%) antagonistic effect of e-65 was observed in the granola and the lowest (32.7%) of that was found in the cardinal varieties of the bangladeshi potatoes. the findings suggest that isolate e-65 could be exploited as a biocontrol agent for potato tubers.

TI  == aiia-mediated quorum quenching does not affect virulence or toxoflavin expression in burkholderia glumae sl2376.
AB  == aim: the primary objective of this study was to determine the effects of quorum quenching in the pathogenicity and toxoflavin production of burkholderia glumae causing bacterial rice grain rot. methods and results: an acyl-homoserine lactonase (aiia) gene from bacillus sp. was expressed in b. glumae under the control of a constitutive promoter. acyl-homoserine lactone production in the aiia-transformants was reduced significantly, and the aiia-expressing b. glumae strain reduced the severity of soft rot when the strain was co-inoculated with a  soft-rot pathogen, pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum scci. however, the aiia-transformant still caused rice seedling rot and rice grain rot. the aiia-expressing strains had wild-type levels of transcription from the genes in the toxoflavin biosynthetic operon, and as well as wild-type levels of toxin production. conclusions: our results show that aiia-mediated quorum quenching does not affect virulence or toxoflavin production in b. glumae. significance and impact of the study: indirect quorum quenching may prove an ineffective approach  to the control of rice grain rot, because it reduces, but does not eliminate entirely homoserine lactones in b. glumae. virulence of rice grain rot was retained despite reduction in homoserine lactones by the expression of aiia in b. glumae.

TI  == the identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  == in an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including alternaria alternata, aspergillus flavus, a. niger, eurotium chevalieri, fusarium moniliforme, penicillium sp., rhizopus stolonifer, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida tropicalis, geotrichum candidum, rhodotorula glutinis and kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and atcc cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, e. coli, pectobacterium carotovorum, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. results indicated that all fungal isolates except for rh. glutinis and r. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas r. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. all bacterial isolates from fresh produce, p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and  p. fluorescens (atcc baa-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/l) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/l). p.  aeruginosa (atcc 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. p. carotovorum, e. coli, b. cereus and staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.

TI  == detection and characterization of bacteria from the potato rhizosphere degrading  n-acyl-homoserine lactone.
AB  == quorum sensing plays a role in the regulation of soft rot diseases caused by the  plant pathogenic bacterium pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. the signal molecules involved in quorum sensing in p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum  belong to the group of n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls). in our study, we screened bacteria isolated from the potato rhizosphere for the ability to degrade ahls produced by p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. six isolates able to degrade  ahls were selected for further studies. according to 16s rdna sequence analysis and fatty acid methyl ester profiling, the isolates belonged to the genera ochrobactrum, rhodococcus, pseudomonas, bacillus, and delftia. for the genera ochrobactrum and delftia, for the first time ahl-degrading isolates were found. data presented in this study revealed for the first time that ochrobactrum sp. strain a44 showed the capacity to inactivate various synthetic ahl molecules; the substituted ahls were inactivated with a lower efficiency than the unsubstituted  ahls. compared with the other isolates, a44 was very effective in the degradation of ahls produced by p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. it was verified by polymerase chain reaction, dna-dna hybridization, and a lactone ring reconstruction assay that ochrobactrum sp. strain a44 did not possess ahl lactonase activity. ahl degradation in ochrobactrum sp. strain a44 occurred intracellularly; it was not found in the culture supernatant. ahl-degrading activity of a44 was thermo sensitive. experiments in planta revealed that ochrobactrum sp. strain a44 significantly inhibited the maceration of potato tuber tissue. since a44 did not produce antibiotics, the attenuation of the decay might be due to the quenching of quorum- sensing-regulated production of pectinolytic enzymes. the strain can potentially serve to control p. carotovorum  subsp. carotovorum in potato.

TI  == ahld, an n-acylhomoserine lactonase in arthrobacter sp., and predicted homologues in other bacteria.
AB  == quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria. with the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating ahl, bacteria were screened for ahl degradation by their ability to utilize n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) as the sole carbon source. among four isolates, strain ibn110, identified as arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on ohhl, and to degrade various ahls with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. co-culture of arthrobacter sp. ibn110 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the ahl amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying arthrobacter sp. ibn110 in the control of ahl-producing pathogenic bacteria. the ahld gene from arthrobacter sp. ibn110 encoding the enzyme catalysing ahl degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. a mass spectrometry analysis showed that ahld probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of n-3-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, indicating that ahld is an n-acylhomoserine lactonase (ahlase). a comparison of ahld with other known ahl-degrading enzymes,  bacillus sp. 240b1 aiia, a bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis aiia homologue and agrobacterium tumefaciens attm, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. although these identities were relatively low, the hxdh approximately h approximately d motif was conserved in all the ahlases, suggesting that this motif is essential for ahlase activity. from a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative ahld-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and ahl-degrading activities were observed in klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus stearothermophilus. furthermore, it was verified that ahlk, an ahld homologue, encodes an ahl-degrading enzyme in k. pneumoniae. accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that ahld-like ahlases could exist in many other  micro-organisms.

TI  == genes encoding the n-acyl homoserine lactone-degrading enzyme are widespread in many subspecies of bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria can communicate with each other by n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), which are quorum-sensing autoinducers. recently, the aiia gene (encoding an enzyme catalyzing the degradation of ahl) has been cloned from bacillus sp. strain 240b1. during investigations in the course of the ongoing bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni genome project, an aiia homologue gene in the genome sequence was found. these results led to consideration of the possibility of the widespread existence of the gene in b. thuringiensis. aiia homologue genes were found in 16 subspecies of b. thuringiensis, and their sequences were determined. comparison of the bacillus sp. strain 240b1 aiia gene  with the b. thuringiensis aiia homologue genes showed high homologies of 89 to 95% and 90 to 96% in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence, respectively. among the subspecies of b. thuringiensis having an aiia gene, the subspecies aizawai, galleriae, kurstaki, kyushuensis, ostriniae, and subtoxicus were shown to degrade ahl. it was observed that recombinant escherichia coli producing aiia proteins also had ahl-degrading activity and could also attenuate  the plant pathogenicity of erwinia carotovora. these results indicate that insecticidal b. thuringiensis strains might have potential to compete with gram-negative bacteria in natural ecosystems by autoinducer-degrading activity.

TI  == aiia, an enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone quorum-sensing signal and attenuates the virulence of erwinia carotovora.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones, known as autoinducers (ais), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. ais are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions, including expression of pathogenic genes in the plant pathogens pseudomonas solanacearum, several erwinia species, and the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. a bacterial isolate, bacillus sp. 240b1, is capable of enzymatic inactivation of ais. the gene (aiia) for ai inactivation from bacillus sp. 240b1  has been cloned and shown to encode a protein of 250 amino acids. sequence alignment indicates that aiia contains a "hxhxdh" zinc-binding motif that is conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. site-directed mutagenesis showed that conserved aspartate and most histidine residues are required for aiia activity. expression of aiia in transformed erwinia carotovora strain scg1 significantly reduces the release of ai, decreases extracellular pectolytic enzyme activities, and attenuates pathogenicity on potato, eggplant, chinese cabbage, carrot, celery, cauliflower, and tobacco. our results indicate that the  ai-inactivation approach represents a promising strategy for prevention of diseases in which virulence is regulated by ais.
