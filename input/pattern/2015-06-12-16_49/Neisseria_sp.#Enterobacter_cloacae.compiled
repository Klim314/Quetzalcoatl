TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
