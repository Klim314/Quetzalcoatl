TI  == human-specific bacterial pore-forming toxins induce programmed necrosis in erythrocytes.
AB  == a subgroup of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) family of pore-forming toxins (pfts) has an unusually narrow host range due to a requirement for binding to human cd59 (hcd59), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-linked complement regulatory molecule. hcd59-specific cdcs are produced by several organisms that inhabit human mucosal surfaces and can act as pathogens, including gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus intermedius. the consequences and potential selective advantages of such pft host limitation have remained unknown. here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, pft ligation of hcd59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing  hcd59. because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, rbcs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. rbc programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on fas/fasl signaling and rip1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. death due to programmed necrosis in rbcs  is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, nadph oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. bacterial pfts that are hcd59 independent do not induce rbc programmed necrosis. rbc programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature rbcs. importantly, rbc programmed necrosis enhances the growth of pft-producing pathogens during exposure to primary rbcs, consistent with a role for such signaling in microbial growth and pathogenesis. importance: in this work, we provide the first description of a new form of programmed cell death in erythrocytes (rbcs) that occurs as a consequence of cellular attack by human-specific bacterial toxins. by defining a new rbc death pathway that shares  important components with necroptosis, a programmed necrosis module that occurs in nucleated cells, these findings expand our understanding of rbc biology and rbc-pathogen interactions. in addition, our work provides a link between cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) host restriction and promotion of bacterial growth in the presence of rbcs, which may provide a selective advantage to human-associated bacterial strains that elaborate such toxins and a potential explanation for the narrowing of host range observed in this toxin family.

TI  == a deeper analysis of the epitope/paratope of ply-5, a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognises the conserved undecapeptide tryptophan-rich loop (ectglawewwr) of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == a previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the ply-5 mab in the conserved undecapeptide trp-rich loop of bacterial cdcs should consist of wewwrt (jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second trp and the arg residues  are essential in the ply-5 epitope. the e residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. for recognition by the antibody, the trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. the displaced second trp was seen  to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue  mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.

TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal g. vaginalis  in both genders. from a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with  a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. at least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). s. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. g. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.

TI  == bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == pcr primers and probes for the 16s rrna gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

TI  == a collaborative study of the in-vitro sensitivity to rp 59500 of bacteria isolated in seven hospitals in france.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500 was determined against 1051 recent clinical bacterial isolates. the susceptibility to rp 59500 was determined with an agar dilution technique for all the isolates, while mics and mbcs were determined for  82 selected strains in broth. isolates of both staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared to be potentially susceptible to rp 59500, independent of susceptibility to methicillin or mls resistance. (s. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, mic90, 1.0 mg/l; methicillin-resistant, mic90 1.0  mg/l; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, mic90 0.5 mg/l). lancefield group a, b, c and g streptococci (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) appeared to be susceptible to rp 59500. some streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of rp 59500 (enterococci: mic90 4 mg/l, range 0.125-16 mg/l). comparatively low mics were seen when legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and gardnerella vaginalis were tested. broth dilution mic/mbc determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as mic values were within two dilutions of mbc values. rp 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ramoplanin (mdl 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. the analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. we retrospectively subjected 69  samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. the results obtained from chromatographic analysis  are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.
