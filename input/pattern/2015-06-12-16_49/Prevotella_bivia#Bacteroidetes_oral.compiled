TI  - Inguinal syndrome secondary to Prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  - The authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Streptococcus constellatus and Prevotella bivia penile abscess.
AB  - Streptococcus constellatus (S. constellatus) is known to cause abscesses in the oral, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts, frequently in association with anaerobic bacteria. We report a rare case of S. constellatus and Prevotella bivia (P. bivia) causing a penile abscess, which was successfully treated with surgical drainage and antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. Inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. Against two azithromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (MIC=0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. All three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin MIC=4.0 microg/ml). Both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (Finegoldia [Peptostreptococcus] magna Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella bivia, and Prevotella melaninogenica). Moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both Prevotella species. In this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. These findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - In a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. Predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-Lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin Etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. At least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. Prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of 10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). No beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in Porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). All the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the Etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.
TI  - Proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - Subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. Their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. To determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota, we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. Eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). After three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. Proteolytic activity (U/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. It was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited, and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than in control (peptone broth). Among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. The frequent occurrence of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. Albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. It is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. Enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.
TI  - Fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  - 88 strains of five Prevotella species--P. bivia, P. buccae, P. disiens, P. oralis, and P. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. Beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. The oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. The urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with P. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than P. disiens. Within the oral species group, P. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did P. buccae and P. oris. The finding of species-related different binding properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, P. bivia and P. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, P. buccae, P. oralis, and P. oris. Moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of Prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.
TI  - In vitro activities of E1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - E1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. E1101 was the most active agent against S. agalactiae and E. coli. Since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, E1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of DU-6859a and other fluoroquinolones against  Japanese isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis. DU-6859a was the most active agent; it inhibited 90% of isolates of almost all species tested, including Bacteroides fragilis at < or = 0.39 micrograms/mL. Although the other quinolones tested were active against gram-positive anaerobes, inhibiting their growth at < or = 1.56 micrograms/mL, these agents were less active against the B. fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (90% of which were inhibited at > or = 6.25 micrograms/mL). Mobiluncus species and G. vaginalis, which are well associated with bacterial vaginosis, were inhibited by DU-6859a at 0.1 microgram/mL. These results suggest that DU-6859a is a promising oral agent for the treatment of bacterial infections due to anaerobic bacteria; however, further studies, including determination of vaginal levels of this compound, should be performed to study the role of DU-6859a in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
