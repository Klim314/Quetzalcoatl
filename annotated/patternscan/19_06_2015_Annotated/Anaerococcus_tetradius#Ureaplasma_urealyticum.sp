TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == [the microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis as a cause of tubal sterility].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most widespread disturbances of the normal state of the vagina of women of reproductive and menopausal age. this condition is highly disregarded due to its moderate and not always clear clinical manifestation. the disturbed proportion of microorganisms in vagina is shown in the strong decrease or lack of lactobacilli and a spread of associated with bacterial vaginosis microorganisms. g. vaginalis, mobiluncis spp., bacteroides spp. (without b. fragilis), peptostreptococcus spp., mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum. the condition is a predisposition to a disturbance of natural defense mechanisms and to a spread of infectious agents towards the upper female genital tract. this is a predisposition for the development of tubal patency and motility disorders, ovarian function disturbances, endometrites. the  treatment of this condition as an important step in female sterility prophylaxis  is commented.

TI  == [the influence of anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma isolated from the genital tract on mast cell activation].
AB  == nowadays, it is known that mast cells, numerously appearing in all organs and being a source of a wide range of mediators and cytokines, are involved both in physiological and pathological processes. the aim of our study was to examine whether vaginal bacteria, especially those participating in bacterial vaginosis,  are able to activate mast cells to mediators secretion. the study was done on rat peritoneal mast cells. the mast cells were incubated in vitro with suspensions of bacteroides capillosus, actinomyces naeslundii (2 strains), peptostreptococcus spp., lactobacillus fermentum (2 strains), mycoplasma hominis or ureaplasma urealyticum killed by temperature. activation of mast cells was estimated on the  basis of histamine release. it was established that m. hominis, u. urealyticum and b. capillosus strongly stimulated rat mast cells to histamine secretion (histamine release 53.0%, 17.4% and 10.0%, respectively). histamine release induced by peptostreptococcus spp., a. naeslundii and l. fermentum was lower (at  a range of 2.4%-8.2%). the obtained results can suggest that presumably interactions between vaginal bacteria and placental mast cells could influence the course of pregnancy.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was first reported in 1995 by gardner and dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. they also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed gardnerella vaginalis. bv is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. bv has a complex microbiology. lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes g. vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods such as prevotella species, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the  syndrome, raising the vaginal ph and producing a discharge odor. the excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. results from epidemiologic studies have associated bv with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. in particular, the  presence of bv in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that bv is a cause of preterm delivery. the interest in potential invasiveness of g. vaginalis has increased. however, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. the most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == changes in vaginal flora during pregnancy and association with preterm birth.
AB  == a prospective study of the vaginal flora changes between midtrimester and labor was undertaken in 560 women; 337 had intact membranes and were in labor when swabs were taken. of these, 45 delivered preterm. gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum (both associated with preterm birth when present in midtrimester), and mycoplasma hominis commonly persisted between midtrimester and labor, particularly in the preterm cohort (24 [65%] of 37 midtrimester isolates), and these organisms were seldom acquired late in pregnancy. a second group, bacteroides species, had both a high persistence (9 [60%] of 15 midtrimester isolates) and high late acquisition rate (10 [53%] of 19 labor isolates) in the preterm cohort. these findings provide a rationale for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. a third group, comprising enteropharyngeal bacteria and peptostreptococcus species, were almost all acquired late in the preterm cohort (14 [88%] of 16 labor isolates), and persistence from midtrimester was rare.

TI  == the microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. the major members of the group are gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas and bacteroides, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. facultative species of lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. the exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. the high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == infection and labor. vii. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in spontaneous rupture of membranes at term.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, microbiologic characteristics, and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with premature rupture of membranes at term. study design: amniocentesis was performed in 32 women with term premature rupture of membranes and amniotic fluid cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. results: the prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 34.3% (11/32). the most common isolates were ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp., bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium sp. clinical chorioamnionitis occurred only in one patient with a positive amniotic fluid culture. her neonate had ophthalmitis. three patients (9.4%) had endometritis. among women who were delivered vaginally, those with a positive amniotic fluid culture had a significantly higher rate of endometritis than those with a negative culture (33% [3/9] vs 0% [0/20], respectively, p = 0.023). conclusions: these data indicate that microbial invasion of the amniotic  cavity occurs in approximately one third of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is a risk factor  for endometritis in women with term premature rupture of membranes.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
