TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. in 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic  evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline hcl-containing fibers. clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (m) after treatment. standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, m3, and one  year after treatment. two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. the remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (m1, p<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. in comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (p<0.001). no significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. the radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. at m1, m3 and m6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (p<0.001).  a significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium sp., bacteroides forsythus, and campylobacter rectus (p<0.01). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. in conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  == forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. the subgingival plaque  samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to  other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. the results showed porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with bacteroides forsythus. peptostreptococcus sp., actinomyces sp. and prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in  the healthy subjects.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

TI  == activities of hmr 3004 (ru 64004) and hmr 3647 (ru 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite  pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.
