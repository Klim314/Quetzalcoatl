TI  - Epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern Cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of PCR-enhanced surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern Cameroon. METHODS:  Health professionals collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients presenting with clinical symptoms of meningitis. Specimens were tested using gram stain, latex agglutination test, and culture. A PCR assay completed the diagnostic testing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on some Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) isolates. RESULTS: From 2007 through 2010, of the 1429 CSF specimens tested, 292 (20.4%) were positive, either for Nm (205), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (57), or Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) (30). From 2007 through 2009, the serogroup W135 represented 98.8% of 164 case isolates. Until 2008, most serogroup W135 isolates presented the sequence-type ST-2881 usually associated with sporadic cases. Since 2009, the ST-11 (an epidemic-associated clone) became predominant, although no epidemic occurred. Serogroup A ST-7 was observed in 2010 and caused a localized epidemic. Using the detection PCR on turbid CSF, a 2.7-fold increase in cases with etiologic diagnosis was obtained, compared to culture. All tested meningococcal isolates (42) were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cefotaxim. CONCLUSIONS: Resurgence of serogroup A and recent increase in ST-11 among serogroup W135 isolates were worrying when considered with the epidemic wave of serogroup A meningitis, which affected neighboring countries and the serogroup W135 epidemic in Niger in 2009-2010.
TI  - The formyl peptide receptor like-1 and scavenger receptor MARCO are involved in glial cell activation in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that the scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) mediates activation of the immune response in bacterial infection of the central nervous system (CNS). The chemotactic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) formyl-peptide-receptor like-1 (FPRL1) plays an essential role in the inflammatory responses of host defence mechanisms and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin CRAMP/LL-37 is up-regulated in bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms underlying CRAMP expression are far from clear. METHODS: Using a rat meningitis model, we investigated the influence of MARCO and FPRL1 on rCRAMP (rat cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide) expression after infection with bacterial supernatants of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Neisseria meningitides (NM). Expression of FPRL1 and MARCO was analyzed by immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR in a rat meningitis model. Furthermore, we examined the receptor involvement by real-time RT-PCR, extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and cAMP level measurement in glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and transfected HEK293 cells using receptor deactivation by antagonists. Receptors were inhibited by small interference RNA and the consequences in NM- and SP-induced Camp (rCRAMP gene) expression and signal transduction were determined. RESULTS: We show an NM-induced increase of MARCO expression by immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR in glial and meningeal cells. Receptor deactivation by antagonists and small interfering RNA (siRNA) verified the importance of FPRL1 and MARCO for NM- and SP-induced Camp and interleukin-1beta expression in glial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated a functional interaction between FPRL1 and MARCO in NM-induced signalling by real-time RT-PCR, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cAMP level measurement and show differences between NM- or SP-induced signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that NM and SP induce glial cell activation and rCRAMP expression also via FPRL1 and MARCO. Thus the receptors contribute an important part to the host defence against infection.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. Currently, the most promising candidates in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. Besides the anti-malarial activity, SP is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as IPTp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. METHODS: In this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. RESULTS: SP was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All tested Gram-positive bacteria, except Enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. Additionally, azithromycin was active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: These data indicate important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. Given the large scale use of IPTp in Africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - African meningitis belt pneumococcal disease epidemiology indicates a need for an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine, including for older children and adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine strategies in GAVI-eligible countries  are focusing on infant immunization but this strategy may not be optimal in all settings. We aimed to collect all available population based data on pneumococcal meningitis throughout life in the African meningitis belt and then to model overall meningitis risk to help inform vaccine policy. METHODS: After a systematic review of literature published from 1970 through the present, we found robust population-based Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) meningitis data across age strata for four African meningitis belt countries that included 35 surveillance years spanning from 1970 to 2005. Using these data we modeled disease risk for a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 persons followed throughout life. RESULTS: Similar to meningococcal meningitis, laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis was seasonal, occurring primarily in the dry season. The mean annual Sp meningitis incidence rates were 98, 7.8 to 14, and 5.8 to 12 per 100,000 among persons <1, 1 through 19, and 20 to 99 years of age, respectively, which (in the absence of major epidemics) were higher than meningococcal meningitis incidences for persons less than 1 and over 20 years of age. Mean Sp meningitis case fatality ratios (CFR) among hospitalized patients ranged from 36-66% depending on the age group, with CFR exceeding 60% for all age groups beyond 40 years; depending on the age group, Sp meningitis mortality incidences were 2 to 12-fold greater than those for meningococcal meningitis. The lifetime risks of pneumococcal meningitis disease and death were 0.6% (1 in 170) and 0.3% (1 in 304), respectively. The incidences of these outcomes were highest among children age <1 year. However, the cumulative risk was highest among persons age 5 to 59 years who experienced 59% of pneumococcal meningitis outcomes. After age 5 years and depending on the country, 59-79% of meningitis cases were caused by serotype 1. CONCLUSIONS: In the African meningitis belt, Sp is as important a cause of meningitis as Neisseria meningitidis, particularly among older children and working age adults. The meningitis belt population needs an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine and policy discussions should consider vaccine use outside of early childhood.
TI  - [Antibiotic management of pediatric presumptive bacterial meningitis (rational, methods, course, and follow-up)].
AB  - The epidemiology of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis in children in  industrialized nations was greatly modified because of recommended vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and in some countries against Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) group C. However, most cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by SP and Nm most frequently group B, which validates the first intention use of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone combined or not with vancomycin according to the probability of pneumococcal resistance.
TI  - Adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  - A wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. Hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have been described with several neonatal infections. We studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. The infections diagnosed included Neisseria meningitidies, group A streptococcus, Rickettsia rickettsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ehrlichia sp., Bacillus anthracis, Leptospira sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., Legionella sp., Yersinia pestis, and Treponema pallidum. Bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. Bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with N. meningitidis, four with R. rickettsii, four with S. pneumoniae, three with group A streptococcus, two with S. aureus, two with B. anthracis, one with T. pallidum, and one with Legionella sp. Bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). Hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. Bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. Although N. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.
TI  - A pneumococcal MerR-like regulator and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  - A transcriptional regulator, NmlR(sp), has been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (NO) stress. The nmlR(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhC, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase that is able to reduce S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) with NADH as reductant. nmlR(sp) and adhC mutants exhibited a reduced level of NADH-GSNO oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by NO than were wild-type cells. Comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that NmlR(sp) and AdhC do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. An intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both NmlR(sp) and AdhC were required for survival in blood. These data identify novel components of a NO defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.
TI  - Regulation of constitutive and microbial pathogen-induced human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene expression.
AB  - The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important regulator of innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis. However, four decades after its identification, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the MIF gene remain largely unknown. Analyses of human monocytic (THP-1), epithelial (HeLa and A549) and keratinocytic (HaCat) cells transfected with wild-type, truncated and mutated MIF promoter reporter constructs, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and siRNA inhibition indicated that the transcription factors specificity protein (Sp)1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are critical positive regulators of constitutive human MIF gene expression. Albeit located in a cytosine guanine dinucleotide island, the MIF gene was found to be hypomethylated, an observation consistent with high baseline transcriptional activity. Moreover, stimulation of THP-1 cells and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with microbial products up-regulated phosphorylated Sp1 nuclear content, Sp1 DNA-binding activity, MIF promoter activity and MIF mRNA levels in a MEK1/2-, Sp1-dependent manner. Taken together with previous observations of an important role for MIF in pro-inflammatory macrophage responses, these present findings suggest a key role for Sp1 and CREB in transcriptional regulation of MIF gene expression and MIF-dependent host antimicrobial innate immune defense.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis among children, in Manhica, a rural area in Southern Mozambique.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is one of the most severe diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although data for the continent is very limited, more than one million cases are estimated per year, with mortality and life-long sequelae occurring in 50% of these cases. METHODS: As part of the clinical management of children admitted to the Manhica District Hospital, information on cases of ABM was recorded. We analysed data from June 1998 to November 2003. RESULTS: During the study period, 475 cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 20,173 children <15 years of age admitted to hospital. Culture results confirmed 71 (15%) cases of ABM. The most prevalent bacterial aetiologies were Streptotoccus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, n=31), Haemophilus influenzae (n=13) and Neisseria meningitis (n=8). Other important bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (n=7), Salmonella sp. (n=4) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=3). Crude incidence rates of ABM and pneumococcal meningitis were 20/100,000 and 10/100,000 children-year-at-risk, respectively. Incidences were more than three times higher in the <1 year age group. Overall case fatality rate was 36%, and was highest for H. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis (55% and 45%, respectively, p=0.044). Pneumococcal susceptibility was 81% for oxacillin and 93% for chloramphenicol. For H. influenzae isolates, susceptibility was 54% for ampicillin and 62% for chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are the main aetiologies responsible for the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with ABM in rural Mozambique. These findings are important to evaluate treatment guidelines and potential impact of control measures.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis at the 'Complexe Pediatrique' of Bangui, Central African Republic.
AB  - To precis the aetiologies of children meningitis and the susceptibility to antibiotics of bacteria responsible for meningitis in Bangui, we conducted a prospective study between October 2004 and September 2005, at the 'Complexe Pediatrique de Bangui', Central African Republic (CAR). Children from 1 day to 16 years with suspected meningitis and who underwent a lumbar puncture were enrolled. Gram staining, culture on chocolate blood medium, cell count, biochemistry (protein level, glucose ratio), capsular antigen detection were performed for each cerebrospinal fluid. MICs were determined by the E-test method. Four hundred and seventeen patients were enrolled during the study period; 130 were proven acute bacterial meningitis and 37 probable bacterial meningitis. Among proven bacterial meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism responsible for meningitis (62 cases, 48%) followed by Haemophilus influenzae (46 cases, 35%) and by Neisseria meningitidis and Salmonella sp. (8 cases, 6% each). Ninety-four percent and 96% of S. pneumoniae strains tested remain susceptible to benzylpenicilline and chloramphenicol, respectively. A beta-lactamase was detected in 92% of H. influenzae strains tested. However, MICs 50% and 90% for amoxicillin were found to be 1 and 4 mg/l, respectively and 33% of these strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. The global mortality rate was 35% (59/167). This mortality rate was 47% for S. pneumoniae, 33% for H. influenzae, 62% for Salmonella sp. and 13% for N. meningitidis. The probabilistic treatment with ampicillin and chloramphenicol usually administered for children meningitis in Bangui must be reconsidered particularly in cases of H. influenzae meningitis. It is of importance to reduce the presentation delays of children with suspected meningitis in Bangui. The H. influenzae b immunization would allow a dramatic reduction of meningitis cases and deaths in Central African children.
TI  - Intranasal vaccines for protection against respiratory and systemic bacterial infections.
AB  - More than 4 million deaths per year are due to respiratory diseases. Although licensed vaccines are available, bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bordetella pertussis and Neisseria meningiditis, among others, continue to be the major agents of diseases in young children, the elderly and/or immunocompromized individuals. Following respiratory tract infection, some microorganisms may also invade the epithelial tissue, achieving systemic circulation and/or other organs. Nasal administration of different antigen formulations has shown promising results in the induction of immune responses and the defeat of the pathogens at the site of infection. This review will focus on the main nasal vaccine strategies and technologies being investigated against the most common infections caused by respiratory bacteria.
TI  - Antineoplastic Agents. 554. The manitoba bacterium Streptomyces sp.
AB  - A Streptomyces sp. isolated from riverbank soil in Manitoba, Canada, was found to contain two cancer cell growth inhibitories: diazaanthraquinone 1 and 3-(hydroxyacetyl)indole (8). The structures were determined by interpretation of data from HRMS, UV, and high-field (400 MHz) NMR experiments. The red-colored diazaanthraquinone 1 and 3-(hydroxyacetyl)indole (8) were found to inhibit (0.1-3 microg/mL) growth of a minipanel of human cancer cell lines and P388 lymphocytic leukemia cells. Diazaanthraquinone 1 was also found to inhibit growth of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrheae. However, three companion constituents, cyclo-Pro-Leu (5), cyclo-Pro-Phe (6), and cyclo-Pro-Val (7), did not inhibit cancer cell growth.
TI  - Bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural Yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in Yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the Arabian Peninsula. The objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with ABM, prior to the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in Yemen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of Yemen. All patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between May 1999 and June 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultured, were included in the study. Clinical information from case notes, including CSF result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. Analysis of extracted data was performed using Epi Info software. RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. In the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), 23 (15%) H. influenzae (HI), 81 (52.9) Neisseria meningitidis (NM), 2 (1.3%) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) Escherichia coli. Sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. Ten deaths were due to SP meningitis, 2 HI meningitis, 3 NM meningitis, and 1 had S. aureus. Of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. SP meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had HI meningitis. Among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (CFR 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors developed permanent complications. Of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 HI tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 SP isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G, respectively, and the majority of the 81 NM isolates were sensitive to both. The 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood ABM were SP and NM. SP meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.
TI  - Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  - Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. The MIC90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Morexella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella sp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Clamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), Listeria sp., most Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. menigitidis, Pasteurella spp., Vibrio spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica. For Mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia sp., Serratia sp., P. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive Gram-negative rods, MIC90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. For anaerobic bacteria species, MIC90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. Moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the MIC and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. There is a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. Animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the MIC and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. Various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. Human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. A single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h, AUC of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 L/kg. Protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (M-1 and M-2). Bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. No dose modification is required in renal impairment. Extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. At present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with MICs of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. The safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.
TI  - [Investigate of nasopharyngeal flora in infants and children with influenza].
AB  - To clarify the bacteriological interpretation of nasopharyngeal flora from infants and children with influenza (n = 38), nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. From 38 patients, 83 strains of bacterias were obtained. Chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were B. catarrhalis (28 strains), S. pneumoniae (22 strains), H. influenzae (19 strains), S. aureus (6 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were Corynebacterium spp. and alpha-streptococcus (3 strains each) and Moraxella sp (2 strains). From infants and children without influenza (n = 34), 83 strains were obtained. The chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were B. catarrhalis (23 strains), H. influenzae (22 strains), S. pneumoniae (18 strains), S. aureus (7 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were Corynebacterium spp. and Moraxella sp (5 strains each), alpha-streptococcus (2 strains) and Neisseria sp (1 strain). There was no significant difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza. In cases showing detection of multiple bacterial strains, common combinations were one or more of B. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus and nonpathogenic or weakly pathogenic bacteria. There was also no significant difference in combinations of nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and those without influenza. We emphasize that we must study whether a difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza develops with time. Therefore, we must repeatedly obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza.
TI  - [Etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, and to compare it to those reported for other communities.METHODS: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from January 1992 to July 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, Gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.RESULTS: The etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: Haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, Neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%, and others agents in 6.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the Santa Lydia Hospital of Ribeirao Preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with Haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. The study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the agent may become difficult.
TI  - Etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis among children in Egypt.
AB  - PURPOSE: Surveillance for patients with meningitis is a high priority in order to determine the etiology of disease and design prevention strategies. This study presents data on the causes of bacterial meningitis among children <6 years of age treated in a network of hospitals throughout Egypt. METHODS: Training was provided to standardize the collection of clinical information and optimize recovery of bacterial pathogens. Bacterial isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance patterns using Kirby Bauer disk diffusion, E-test and/or Beta-lactamase (BL) testing methods. RESULTS: Patients with culture-confirmed bacterial meningitis (228 children<6 years) were identified including 89 (39%) patients with H. influenzae (HI), 68 (30%) with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), 30 (13%) with N. meningitidis (NM), 18 (8%) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and 23 (10%) with other bacteria. The overall case fatality ratio was high (24%) and increased among children with TB meningitis (56%). The susceptibility for HI to ampicillin (AMP), chloramphenicol (C) and ceftriaxone (CRO) was 21%, 13%, and 100% respectively. The susceptibility for SP to C and CRO was 79% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HI and SP are the leading causes of bacterial meningitis among children in Egypt. The majority of HI strains tested were resistant to AMP or C suggesting the need for routine use of CRO as first line therapy. Among older children TB emerges as a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in Egypt.
TI  - [Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Splenectomy performed at any age and for any reason increases the risk for death due to overwhelming infection. AIM: To evaluate definition, etiology, incidence, risk factors and prophylaxis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, as well as the methods related to splenic tissue preservation when total splenectomy is necessary. METHOD: Bibliographic review. RESULTS: The etiological agents more frequently found are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and type B, and Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria like Escherichia coli, Streptococcus b-hemolytic, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp represent a significant risk as well. In addition, a great variety of agents including other enteric Gram-negative microorganisms and non-bacteria pathogens can also be sporadically identified. The prophylaxis is based on three main aspects: patient's education, immune prophylaxis and chemical prophylaxis. However these are not enough to prevent the higher risk of developing sepsis. When total splenectomy is unavoidable, heterotopic splenic autotransplantation seems to be the only alternative for splenic tissue preservation. According to clinical and experimental studies, the splenic autotransplanted tissue present a similar structure to a normal spleen and preserve the splenic immune function. CONCLUSIONS: The high risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, reduced the indication for total splenectomy, in trauma and several diseases. Prophylactic methods have been developed to minimize the effects of the sepsis. Several researches have been done to determine the immunocompetence of autogenous splenic grafts in response to bacteria invasion.
TI  - Heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine conjugated to outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup b and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) is an important bacterial pathogen in children. Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization of S. pneumoniae is necessary for person-to-person transmission and often precedes invasive disease. METHODS: NP carriage of Sp was studied in 49 infants following administration of a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) conjugated to the outer membrane protein of serogroup b Neisseria meningitidis (vaccine serotypes: 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F). The vaccine was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and carriage rates were compared to a concurrent group of 32 infants not given PCV and evaluated over the first 15 months of life. RESULTS: Overall, Sp was isolated in 86/367 (23%) of NP cultures and 49% of infants. Serotype 23F was significantly less prevalent in the PCV group (1.9%) than the control group (16.1%) (P<0.05). Analysis of the proportion of children with prevalent carriage or acquisition of carriage did not differ between groups when evaluated by age or serotype. We noted, however, decreased acquisition and carriage in the vaccine group 1 month following the 12 month dose of PCV for vaccine serotypes (76 and 52% reduction, respectively), but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.3). Adjustment for age, daycare and antibiotic use by multivariate modeling revealed no difference in carriage of vaccine containing serotypes or non-vaccine serotypes between groups. CONCLUSION: We did not show a significant effect of this heptavalent PCV on NP carriage. Further study of this issue, including a larger population size, is needed.
TI  - Employment of broad-range 16S rRNA PCR to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method for the rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples from 40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including Neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16S rRNA PCR in conjunction with PAGE and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific PCR employing ABI TaqMan technology for N. meningitidis. Analysis of clinical specimens employing 16S rRNA PCR yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial DNA. Species-specific PCR yielded 30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for N. meningitidis. Prior to separation by PAGE, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16S rRNA PCR amplicons. Following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for N. meningitidis and three specimens positive for Acinetobacter sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One specimen was positive for both N. meningitidis and Streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for N. meningitidis and Pseudomonas sp., by broad-range PCR. Seven clinical specimens were negative for N. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant DNA. This study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16S rRNA PCR amplicons using a combination of PAGE and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. Adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16S rRNA PCR.
TI  - [Investigate of nasopharyngeal flora in highly aged patients].
AB  - To clarify the bacteriological interpretation of flora in the nasopharynx of highly aged patients (n = 107), healthy nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from subjects of advanced age. Chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (43 strains), Corynebacterium spp. (14 strains), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production and non-production) (16 strains), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production) (6 strains). Chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were alpha-streptococcus (14 strains), Neisseria sp (3 strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis which are the chief bacteria isolated from children, demonstrated only 3 strains for each bacteria. In cases showing detection of multiple detected bacteria, common combinations were non-pathogenic bacteria and weakly pathogenic bacteria and enteric bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. The differences between nasopharyngeal flora of children and highly aged persons are suspected to be due to the differences in immunological and anatomical factors. We should actively examine these factors in highly aged subjects.
TI  - Microbiology of the middle meatus: a comparison between normal adults and children.
AB  - Middle meatal samples were obtained from 52 carefully selected healthy adults. In 75 per cent of the test subjects bacterial organisms were cultured. However, growth was often poor and the predominant species suggest a commensal flora: coagulase-negative staphylococci were retrieved from 35 per cent, Corynebacterium sp. from 23 per cent and Staphyloccus aureus from eight per cent of the adults. These data are very different from those previously obtained among children where--even in the absence of obvious ENT pathology--the most frequently cultured organisms were typical sinusitis pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae present in 40 per cent, Moraxella catarrhalis in 34 per cent and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 50 per cent of children. Furthermore, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria sp., both organisms that might be able to inhibit colonization by some of the pathogens and found commonly among children, are virtually absent in healthy adults.
TI  - Designing meningitis vaccines.
AB  - Conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are a recent intervention to combat the relative inability of young children to mount an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, especially Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp). These organisms cause the majority of community acquired septicaemia and meningitis in UK children. Their capsular polysaccharides, important virulence factors in evading phagocytosis, are poorly immunogenic in young children compared to adults. Conjugation, by covalent linking, of the polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein, has been demonstrated for each of these organisms to produce good antibody response to the polysaccharide. Conjugate Hib vaccines have proven effective in reducing Hib meningitis and invasive disease in the countries that have introduced them. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven effective in preventing invasive disease caused by serotypes contained in the vaccines. Efficacy studies are awaited for meningococcal conjugate vaccines.
TI  - Rifampin, a useful drug for nonmycobacterial infections.
AB  - Rifampin has clinical efficacy against a wide variety of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, group A Streptococcus, Brucella sp, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as in vitro activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Haemophilus ducreyi, and many gram-negative rods. Rifampin is a useful drug for several types of bacterial infections because of its broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and low side effect profile. In combination with other antibiotics, it may be effective when conventional therapies are not.
TI  - [Analysis of prognosis of bronchopulmonary infectious disease with lung cancer].
AB  - Bronchopulmonary infection affects the prognosis of lung cancer patients. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the prognosis of bronchopulmonary infectious diseases and their causative bacteria isolated by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) in lung cancer patients. In the present study, we determined which factor is more predisposing for the outcome of bronchopulmonary infections, the type of causative bacteria or the host nutritional status. A total of 107 lung cancer patients, which consisted of 105 males and 5 females (mean age 67.3 +/- 8.0), were included in this study. The study was conducted from 1981 to 1994. They were classified into the survival group and the deceased group. Causative agents of infection were compared between these 2 groups. S. pneumoniae, alpha-Streptococcus sp., M. catarrhalis, and Neisseria sp. were predominant in organisms isolated from TTA-specimens of lung cancer patients with bronchopulmonary infections, regardless of prognosis. Nutritional status, as determined by serum levels of cholinesterase, albumin, and cholesterol, was poor in the deceased group than in the survival group. These results indicate that the outcome of bronchopulmonary infections in lung cancer patients are affected mainly by the nutritional status of the host.
TI  - [A clinical study of chronic lower respiratory infection with Haemophilus influenza by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  - We have performed a clinical study on chronic lower respiratory tract infection (CLRTI) with Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) and analyzed clinical factors of the acute exacerbation. In 40 episodes (38 cases) of H. influenzae isolated from CLRTI, monobacterial infection with H. influenzae were 21 episodes and polymicrobial infection were 19 episodes. We classified the disease into acute exacerbated (27 episodes) and stable (13 episodes) phase and the former episodes were divided into bronchitis type (7 episodes) and pneumonia type (20 episodes). Polymicrobial infections were seen more in the pneumonia type (13 episodes) than in the bronchitis type (2 episodes). The principal organism detected with H. influenzae were alpha-Streptococcus and Neisseria sp. in the bronchitis type and S. pneumoniae in the pneumonia type. The acute exacerbated cases were divided into the following 4 patterns; 1. polymicrobial infection with continuous infection of P. aeruginosa, 2. monomicrobial infection after acute upper respiratory tract infection, 3. polymicrobial infection with S. pneumoniae after continuous infection of H. influenzae, 4. bacterial replacement by P. aeruginosa after acute exacerbation. The results of the study suggests that polymicrobial infection is an important chronic lower respiratory tract infection when caused H. influenzae.
TI  - [Bacteremia in 13 general hospitals of the province of Barcelona. Prospective study of 1,674 episodes. Group of Microbiologists of the County Hospitals of Catalonia].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and microbiological description of bacteremias seen in 13 regional hospitals of Barcelona. METHODS: From January to December of 1991 a multicenter prospective study of bacteremia in regional hospitals was performed. The filiation, clinical findings and microbiological results were registered according to a common protocol. RESULTS: We studied 1674 episodes of bacteremia (13.8 per 1000 admissions). Patients were distributed into 3 groups according to age: under 14: 204 patients, between 14 to 65: 759 and over 65: 711 patients. Men account for 55% and women for 45% of episodes. The bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 24.4% of cases. The most common foci of infection were: urinary tract (32%), respiratory tract (14%), intestinal tract (8%), intravascular catheter (7%), biliary tract (7%) and unknown (10%). The most commonly isolated strains were: Escherichia coli 544 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae 212, Staphylococcus aureus 139, coagulase negative staphylococi 85, Non-typhoid Salmonella 66, Neisseria meningitidis 63, Pseudomonas sp. 59, Enterococcus sp. 59 and Bacteroides sp. 58. Polimicrobial bacteremia was detected in 83 episodes (5%). Related mortality rate was 9.6% (161 patients).
TI  - Development of a collection of bacteria causing meningitis in Rio de Janeiro from 1990 to 1991.
AB  - From March 1990 to December 1992, the National Institute for Quality Control of Health-INCQS Research Collection received 1476 bacterial samples isolated from human cerebrospinal fluid of patients suspect of meningitis in Rio de Janeiro, from the Sao Sebastiao State Institute of Infectious Diseases (IEISS). Neisseria meningitidis was found in most of these materials, followed in smaller number by Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The great majority of N. meningitidis strains was serogroup B, followed by serogroup C and a few strains of serogroup W135. More than 50% of the isolated bacterial agents came from the predominant 0-4 years age group. The majority of the strains were from patients in the region known as "Baixada Fluminense" (Low Lands). The aim of the work presented here is to obtain samples of meningitis cases in at least 70% of the State of Rio de Janeiro and develop a collaborative research between INCQS-FIOCRUZ and the IEISS, in order to set up a collection of strains for future studies. However, despite work being carried out in a rather satisfactory way, difficulties still arise and have to be overcome, to survey data.
TI  - Rapid organism identification from Bactec NR blood culture media in a diagnostic  microbiology laboratory.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate rapid organism identification on positive blood culture Bactec  NR media (phial types 26, 27, 42 and 17), and to assess the usefulness of these procedures in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty, first positive, blood culture bottles from individual patients were tested by rapid identification methods selected on the basis of Gram film organism morphology. Tube coagulase and latex agglutination were applied to presumptive staphylococci; latex agglutination antigen detection methods to suspected pneumococci, Neisseria and Haemophilus sp; and latex agglutination grouping tests for cultures thought to be non-pneumococcal streptococci. RESULTS: Media type did not influence test performance (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Misapplication of methods occurred on eight occasions and there were 14 false positive results, nine involving the latex reagents for group C streptococci and pneumococci. The positive predictive values for tube coagulase tests and latex reactions for H influenzae type b, and N meningitidis groups B and C were 100%. The pneumococcal and staphylococcal latex tests gave positive predictive values of 94.1% and 62.5%, respectively, and the corresponding figure for streptococcal grouping reactions was 75.9%. With the exception of staphylococcal latex testing (80%) all investigation negative predictive values were > 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the staphylococcal latex agglutination method was unsatisfactory and it is not appropriate for use with the media studied. In view of the cross-reactions observed with the tests used to identify group C streptococci and pneumococci, positive findings must be interpreted with caution. In all other regards the protocol evaluated produced rapid, reliable, clinically useful information and, subject to local experience, is recommended to users of Bactec NR media.
TI  - Production and immunochemical characterization of Neisseria meningitidis group B  antiserum for the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.
AB  - Unlike Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, Y and W135, the group B capsular polysaccharide has been shown to be chemically and immunologically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K1. Both components are sialic acid homopolymers and are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, due to the high incidence of Neisseria meningitidis group B meningitis in the population of the State of Sao Paulo, preparing antiserum to this serogroup for diagnostic purposes has become a matter of high priority. Of the many immunization schemes proposed, intravenous inoculation of whole bacteria previously inactivated with formaldehyde and simultaneous intradermal inoculation with a mixture of the bacterial polysaccharide fraction and whole bacteria in complete Freund;s adjuvant have produced the best results. The antiserum was treated with immunoadsorbents prepared with aluminum chloride and protein and/or polysaccharide antigens from each of the following heterologous bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli other than K1, and Staphylococcus aureus, in order to eliminate cross-reactivity. For quality control analysis, the antiserum was assessed by the immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, dot-ELISA, and immuno-blot techniques against homologous antigens. Specificity was obtained after treating the antiserum with Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide immunosorbent.
TI  - [The cerebrospinal fluid in bacterial meningitis].
AB  - Samples of 1815 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were studied in a meningitis outbreak during 1989 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Neisseria meningitis 56% with 44% type B, Haemophilus influenzae 17%, from which 72% in children (days to 3-year-old) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 14% from which 60% in children (day to 1-year-old) of 443 (24%) of all strains. Cytochemistry study showed: purulent or turbidity aspects in 70 to 79% positive bacterioscopy or culture of CSF; white cells count > 500/mm3; glucose < 45 mg/dl; protein > 90 mg/dl in 90% of all patients. We concluded that: CSF prognostic factors: (aspect and cytochemistry) were correlated with bacterial meningitis. Bacterioscopy and positive cultures were correlated to NM, SP and HI isolation from these patients (Goodman Test).
TI  - [Antibiotherapy as first choice in infectious meningitis].
AB  - The choice of antibiotics in bacterial meningitis must integrate several parameters. i) The bacterial epidemiology of community acquired meningitis: Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) represents more than 95% of cases; ii) The increase of antibiotic bacterial resistance, particularly preoccupying for Sp; iii) The microbiological properties and pharmacokinetics of antibiotics, especially their penetration in CSF: the concentrations achieved must be several times higher than the MBC. In fact, CSF is not favourable to the antibiotic activity; iv) The results of clinical comparative trials; v) The contribution of animal models to the knowledge of meningitis physiopathology. Third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) satisfy this objective for Hi, Nm, and penicillin sensitive strains of Sp. For penicillin resistant Sp, no treatment can achieve antibiotic CSF concentrations higher than ten times the MBC. An increase in dosage of cephalosporins, the use of an other regimen (Vancomycin or imipenem) and antibiotic association (rifamycin, fosfomycin) are needed.
TI  - [Quantitative analyses of the normal throat flora of children with upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Relationship between the normal throat flora and pathogenic bacteria recovered from the throat in 139 children with upper respiratory tract infections in winter were studied using quantitative analyses. Pathogenic bacteria examined include S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae, and the normal floras include alpha-streptococci, gamma-streptococci, Neisseria species, and Micrococci. Children with S. pyogenes in their throats (S. pyogenes group) were examined with anti-streptococcal antibodies such as anti-streptolysin O, anti-streptokinase, and anti-deoxyribonuclease B. Eighty seven pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 72 children (51.8%) out of 139. S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae groups showed significantly lower alpha-streptococci and gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance when compared with children with the no pathogenic bacteria in their throats (no bacteria group). H. influenzae group showed significantly lower gamma-streptococci and higher Neisseria sp. in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. Positive cases for anti-streptococcal antibodies showed a significantly lower alpha-streptococci in number compared with negative cases for antibodies and the no bacteria group, and a significantly lower gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. These data suggest that the normal throat flora may have a role in prevention of colonization by the pathogenic bacteria in vivo, as were shown in vitro by many authors, and that the quantitative analysis of the normal flora is useful because this methodology might reveal whether the bacteria recovered from the throat show the pathogenicity.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of quinolones.
AB  - The quinolones are new antimicrobial agents that are descendants of nalidixic acid. As a new class of synthetic antimicrobials they exhibit a wide spectrum of activity. Newer quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin are highly active against gram negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus ducreyi. They exhibit less activity against Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus sp., and little in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Enterococci. Their activity against Mycobacterium sp. is variable, and obligate anaerobes are usually considered resistant. Of the quinolones reviewed, ciprofloxacin displays the highest degree of in vitro activity.
TI  - [Latex agglutination tests of the cerebrospinal fluid in bacterial meningitis: an analysis of 333 cases].
AB  - The study is based on 333 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial meningites. The aim of the study is a critical evaluation on latex agglutination tests in CSF for H. influenzae type b, N. meningitidis A and C, and S. pneumoniae. These tests are compared with direct examination (Gram method), and culture results. It was shown that results of the latex test in the CSF are basic for rapid diagnosis of etiological agent in a bacterial meningitis. Data on 106 CSF samples confirmed the etiology through latex tests in 98.2% for H. influenzae type b, in 15.8% for N. meningitidis A or C, in 96.8% for S. pneumoniae. Emphasis is given for evidence of antibiotic therapy previous to CSF collection, which may be responsible for the great number of negative results registered in the present series.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 127,391, an enhanced-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant strains. The MICs of PD 127,391 against 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of PD 127,391 per ml. Against most strains, PD 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against B. fragilis. Strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including PD 127,391. The MIC and minimum lethal concentration of PD 127,391 against three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the MIC against 90% of 21 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. PD 127,391 was less active at pH 5, its maximal activity being at pH 7 to 8. The presence of urine at pH 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. The protein binding of PD 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. The protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. However, urine at pH 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at pH 7.0
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Assessment of a commonly available latex particle agglutination test in rapid, bacteriologic cerebrospinal fluid diagnosis].
AB  - 36 cerebrospinal fluid specimens (CSF) from patients with bacterial meningitis were tested for the presence of bacterial antigens with the "Slidex Meningite Kit" (Bio Merieux). This kit has latex particles coated with antibodies against hemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and neisseria meningitidis (NM) group A and C. With the LAT we could detect the bacterial antigens in 84% of bacterial meningitis cases, 23 of the 27 of Hib meningitis (85.2%), all of the 6 cases of SP meningitis (100%) and two of the three NM meningitis cases. The test is handicapped by the fact, that there is no antiserum against NM sero-group B, the main cause of NM meningitis in Austria. There were no false positive results with the LAT. False negative results were obtained in 19.2% of Hib and in one case of NM. Even under sufficient antibiotic therapy and with negative culture we could detect 9 Hib- and 1 NM-cases during the first 12-48 hours of therapy with this method. The LAT-Kit is a useful addition to standard methods of CSF examinations in bacterial meningitis. With the LAT a rapid bacteriological diagnosis is possible within 15 minutes. The Kit is also able to identify bacterial antigens even with negative culture and after initiation of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - [Prospective evaluation of coagglutination and latex agglutination in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in childhood].
AB  - Two simple and low-priced kits to detect bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients with suspected meningitis have recently become available. Methods employed by these kits are staphylococcal coagglutination (COA) and latex agglutination (LA). The COA "Phadebact CSF-kit" (Pharmacia) detects Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIb), Neisseria meningitidis (NM) groups A, B, C, Y and W 135 and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), whereas the LA "Slidex Meningite-kit" (BioMerieux) includes HIb, NM A, NM C and SP. These two diagnostic tests were compared with the standard methods for analyzing CSF specimens from children with suspected meningitis. A total of 336 CSF specimens were tested. Forty-three were from children with bacterial meningitis due to HIb, NM or SP obtained before antimicrobial therapy. Thirty-four of them (79%) were correctly detected by COA, 23 (54%) by LA, and 42 (97%) by microscopic analysis of stained smears. There were 65 CSF samples of such meningitis cases obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy: COA detected 26 (40%), LA 17 (26%) and staining 26 (40%). With culture-positive CSF specimens from patients before therapy, the best sensitivities were obtained with LA for SP (100%) and COA for HIb (87%), whereas the results for NM antigen detection were only 43% with COA and 0% with LA (no reagent against NM B). Cross-reactions with other bacterial antigens were frequent with COA (26%) and rare with LA (2%), resulting in false-positive findings in 6 of the 66 positive tests with COA (9%) but in none of the 40 positive tests with LA (0%). One of the 48 specimens from aseptic meningitis cases was false-positive for HIb by COA, whereas all 172 normal specimens were negative with both methods. With 5 culture-negative CSF specimens from patients with unequivocal purulent meningitis COA detected bacterial antigen in 5 and LA in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The two kits evaluated cannot replace standard methods for analyzing CSF specimens, in view of insufficient sensitivity (mainly LA) or frequent cross-reactions and false-positive values (COA). However, due to their simplicity, rapidity, and possible identification of bacterial pathogens after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, these kits are recommended as an useful addition to standard methods.
TI  - [Rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  - The occurence of Haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. H. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. The capsule of H. Influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of H. influenzae and 28% of H. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.
TI  - Spenolimycin, a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic. III. Biological properties.
AB  - Spenolimycin is a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces gilvospiralis sp. nov. In vitro, it was active against a wide variety of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was two to four-fold more active against N. gonorrhoeae than spectinomycin. Spenolimycin was effective in the standard mouse protection test against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - An evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  - Latex particle agglutination (LPA) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. Capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hi b), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), Streptococcus agalactiae (Sa) and Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) groups A and C. An adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. Antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. Antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous LPA reagent was available. Fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no LPA reagent was available. LPA was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease in children.
TI  - The bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - The bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. Thirty-five percent of these chronic effusions were culture-positive. Type b and non-type b Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. Serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. In addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the Gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; Gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. Disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. Effusions which yielded H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded S. epidermidis or Neisseria or were sterile. Phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on Gram stain. Phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. The results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - [Allergization of the body by Neisseria meningitidis. I. The problem of the occurrence of N. meningitidis in cases of bronchial asthma of bacterial etiology (author's transl)].
AB  - The object of the authors work was the examination of nasopharyngeal swabs on the prevalence of Neisseria meningitidis. A group of 222 patients suffering from asthma bronchiale of bacteriological etiology was under observation in order to be able to prepare an autovaccine. Nasopharyngeal swabs were inoculated on special nutrient media. Neisseria meningitidis was found in 22%, mainly from nasopharyngeal swabs, together with Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 59% of examined cases the positive findings lasted longer than 1 year. 46% of isolated strains belonged to group B, about 30% of strains were untypable. The problem of allergisation of people suffering from asthma bronchiale with these strains and the question of preparing an autovaccine from Neisseria meningitidis is discussed.
