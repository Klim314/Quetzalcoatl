TI  - Bacillus megaterium has both a functional BluB protein required for DMB synthesis and a related flavoprotein that forms a stable radical species.
AB  - Despite the extensive study of the biosynthesis of the complex molecule B12 (cobalamin), the mechanism by which the lower ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) is formed has remained something of a mystery. However, recent work has identified and characterized a DMB-synthase (BluB) responsible for the oxygen-dependent, single enzyme conversion of FMN to DMB. In this work, we have identified BluB homologs from the aerobic purple, nonsulfur, photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus and the aerobic soil bacterium Bacillus megaterium and have demonstrated DMB synthesis by the use of a novel complementation assay in which a B12 deficient strain, substituted with the precursor cobinamide is recovered either by the addition of DMB or by the recombinant expression of a bluB gene. The DMB-synthetic activity of the purified recombinant BluB enzymes was further confirmed in vitro by providing the enzyme with FMNH2 and oxygen and observing the formation of DMB by HPLC. The formation of a 4a-peroxyflavin intermediate, the first step in the oxygen dependent mechanism of DMB biosynthesis, is reported here and is the first intermediate in the enzyme catalysed reaction to be demonstrated experimentally to date. The identification and characterization of an FMN-binding protein found on the cobI operon of B. megaterium, CbiY, is also detailed, revealing an FMN-containing enzyme which is able to stabilize a blue flavin semiquinone upon reduction with a 1-electron donor.
TI  - Control of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by FtsH-mediated proteolysis of LpxC is conserved in enterobacteria but not in all gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Despite the essential function of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, it is largely unknown how the exact amount of this molecule in the outer membrane is controlled. The first committed step in LPS biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LpxC enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the cellular concentration of LpxC is adjusted by the only essential protease in this organism, the membrane-anchored metalloprotease FtsH. Turnover of E. coli LpxC requires a length- and sequence-specific C-terminal degradation signal. LpxC proteins from Salmonella, Yersinia, and Vibrio species carry similar C-terminal ends and, like the E. coli enzyme, were degraded by FtsH. Although LpxC proteins are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, there are striking differences in their C termini. The Aquifex aeolicus enzyme, which is devoid of the C-terminal extension, was stable in E. coli, whereas LpxC from the alphaproteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhodobacter capsulatus was degraded by the Lon protease. Proteolysis of the A. tumefaciens protein required the C-terminal end of LpxC. High stability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxC in E. coli and P. aeruginosa suggested that Pseudomonas uses a proteolysis-independent strategy to control its LPS content. The differences in LpxC turnover along with previously reported differences in susceptibility against antimicrobial compounds have important implications for the potential of LpxC as a drug target.

TI  - Proline catabolism by Pseudomonas putida: cloning, characterization, and expression of the put genes in the presence of root exudates.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2442 is a root-colonizing strain which can use proline, one  of the major components in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn5-Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to 'lacZ. The induction ratio for the putA promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the putP promoter.
TI  - Anaerobic protoporphyrin biosynthesis does not require incorporation of methyl groups from methionine.
AB  - It was recently reported (H. Akutsu, J.-S. Park, and S. Sano, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115:12185-12186, 1993) that in the strict anaerobe Desulfovibrio vulgaris methyl groups from exogenous L-methionine are incorporated specifically into the 1 and 3 positions (Fischer numbering system) on the heme groups of cytochrome c3. It was suggested that under anaerobic conditions, protoporphyrin IX biosynthesis proceeds via a novel pathway that does not involve coproporphyrinogen III as a precursor but instead may use precorrin-2 (1,3-dimethyluroporphyrinogen III), a siroheme and vitamin B12 precursor which is known to be derived from uroporphyrinogen III via methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine. We have critically tested this hypothesis by examining the production of protoporphyrin IX-based tetrapyrroles in the presence of exogenous [14C]methyl-L-methionine under anaerobic conditions in a strict anaerobe (Chlorobium vibrioforme) and a facultative anaerobe (Rhodobacter capsulatus). In both organisms, 14C was incorporated into the bacteriochlorophyll precursor, Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester. However, most of the label was lost upon base hydrolysis of this compound to yield Mg-protoporphyrin IX. These results indicate that although the administered [14C]methyl-L-methionine was taken up, converted into S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and used for methyl transfer reactions, including methylation of the 6-propionate of Mg-protoporphyrin IX, methyl groups were not transferred to the porphyrin nucleus of Mg-protoporphyrin IX. In other experiments, a cysG strain of Salmonella typhimurium, which cannot synthesize precorrin-2 because the gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes methylation of uroporphyrinogen III at positions 1 and 3 is disrupted, was capable of heme-dependent anaerobic nitrate respiration and growth on the nonfermentable substrate glycerol, indicating that anaerobic biosynthesis of protoporphyrin IX-based hemes does not require the ability to methylate uroporphyrinogen III. Together, these results indicate that incorporation of L-methionine-deprived methyl groups into porphyrins or their precursors is not generally necessary for the anaerobic biosynthesis of protoporphyrin IX-based tetrapyrroles.
TI  - Identification and sequence analysis of genes involved in late steps in cobalamin (vitamin B12) synthesis in Rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  - A 6.4-kb region of a 6.8-kb BamHI fragment carrying Rhodobacter capsulatus genes  involved in late steps of cobalamin synthesis has been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence and genetic analysis revealed that this fragment contains eight genes arranged in at least three operons. Five of these eight genes show homology to genes involved in the cobalamin synthesis of Pseudomonas denitrificans and Salmonella typhimurium. The arrangement of these homologous genes differs considerably in the three genera. Upstream of five overlapping genes (named bluFEDCB), a promoter activity could be detected by using lacZ fusions. This promoter shows no regulation by oxygen, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), or cobinamide. Disruption of the bluE gene by a Tn5 insertion (strain AH2) results in reduced expression of the puf and puc operons, which encode pigment-binding proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus. The mutant strain AH2 can be corrected to a wild-type-like phenotype by addition of vitamin B12 or cobinamide dicyanide. Disruption of the bluB gene by an interposon (strain BB1) also disturbs the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus. The mutation of strain BB1 can be corrected by vitamin B12 but not by cobinamide. We propose that a lack of cobalamin results in deregulation and a decreased formation of the photosynthetic apparatus.
TI  - Cloning and sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium hemL gene and identification of the missing enzyme in hemL mutants as glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium forms the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) exclusively from glutamate via the five-carbon pathway, which also occurs in plants and some bacteria including Escherichia coli, rather than by ALA synthase-catalyzed condensation of glycine and succinyl-coenzyme A, which occurs in yeasts, fungi, animal cells, and some bacteria including Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Rhodobacter capsulatus. ALA-auxotrophic hemL mutant S. typhimurium cells are deficient in glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) aminotransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of ALA synthesis via the five-carbon pathway. hemL cells transformed with a plasmid containing the S. typhimurium hemL gene did not require ALA for growth and had GSA aminotransferase activity. Growth in the presence of ALA did not appreciably affect the level of extractable GSA aminotransferase activity in wild-type cells or in hemL cells transformed with the hemL plasmid. These results indicate that GSA aminotransferase activity is required for in vivo ALA biosynthesis from glutamate. In contrast, extracts of both wild-type and hemL cells had gamma,delta-dioxovalerate aminotransferase activity, which indicates that this reaction is not catalyzed by GSA aminotransferase and that the enzyme is not encoded by the hemL gene. The S. typhimurium hemL gene was sequenced and determined to contain an open reading frame of 426 codons encoding a 45.3-kDa polypeptide. The sequence of the hemL gene bears no recognizable similarity to the hemA gene of S. typhimurium or E. coli, which encodes glutamyl-tRNA reductase, or to the hemA genes of B. japonicum or R. capsulatus, which encode ALA synthase. The predicted hemL gene product does show greater than 50% identity to barley GSA aminotransferase over its entire length. Sequence similarity to other aminotransferases was also detected.
TI  - Structure and evolution of a multidomain multiphosphoryl transfer protein. Nucleotide sequence of the fruB(HI) gene in Rhodobacter capsulatus and comparisons with homologous genes from other organisms.
AB  - The gene order of the fructose (fru) operon and nucleotide sequence of the first  gene (fruB(HI) of Rhodobacter capsulatus are reported, analyzed and compared with homologous genes from other bacteria, and the gene products are identified. Included within the region reported is a gene encoding a multiphosphoryl transfer protein (MTP) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). MTP consists of three moieties: a fructose-specific enzyme III (IIIfru)-like N-terminal moiety (residues 1 to 143) followed by an FPr(HPr)-like moiety (residues 157 to 245) and an enzyme I-like moiety (residues 273 to 827). The enzyme III-like moiety closely resembles the N-terminal 143 residues of the IIIfru-FPR fusion protein from Salmonella typhimurium (40.6% identity throughout its length) and the C-terminal 145 residues of the mannitol-specific enzyme II (IImtl) (37.8% identity throughout its length with the IIImtl moiety of IImtl). The FPr-like domain of MTP resembles the S. typhimurium FPr (42.4% identity) and the Escherichia coli or S. typhimurium HPr (38.8% identity). The enzyme I-like moiety resembles the E. coli enzyme I (38.9% identity). Predicted phosphorylation sites within the three functional units of MTP (His62 in the IIIfru-like moiety; His171 in the FPr-like moiety and His457 in the enzyme I-like moiety) were identified on the basis of sequence comparisons with the homologous proteins from enteric bacteria. The three functional domains of MTP are joined by two flexible "linkage" regions, rich in alanine, glycine and proline, which show 47% sequence identity with each other. They also exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the linkage region of the mannose-specific enzyme III (IIIman) of the E. coli PTS as well as several other proteins of bacterial, eukaryotic and viral origin. At the RNA level, these linker regions formed hairpin structures with high (90%) G + C content. Analyses of the IIIfru-FPr fusion protein of S. typhimurium revealed that between the IIIfru and FPr moieties of this protein is a stretch of 142 amino acids that do not show homology to known PTS proteins. This region and the adjacent FPr-like region contain a sequence of 110 residues exhibiting 59% similarity to the receiver consensus motif defined by Kofoid and Parkinson. Because the Salmonella IIIfru-FPr fusion protein has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, this region of the Salmonella protein may prove to have regulatory significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
