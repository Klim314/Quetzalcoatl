TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in north lebanon.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. this study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of lebanon, between september  2012 and january 2013. from these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. the use of genotypic rep-pcr fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens:  gardnerella vaginalis cip7074t, staphylococcus aureus atcc33862, escherichia coli cip103982, and candida albicans atcc10231. the antagonistic lactobacilli strains  were then identified using 16s rdna sequence. the data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid dna, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.

TI  == [vaginal infections in pregnant women at the regional hospital of sokode (togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the regional hospital of sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. materials and methods: this prospective study took place from june 2010 through august 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. results: we isolated 273 germs, alone or  in association in 221 women. these germs were distributed as follows: gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), candida spp (30.77%), staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and mobiluncus spp (0.37%). no streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. the occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (p = 0.05). the susceptibility tests revealed that s. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while enterobacteriaceae  was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). conclusion: this study  showed that pregnant women in sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by g. vaginalis and candida species. these results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == pregnancy-induced changes in immune protection of the genital tract: defining normal.
AB  == objective: both the state of pregnancy as well as disruption of vaginal flora and immune mediators may increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-1 acquisition. the objective of this study was to define immune changes in lower genital and systemic immunity associated with normal pregnancy. study design: this prospective cohort enrolled low-risk pregnant and nonpregnant women ages 18-35 years. pregnant women at <14 weeks and nonpregnant women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were included. cervical and vaginal fluid was collected. concentrations of immune mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods or multiplex immunoassay. samples were inoculated onto various culture media allowing for growth of lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, enterococcus species, anaerobic gram-negative rods, candida, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma species, and mycoplasma hominis. concentrations of immune mediators and vaginal colonization frequencies were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. results: genital tract concentration of interleukin-1beta was higher during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant participants. serum c-reactive protein concentrations were higher in all trimesters of pregnancy. concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor did not differ between groups. lactobacillus was more commonly isolated from vaginal cultures of nonpregnant participants (100% vs 70.2%, p = .02). identification of candida, g vaginalis, m hominis, and s aureus was common  and not different between groups. ureaplasma species was isolated from >60% pregnant participants. conclusion: the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, as well as the systemic marker of inflammation, c-reactive protein, are increased during pregnancy. the impact of these proinflammatory changes during pregnancy deserves further study.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == chronic vulvitis in pre-pubertal girls.
AB  == pre-pubertal girls with inflammatory chronic vulval disease excluding lichen sclerosus are often described as having 'non-specific vulvovaginitis'. the aim of this retrospective case series was to determine the aetiology of chronic vulvovaginitis in pre-pubertal (tanner stage 1) girls, with particular reference  to candidiasis. a chart review recorded and compared the characteristics of 38 girls and 68 post-menarchal adolescents and pre-menopausal women with chronic vulvitis. nineteen (50%) of the pre-pubertal children had been previously diagnosed with candidiasis and 21 (55%) had been treated unsuccessfully with topical antifungal agents. candida albicans was isolated in two (5%) of the children and 37 (54%) of the adults (p < 0.001). a positive candida culture was causally associated with chronic vulvovaginitis in 50% of the adults but in none  of the children (p < 0.001). in 28 (74%) of the children and 28 (41%) of the adults, no pathogens were isolated on microbiological testing. general skin examination of the girls revealed signs of psoriasis in 27 (71%) and atopic dermatitis in nine (24%). symptoms were controlled with topical anti-inflammatory treatment and environmental modification, including cessation of topical antifungals. pre-pubertal girls with chronic vulvitis are likely to have either psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis is not seen in tanner stage 1 girls.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

AB  == a prospective case control study that was conducted at the university of ilorin teaching hospital, ilorin, nigeria, between 1st january and 31st december 2002. the purpose of this study was to determine the association and the pattern of bacteria/microorganisms in the aetiology of pre-labour premature rupture of membrane (prom) in this centre. a total of 108 cases of prom and 98 control cases that presented between 37 completed weeks' and 40 weeks' gestation were analysed. pathogens were isolated in 48 patients, giving a recovery rate of 44.4%. the common pathogens include gardnerella vaginalis (29.1%), candida (23.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (18.7%). others were streps. pyogenes (16.6%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (6.3%) and klebsiella (6.3%). only candida and s.  aureus were isolated in the controls. ofloxacin and azithromycin were 100% active against all the isolated pathogens, while ampicillin was the least active. g. vaginalis was the most sensitive among the isolates while cons and klebsiella were the least sensitive. it is evident in this study that some pathogens were associated with prom and that g. vaginalis was the most common organism and azithromycin was the only antibiotic with 100% sensitivity. we suggest that metronidazole should be added to azithromycin to cover for anaerobes in cases of  prom, where facilities for screening for anaerobes are not available.

TI  == normal ocular flora in newborns delivered in two hospital centers in argentina and paraguay.
AB  == purpose: to determine the spectrum of normal conjunctival flora in newborns in two hospital centers in north argentina and paraguay. methods: in this prospective observational study, conjunctival specimens were obtained from the right eyes of newborns prior to the application of any topical medications. culture samples were also obtained from the cervicovaginal secretions of the infants' mothers. all samples were directly inoculated into culture media and all growth were identified and quantified. results: among the 190 newborns studied, 126 were delivered vaginally and 64 via caesarean section (c-section). a total of 180 different bacterial strains were acquired from the vaginally delivered infants and 77 from the c-section group (p=0.078, student's t-test). conjunctival cultures obtained within one hour of birth showed that 85 out of 101 samples (84%) from both the vaginal and c-section group had positive cultures, compared to 84 out of 89 samples (94%) obtained more than 1 h after birth (p<0.001). among the vaginally delivered newborns, the most common bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (in 69 samples, 38%), propionibacterium spp (36, 20%) and corynebacterium spp (29, 16%). in the ces, the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (39, 51%), propionibacterium spp (22, 29%) and staphylococcus aureus (6, 8%). there was a significantly higher proportion of gram-positive rods (p=0.017) isolated from infants delivered vaginally (16%) than from those delivered by c-section (5%). no neisseria gonorrhoeae were isolated in conjunctival samples. among the 130 organisms isolated from cervicovaginal secretions in 81 out of 189 mothers, the most common organisms were lactobacillus spp. (47%), corynebacterium spp (21%), gardnerella vaginalis (15%), and candida spp (14%). no neisseria gonorrhoeae or chlamydia trachomatis were found in cervicovaginal samples. conclusion: the most common conjunctival bacteria in newborns delivered by either vaginal birth or c-section were coagulase-negative staphylococcus. the proportion of positive conjunctival cultures was higher for infants delivered vaginally than for c-section delivery.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == [bacterial flora in the genital tract the last trimester of pregnancy].
AB  == very widespread in our clinical setting, early-onset sepsis is due to organisms that commonly colonize or infect the maternal genital tract; identifying such organisms would help improve prevention and treatment. objective: to determine the bacterial ecology and the pathological status of the genital organs during the last trimester of pregnancy, in order to evaluate the risk of materno-fetal infections and to improve the present prophylactic measures based on monitoring bacterial carriage during the first trimester. method: vaginal and endocervical samples, usually taken during the first trimester of pregnancy were delayed and taken during the last trimester of pregnancy, in patients with no signs of sepsis and not taking antibiotics. a macroscopic examination described the aspect of the vagina, the cervix uteri, leukorrhea and possible inflammatory lesions or ulcerations. a microscopic examination searched for parasites, epithelial cells,  clue cells and leukocytes. the appropriate bacteriological cultures were performed after reading the gram stain and scoring the vaginal flora. the clinical and cytobacteriological aspects were used to identify the bacterial ecology and the pathological genital states. results: genital samples were collected from 306 pregnant women. among them 118 were at 29-32 weeks of gestation, 104 at 33-36 and 84 at 37-40. the most frequent germs were c. albicans (33.3%), enterobacteriaceae (20.3%) including e. coli (10.9%), s. aureus (15.4%), gardnerella (13.6%), and trichomonas (10.6%), in monomicrobian (79.2%) or polymicrobian carriage (20.8%). lower genital tract pathological states such as vaginitis (29.4%), bacterial vaginosis (21.5%) or cervicitis (10.4%) and asymptomatic bacterial carriage (23.5%) and normal genital flora (15%) were identified. conclusion: this is the first report of genital bacterial carriage in african women during the last trimester of pregnancy. larger studies are required to evaluate the risk of maternofetal infections and to improve current prophylaxis measures.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == detection of cervical immunoglobulin a in normal pregnancy.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each  woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55  (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora  showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those  with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == interrelationships within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  == analysis of 240 consecutive vaginal swabs using the compatibility profile technique revealed that only 2 bacteria have the ability to be a sole isolate and as such a candidate to be a major aerobic regulator of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract (bffgt). compatibility profiles of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis have shown that these organisms shared compatibility profiling for the majority of the normal bacterial constituents of the female genital tract. dominance disruption appears to come from the addition of compatible co-isolates and presumed loss of numerical superiority. these phenomena appear to be the keys to reregulation of bffgt. lactobacillus appears to be the major regulator of both g. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria. when additional organisms are added to the bacterial flora, they may add to or partially negate the inhibitory influence of lactobacillus on the bffgt. inhibitor interrelationships appear to exist between coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus and the group b streptococci (gbs) and other beta hemolytic streptococci. facilitating interrelationships appear to exist between s. aureus and the gbs and selected enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro ability of the group b streptococci to inhibit gram-positive and gram-variable constituents of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of septicemic and nonsepticemic isolates of group b streptococci (gbs) to inhibit in vitro the principal bacterial groups found in the normal bacterial flora of the female genital tract. methods: the target groups were composed of 1) 10 strains each of  the following: viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci (not group b or d), group a streptococci, gbs, peptostreptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, and gardnerella vaginalis; 2) 9 strains of  enterococci; 3) 9 strains of group c or g streptococci; 4) 7 strains of lactobacilli; and 5) 7 strains of diphtheroids. all target groups were tested for inhibition by a test panel of either a group of 10 or 41 gbs isolates. if the gbs isolates failed to inhibit a target group, that group was tested for its ability  to inhibit the gbs test panel. results: the gbs test panel did not inhibit the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci or s. aureus but uniformly inhibited groups a, b, c, and g streptococci, lactobacilli, and g. vaginalis. one of the 7  strains of diphtheroids was inhibited by 37 of the 41 gbs isolates; the other 6 strains of diphtheroids were uniformly inhibited. variable inhibition by gbs was  observed with viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic (not group b or d) streptococci, peptostreptococci, and enterococci; however, inhibition or noninhibition was uniform for a given target strain against the entire gbs test panel. the 23 gbs isolates obtained from septicemic neonates or adults did not differ from the 18 nonsepticemic isolates in their ability to inhibit other species of streptococci or other gram-positive or gram-variable constituents of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. when converse testing was done,  all 10 gbs isolates were uniformly inhibited by coagulase-negative staphylococci  and by the majority of enterococci, but were not inhibited by s. aureus. conclusions: these studies suggest that gbs may be significant regulators of other beta-hemolytic streptococci, diphtheroids, lactobacilli, and g. vaginalis within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. moreover, the absence of  gbs in the vaginal flora may be the result of mediation by coagulase-negative staphylococci and selected strains of enterococci.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

AB  == in this study the lea's shield was evaluated for its tolerance by women who wore  the device for three consecutive days. ten women who wore the lea's shield for 72 hours completed the tolerance study without adverse effects. examination of the cervix and vagina revealed that the device did not provoke any significant cellular or microbial changes among the wearers. no major changes in the appearance or prevalence of vaginal flora occurred in the women after three days  of wearing the device. a gradient in the ph could be detected between the contents of the vagina, which was more acidic than the contents of the bowl of the device. the range of cervical shapes and vaginal morphology among the study participants has had no influence upon the ability of the device to remain in its proper position. the device "settles in place" as it is pushed in, thereby obviating any special maneuvers for proper positioning. no vaginal nor cervical trauma occurred. we have concluded from these basic clinical evaluations that lea's shield is well tolerated during three days of use. efficacy trials in women at risk recently completed have confirmed the high degree of acceptability and that the device can function adequately as one size fits all.

AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

(s. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, mic90, 1.0 mg/l; methicillin-resistant, mic90 1.0  mg/l; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, mic90 0.5 mg/l). lancefield group a, b, c and g streptococci (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) appeared to be susceptible to rp 59500. some streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of rp 59500 (enterococci: mic90 4 mg/l, range 0.125-16 mg/l). comparatively low mics were seen when legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and gardnerella vaginalis were tested. broth dilution mic/mbc determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as mic values were within two dilutions of mbc values. rp 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.

AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == microbiology of specialized skin: the vulva.
AB  == human vulvar skin is an example of specialized skin. this is not only true for its gross and microscopic anatomy and physiology, but also for its microbiology.  to the microbiologist, the vulva consists of several distinct ecotopes. these are defined by the physical factors, especially occlusion, nutrient factors, and by the close proximity to the vagina, the urethra, and the anus, which may result in contamination with the flora typical for those sites. of the vulva ecotopes, only the labia majora have been seriously studied. the microbial flora of the labia majora is characterized by a high density of microorganisms, as is typical for occluded areas of the body, by the presence of organisms common for intertriginous skin such as gram-negative rods, and by the carriage of organisms  unique for the vulva and probably related to urethral and vaginal flora such as the nonpathogenic neisseria, lactobacilli, and gardnerella vaginalis. finally, the labia majora skin is a preferred site of staphylococcus aureus carriage that  can be of clinical and epidemiological relevance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  == vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is candida albicans. in a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. in a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. the organisms cultured were: candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), streptococcus milleri (n = 1), streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). where a bacterial organism was  isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. it is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole  against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (bv) or skin infections by agar dilution mic determinations. bv-associated bacteroides isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus-b. oralis group, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but bacteroides spp. not associated with bv, bacteroides ureolyticus and the bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. all bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of g. vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. varied. among the skin bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. this antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == on a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. inhibition zones were observed in the growth of  all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. the inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. four bacteroides fragilis strains as well  as 2 out of 4 staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. the inhibition zones were generally wider at ph 5.5 than at 6.0. for all inhibited strains, (the s. aureus excepted) a low ph on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.

AB  == transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. a protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (p less than .001). among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group b streptococcus, enterococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery  from the endometrium. protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == isolation of gardnerella vaginalis from high vaginal swabs.
AB  == vaginal swabs from 2715 consecutive unselected women with vaginal discharge were  examined for gardnerella vaginalis, candida albicans and trichomonas vaginalis. of 2715 women, 2043 had non-specific vaginitis and g. vaginalis was isolated from 269 cases (13.2%). thirty five of the strains were isolated together with c. albicans, eight with t. vaginalis, six with bacteroides species and three each with group b streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus. two hundred and sixteen (80%) of the isolates were from females between the age of 20 and 34. all 269 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch; 161 (60%) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. although facts suggest that vaginal discharge in most of these cases had been associated with g. vaginalis, a possible aetiological role for other micro-organisms has not been ruled out. however, successful therapy with metronidazole in 80% of those cases suggests that g. vaginalis is one cause of non-specific vaginitis. the prevalence rate of g. vaginalis in 160 randomly selected women without vaginal discharge was 5%.

AB  == in 76 women with non-specific vaginitis we could always isolate gardnerella vaginalis and several anaerobics, especially bacteroides species, in hgh counts.  in 19 puerperae, bacteriologial examinations of the infected episiotomy wound yielded a spectrum of pathogens similar to that of non-specific vaginitis. in 74  per cent of the women with wound infection following episiotomy, non-specific vaginitis had either already been present before childbirth (and identified as gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis), or was confirmed at the time of infection. staphylococcus aureus was seen in 16 per cent of the wound infections, whereas other pathogens were identified in 10 per cent. in a prospective study on vaginal flora ante partum and rate of infection post partum, based on 405 vaginal deliveries, 80% of the examined pregnant women had a normal vaginal flora with lactobacilli. in 12%, we found gardnerella vaginalis, and in 8% a mixed flora. since the rate of infection in women with gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis and episiotomy was found to be ten times higher than that in women with doderlein's flora and episiotomy, it is obvious that gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis is not just an aesthetic problem.
