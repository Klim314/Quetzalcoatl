TI  == characterization of the ability to form biofilms by plant-associated pseudomonas  species.
AB  == successful colonization is the initial step for plant-bacteria interactions; therefore, the development of strategies to improve adherence to plant surfaces is critically important for environmental bacteria. biofilm formation is thought  to be one such strategy for bacteria to establish stable colonization on inert and living surfaces. although biofilms play potential roles in enabling persistent bacterial colonization, little attention has been paid to biofilms formed by plant-associated bacteria. in this study, we characterized the biofilm-forming ability of 6 species of bacteria from the family pseudomonadaceae: pseudomonas protegens, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas mendocina, and pseudomonas syringae. these strains exhibit different degrees of biofilm formation depending on incubation time and nutrient availability. distinct preferences for growth media  were observed, as biofilms were formed by p. protegens with rich nutrients and by p. fluorescens and p. putida with poor nutrients. likewise, p. stutzeri did not form biofilms with rich nutrients but did form biofilms under nutrient-poor conditions. these observations indicate that particular components in media may influence biofilm formation. p. putida, one of the strains with high biofilm-forming ability, showed the highest ability for initial attachment, which may be mediated by the hydrophobicity of its cell surface. p. mendocina also has  high ability for initial attachment, and this strain produces cell surface-attached extracellular polysaccharides that promote cell aggregation. thus, each strain possesses different properties that facilitate biofilm formation. shedding light on bacterial strategies for colonization via biofilm formation would enable a better understanding of plant-bacteria interactions.

TI  == diversity of small rnas expressed in pseudomonas species.
AB  == rna sequencing (rna-seq) has revealed several hundreds of previously undetected small rnas (srnas) in all bacterial species investigated, including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas syringae. nonetheless, only little is known about the extent of conservation of expressed srnas across strains and species. in this study, we have used rna-seq to identify srnas in p.  putida dot-t1e and pseudomonas extremaustralis 14-3b. this is the first strain of p. extremaustralis and the second strain of p. putida to have their transcriptomes analysed for srnas, and we identify the presence of around 150 novel srnas in each strain. furthermore, we provide a comparison based on sequence conservation of all the srnas detected by rna-seq in the pseudomonas species investigated so far. our results show that the extent of srna conservation across different species is very limited. in addition, when comparing the srnas expressed in different strains of the same species, we observe that numerous srnas exhibit a strain-specific expression pattern. these results support the idea that the evolution of most bacterial srnas is rapid, which limits the extent of both interspecies and intraspecies conservation.

TI  == the c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase bifa is involved in the virulence of bacteria from the pseudomonas syringae complex.
AB  == in a recent screen for novel virulence factors involved in the interaction between pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and the olive tree, a mutant was selected that contained a transposon insertion in a putative cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) phosphodiesterase-encoding gene. this gene displayed high similarity to bifa of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. here, we examined the role of bifa in free-living and virulence-related phenotypes of two bacterial plant pathogens in the pseudomonas syringae complex, the tumour-inducing pathogen of woody hosts, p. savastanoi pv. savastanoi ncppb 3335, and the pathogen of tomato and arabidopsis, p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. we showed that deletion of the bifa gene resulted in decreased swimming motility of both bacteria and inhibited swarming motility of dc3000. in contrast, overexpression of bifa in p.  savastanoi pv. savastanoi had a positive impact on swimming motility and negatively affected biofilm formation. deletion of bifa in ncppb 3335 and dc3000  resulted in reduced fitness and virulence of the microbes in olive (ncppb 3335) and tomato (dc3000) plants. in addition, real-time monitoring of olive plants infected with green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged p. savastanoi cells displayed an altered spatial distribution of mutant deltabifa cells inside olive  knots compared with the wild-type strain. all free-living phenotypes that were altered in both deltabifa mutants, as well as the virulence of the ncppb 3335 deltabifa mutant in olive plants, were fully rescued by complementation with p. aeruginosa bifa, whose phosphodiesterase activity has been demonstrated. thus, these results suggest that p. syringae and p. savastanoi bifa are also active phosphodiesterases. this first demonstration of the involvement of a putative phosphodiesterase in the virulence of the p. syringae complex provides confirmation of the role of c-di-gmp signalling in the virulence of this group of plant pathogens.

TI  == draft genome sequence analysis of a pseudomonas putida w15oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to gram-positive and pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. p. putida w15oct28, isolated from a stream in brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for p. putida. the active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against p. aeruginosa. analysis of the draft genome  confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. one cluster  of ten genes was detected, comprising a nad-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl coa dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a rnd efflux pump. p.  putida w15oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding tonb-dependent receptors,  conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. one unique feature of w15oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type iv secretion, and several genes for type vi secretion and their vgrg effectors.

TI  == pyoverdine synthesis by the mn(ii)-oxidizing bacterium pseudomonas putida gb-1.
AB  == when iron-starved, the mn(ii)-oxidizing bacteria pseudomonas putida strains gb-1  and mnb1 produce pyoverdines (pvdgb-1 and pvdmnb1), siderophores that both influence iron uptake and inhibit manganese(ii) oxidation by these strains. to explore the properties and genetics of a pvd that can affect manganese oxidation, lc-ms/ms, and various siderotyping techniques were used to identify the peptides  of pvdgb-1 and pvdmnb1 as being (for both pvds): chromophore-asp-lys-ohasp-ser-gly-athr-lys-cohorn, resembling a structure previously reported for p. putida cfml 90-51, which does not oxidize mn. all three strains also produced an azotobactin and a sulfonated pvd, each with the peptide sequence above, but with unknown regulatory or metabolic effects. bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced genome of p. putida gb-1 suggested that a particular non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps), coded by the operon pputgb1_4083-4086, could produce the peptide backbone of pvdgb-1. to verify this  prediction, plasmid integration disruption of pputgb1_4083 was performed and the  resulting mutant failed to produce detectable pvd. in silico analysis of the modules in pputgb1_4083-4086 predicted a peptide sequence of asp-lys-asp-ser-ala-thr-lsy-orn, which closely matches the peptide determined by  ms/ms. to extend these studies to other organisms, various mn(ii)-oxidizing and non-oxidizing isolates of p. putida, p. fluorescens, p. marincola, p. fluorescens-syringae group, p. mendocina-resinovorans group, and p. stutzerii group were screened for pvd synthesis. the pvd producers (12 out of 16 tested strains) were siderotyped and placed into four sets of differing pvd structures,  some corresponding to previously characterized pvds and some to novel pvds. these results combined with previous studies suggested that the presence of ohasp or the flexibility of the pyoverdine polypeptide may enable efficient binding of mn(iii).

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of bacteriophages infecting pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, causal agent of kiwifruit bacterial canker.
AB  == the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (psa) is the causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit. in the last years, it has caused severe economic losses to actinidia spp. cultivations, mainly in italy and new zealand.  conventional strategies adopted did not provide adequate control of infection. phage therapy may be a realistic and safe answer to the urgent need for novel antibacterial agents aiming to control this bacterial pathogen. in this study, we described the isolation and characterization of two bacteriophages able to specifically infect psa. phipsa1, a member of the siphoviridae family, is a temperate phage with a narrow host range, a long latency, and a burst size of 178; phipsa2 is a lytic phage of podoviridae family with a broader host range, a  short latency, a burst size of 92 and a higher bactericidal activity as determined by the tod value. the genomic sequence of phipsa1 has a length of 51,090 bp and a low sequence homology with the other siphophages, whereas phipsa2 has a length of 40 472 bp with a 98% homology with pseudomonas putida bacteriophage gh-1. of the two phages examined, phipsa2 may be considered as a candidate for phage therapy of kiwifruit disease, while phipsa1 seems specific toward the recent outbreak's isolates and could be useful for psa typing.

TI  == analysis of the draft genome of pseudomonas fluorescens atcc17400 indicates a capacity to take up iron from a wide range of sources, including different exogenous pyoverdines.
AB  == all fluorescent pseudomonads (pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens,  p. syringae and others) are known to produce the high-affinity peptidic yellow-green fluorescent siderophore pyoverdine. these siderophores have peptide  chains that are quite diverse and more than 50 pyoverdine structures have been elucidated. in the majority of the cases, a pseudomonas species is also able to produce a second siderophore of lower affinity for iron. pseudomonas fluorescens  atcc 17400 has been shown to produce a unique second siderophore, (thio)quinolobactin, which has an antimicrobial activity against the phytopathogenic oomycete pythium debaryanum. we show that this strain has the capacity to utilize 16 different pyoverdines, suggesting the presence of several  ferripyoverdine receptors. analysis of the draft genome of p. fluorescens atcc 17400 confirmed the presence of 55 tonb-dependent receptors, the largest so far for pseudomonas, among which 15 are predicted to be ferripyoverdine receptors (fpv). phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two different clades containing ferripyoverdine receptors, with sequences similar to the p. aeruginosa type ii fpva forming a separate cluster. among the other receptors we confirmed the presence of the qbsi (thio)quinolobactin receptor, an ferri-achromobactin and an ornicorrugatin receptor, several catecholate and four putative heme receptors. twenty five of the receptors genes were found to be associated with genes encoding extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ecf sigma) and transmembrane anti-sigma  sensors.

TI  == development of genomic tools for the identification of certain pseudomonas up to  species level.
AB  == pseudomonas is a highly versatile bacterium at the species level with great ecological significance. these genetically and metabolically diverse species have undergone repeated taxonomic revisions. we propose a strategy to identify pseudomonas up to species level, based on the unique features of their 16s rdna (rrs) gene sequence, such as the frame work of sequences, sequence motifs and restriction endonuclease (re) digestion patterns. a species specific phylogenetic framework composed of 31 different rrs sequences, allowed us to segregate 1,367 out of 2,985 rrs sequences of this genus, which have been classified at present only up to genus (pseudomonas) level, as follows: p. aeruginosa (219 sequences),  p. fluorescens (463 sequences), p. putida (347 sequences), p. stutzeri (197 sequences), and p. syringae (141 sequences). these segregations were validated by unique 30-50 nucleotide long motifs and re digestion patterns in their rrs. a single gene thus provides multiple makers for identification and surveillance of  pseudomonas.

TI  == measurement of ice nucleation-active bacteria on plants and in precipitation by quantitative pcr.
AB  == ice nucleation-active (ina) bacteria may function as high-temperature ice-nucleating particles (inp) in clouds, but their effective contribution to atmospheric processes, i.e., their potential to trigger glaciation and precipitation, remains uncertain. we know little about their abundance on natural vegetation, factors that trigger their release, or persistence of their ice nucleation activity once airborne. to facilitate these investigations, we developed two quantitative pcr (qpcr) tests of the ina gene to directly count ina bacteria in environmental samples. each of two primer pairs amplified most alleles of the ina gene and, taken together, they should amplify all known alleles. to aid primer design, we collected many new ina isolates. alignment of their partial ina sequences revealed new and deeply branching clades, including sequences from pseudomonas syringae pv. atropurpurea, ps. viridiflava, pantoea agglomerans, xanthomonas campestris, and possibly ps. putida, ps. auricularis, and ps. poae. qpcr of leaf washings recorded approximately 10(8) ina genes g(-1)  fresh weight of foliage on cereals and 10(5) to 10(7) g(-1) on broadleaf crops. much lower populations were found on most naturally occurring vegetation. in fresh snow, ina genes from various ina bacteria were detected in about half the samples but at abundances that could have accounted for only a minor proportion of inp at -10 degrees c (assuming one ina gene per ina bacterium). despite this,  an apparent biological source contributed an average of approximately 85% of inp  active at -10 degrees c in snow samples. in contrast, a thunderstorm hail sample  contained 0.3 ina bacteria per inp active at -10 degrees c, suggesting a significant contribution to this sample.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of the self-transmissible tol plasmid pd2rt provides new insight into arrangement of toluene catabolic plasmids.
AB  == in the present study we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the toluene catabolic plasmid pd2rt of pseudomonas migulae strain d2rt isolated from baltic sea water. the pd2rt is 129,894 base pairs in size with an average g+c content of 53.75%. a total of 135 open reading frames (orfs) were predicted to encode proteins, among them genes for catabolism of toluene, plasmid replication, maintenance and conjugative transfer. orfs encoding proteins with putative functions in stress response, transposition and site-specific recombination were  also predicted. analysis of the organization and nucleotide sequence of pd2rt backbone region revealed high degree of similarity to the draft genome sequence data of the plant-pathogenic pseudomonad pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea strain b076, exhibiting relatedness to ppt23a plasmid family. the pd2rt backbone is also closely related to that of pgrt1 of pseudomonas putida strain dot-t1e and pbvie04 of burkholderia vietnamiensis strain g4, both plasmids are associated with resistance to toluene. the ability of pd2rt to self-transfer by conjugation to p. putida recipient strain paw340 was experimentally determined. genetic organization of toluene-degrading (xyl) genes and flanking dna segments resembles the structure of tn1721-related class ii transposon tn4656 of tol plasmid pww53 of p. putida strain mt53. the complete sequence of the plasmid pd2rt extends the  known range of xyl genes carriers, being the first completely sequenced tol plasmid, which is not related to well-studied incp plasmid groups. we also verified the functionality of the catabolic route encoded by pd2rt by monitoring  the expression of the xyle gene in pd2rt bearing hosts along with bacterial strains containing tol plasmid of incp-9 group. the growth kinetics of plasmid-bearing strains was found to be affected by particular tol plasmid.

TI  == biodegradation of low density polythene (ldpe) by pseudomonas species.
AB  == low density polythene (ldpe) is the most widely used packaging material primarily because of its excellent mechanical properties, barrier properties against water, light weight, low cost and high energy effectiveness. however, due to its ubiquitous nature, and resistance to biodegradability, the disposal strategies are crucial and need attention. recently, microorganisms have become the focus of interest for environmental friendly disposal of plastic and polymer-based waste.  this manuscript aims to investigate the extent of biodegradability of ldpe by four different strains of pseudomonas bacteria-pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 (atcc  15729), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 15692), pseudomonas putida (kt2440 atcc 47054) and pseudomonas syringae (dc3000 atcc 10862). degradation of ldpe was determined by weight loss of the sample, morphological changes, mechanical and spectroscopic variations. the eluted compounds after degradation were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. our results show that pseudomonas spp. can degrade ldpe films.

TI  == plant lectin-like antibacterial proteins from phytopathogens pseudomonas syringae and xanthomonas citri.
AB  == the genomes of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 642 and xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum lmg 761 each carry a putative homologue of the plant lectin-like bacteriocin (llpa) genes previously identified in the rhizosphere isolate pseudomonas putida bw11m1 and the biocontrol strain pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5. the respective purified recombinant proteins, llpapss642 and llpaxcm761 , display genus-specific antibacterial activity across species boundaries. the inhibitory spectrum of the p. syringae bacteriocin overlaps partially with those of the p. putida and p. fluorescens llpas. notably, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 secretes a protein identical to llpaxcm761 . the functional characterization  of llpa proteins from two different phytopathogenic gamma-proteobacterial species expands the lectin-like bacteriocin family beyond the pseudomonas genus and suggests its involvement in competition among closely related plant-associated bacteria with different lifestyles.

TI  == crosstalk between the circadian clock and innate immunity in arabidopsis.
AB  == the circadian clock integrates temporal information with environmental cues in regulating plant development and physiology. recently, the circadian clock has been shown to affect plant responses to biotic cues. to further examine this role of the circadian clock, we tested disease resistance in mutants disrupted in cca1 and lhy, which act synergistically to regulate clock activity. we found that cca1 and lhy mutants also synergistically affect basal and resistance gene-mediated defense against pseudomonas syringae and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of cca1 or lhy also resulted in severe susceptibility to p. syringae. we identified a downstream target of cca1 and lhy, grp7, a key constituent of a slave oscillator regulated by the circadian clock and previously shown to influence plant defense and stomatal activity. we show that the defense role of cca1 and lhy against p. syringae is at least partially through circadian control of stomatal aperture but is independent of defense mediated by salicylic acid. furthermore, we found defense activation by p. syringae infection and treatment with the elicitor flg22 can feedback-regulate clock activity. together this data strongly supports a direct role of the circadian clock in defense control and reveal for the first time crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.

TI  == structural determinants for activity and specificity of the bacterial toxin llpa.
AB  == lectin-like bacteriotoxic proteins, identified in several plant-associated bacteria, are able to selectively kill closely related species, including several phytopathogens, such as pseudomonas syringae and xanthomonas species, but so far  their mode of action remains unrevealed. the crystal structure of llpabw, the prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (mmbl) domains and a c-terminal beta-hairpin extension. the c-terminal mmbl domain (c-domain) adopts a fold very similar to mmbl domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site  for mannose and oligomannosides. mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. the n-terminal mmbl domain (n-domain) adopts the same fold but is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. differential activity of engineered n/c-domain chimers derived from two llpa homologues with different killing spectra, disclosed that the n-domain determines target specificity. apparently this bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity.

TI  == crcz and crcx regulate carbon source utilization in pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain dc3000.
AB  == small non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are important components of many regulatory pathways in bacteria and play key roles in regulating factors important for virulence. carbon catabolite repression control is modulated by small rnas (crcz  or crcz and crcy) in pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. in this study, we demonstrate that expression of crcz and crcx (formerly designated psr1  and psr2, respectively) is dependent upon rpon together with the two-component system cbrab, and is influenced by the carbon source present in the medium in the model plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. the distribution of the members of the crc ncrna family was also determined by screening available genomic sequences of the pseudomonads. interestingly, variable numbers of the crc family members exist in pseudomonas genomes. the ncrnas are comprised of three main subfamilies, named crcz, crcx and crcy. most importantly the crcx subfamily  appears to be unique to all p. syringae strains sequenced to date.

TI  == heterologous expression of a photorhabdus luminescens syrbactin-like gene cluster results in production of the potent proteasome inhibitor glidobactin a.
AB  == syrbactins are cyclic peptide derivatives which are known to inhibit the eukaryotic proteasome by irreversible covalent binding to its catalytic sites. the only two members of this family characterized to date, syringolin a and glidobactin a, are secreted by certain strains of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and strain k481-b101 from the order burkholderiales, respectively. syrbactins are the products of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthases encoded by gene clusters with a characteristic architecture. similar, but not identical gene clusters are present in several other bacterial genomes, including that of photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tt01, which is therefore hypothesized to be able to produce a syrbactin-type proteasome inhibitor. here we report the cloning of the putative syrbactins synthetase encoding gene cluster of ph. luminescens into a cosmid vector and its heterologous expression in pseudomonas putida. analysis of culture supernatants of transformed ps. putida by hplc and mass spectrometry revealed the presence of glidobactin a, indicating that the syrbactins-like gene cluster of ph. luminescens encodes a glidobactin a  synthetase and that this organism has the capacity to synthesize glidobactin a.

TI  == characterization of molecular mechanisms controlling fabab transcription in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: the fabab pathway is one of the unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) synthesis pathways for pseudomonas aeruginosa. it was previously noted that this  operon was upregulated in biofilms and repressed by exogenous ufas. deletion of a 30 nt faba upstream sequence, which is conserved in p. aeruginosa, p. putida, and p. syringae, led to a significant decrease in faba transcription, suggesting positive regulation by an unknown positive regulatory mechanism. methods/principal findings: here, genetic and biochemical approaches were employed to identify a potential fabab activator. deletion of candidate genes such as pa1611 or pa1627 was performed to determine if any of these gene products act as a fabab activator. however, none of these genes were involved in the regulation of fabab transcription. use of mariner-based random mutagenesis to screen for faba activator(s) showed that several genes encoding unknown functions, rpon and desa may be involved in faba regulation, but probably via indirect mechanisms. biochemical attempts performed did fail to isolate an activator of fabab operon. conclusion/significance: the data suggest that faba expression might not be regulated by protein-binding, but by a distinct mechanism such as a regulatory rna-based mechanism.

TI  == two small rnas, crcy and crcz, act in concert to sequester the crc global regulator in pseudomonas putida, modulating catabolite repression.
AB  == the crc protein is a translational repressor that recognizes a specific target at some mrnas, controlling catabolite repression and co-ordinating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the levels of free crc protein are controlled by crcz, a srna that sequesters crc, acting as an antagonist. we show  that, in pseudomonas putida, the levels of free crc are controlled by crcz and by a novel 368 nt srna named crcy. crcz and crcy, which contain six potential targets for crc, were able to bind crc specifically in vitro. the levels of crcz  and crcy were low under conditions generating a strong catabolite repression, and increased strongly when catabolite repression was absent. deletion of either crcz or crcy had no effect on catabolite repression, but the simultaneous absence of both srnas led to constitutive catabolite repression that compromised growth on some carbon sources. overproduction of crcz or crcy significantly reduced repression. we propose that crcz and crcy act in concert, sequestering and modulating the levels of free crc according to metabolic conditions. the cbra/cbrb two-component system activated crcz transcription, but had little effect on crcy. crcy was detected in p. putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas syringae, but not in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == phosphorylcholine phosphatase: a peculiar enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes phosphorylcholine phosphatase (pchp) when grown on choline, betaine, dimethylglycine or carnitine. in the presence of mg(2+) or zn(2+), pchp catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-npp) or phosphorylcholine (pcho). the regulation of pchp gene expression is under the  control of gbdr and ntrc; dimethylglycine is likely the metabolite directly involved in the induction of pchp. therefore, the regulation of choline metabolism and consequently pchp synthesis may reflect an adaptive response of p. aeruginosa to environmental conditions. bioinformatic and biochemistry studies shown that pchp contains two sites for alkylammonium compounds (aacs): one in the catalytic site near the metal ion-phosphoester pocket, and another in an inhibitory site responsible for the binding of the alkylammonium moiety. both sites could be close to each other and interact through the residues (42)e, (43)e and (82)yyy(84). zn(2+) is better activator than mg(2+) at ph 5.0 and it is more  effective at alleviating the inhibition produced by the entry of pcho or different aacs in the inhibitory site. we postulate that zn(2+) induces at ph 5.0 a conformational change in the active center that is communicated to the inhibitory site, producing a compact or closed structure. however, at ph 7.4, this effect is not observed because to the hydrolysis of the [zn(2+)l(2) (-1)l(2) (0)(h(2)o)(2)] complex, which causes a change from octahedral to tetrahedral in the metal coordination geometry. this enzyme is also present in p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. syringae, and other organisms. we have recently crystallized pchp and solved its structure.

TI  == priming by rhizobacterium protects tomato plants from biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogen infections through multiple defense mechanisms.
AB  == a selected strain of rhizobacterium, pseudomonas putida strain lsw17s (lsw17s), protects tomato plants (lycopersicon esculentum l. cv. seokwang) from bacterial speck by biotrophic pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 (dc3000) and bacterial wilt by necrotrophic ralstonia solanacearum kacc 10703 (rs10703). to investigate defense mechanisms induced by lsw17s in tomato plants, transcription  patterns of pathogenesis-related (pr) genes and h(2)o(2) production were analyzed in plants treated with lsw17s and subsequent pathogen inoculation. lsw17s alone did not induce transcriptions of employed pr genes in leaves and roots. dc3000 challenge following lsw17s triggered rapid transcriptions of pr genes and h(2)o(2) production in leaves and roots. catalase infiltration with dc3000 attenuated defense-related responses and resistance against dc3000 infection. despite depriving h(2)o(2) production and pr1b transcription by the same treatment, resistance against rs10703 infection was not deterred significantly. h(2)o(2) is indispensable for defense signaling and/or mechanisms primed by lsw17s and inhibition of bacterial speck, however, it is not involved in resistance against bacterial wilt.

TI  == a plant growth-promoting pseudomonad is closely related to the pseudomonas syringae complex of plant pathogens.
AB  == pseudomonas putida gr12-2 is well known as a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium; however, phylogenetic analysis using the 16s rrna gene and four housekeeping genes indicated that this strain forms a monophyletic group with the pseudomonas syringae complex, which is composed of several species of plant pathogens. on the basis of these sequence analyses, we suggest that p. putida gr12-2 be redesignated as p. syringae gr12-2. to compare the ecological roles of  p. syringae gr12-2 with its close relatives p. syringae pathovar (pv.) tomato dc3000 and p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, we investigated their ability to cause disease and promote plant growth. when introduced on tobacco or tomato leaves, p. syringae gr12-2 was unable to elicit a hypersensitive response or cause disease,  which are characteristic responses of p. syringae dc3000 and b728a, nor were type iii secretion system genes required for virulence detected in p. syringae gr12-2  by pcr or dna hybridization. in contrast to p. syringae gr12-2, neither of the phytopathogens was able to promote root growth when inoculated onto canola seeds. although commensals and nonpathogens have been reported among the strains of the  p. syringae complex, p. syringae gr12-2 is a mutualist and a phytostimulator.

AB  == in this study we isolated and screened drought tolerant pseudomonas isolates from arid and semi arid crop production systems of india. five isolates could tolerate osmotic stress up to -0.73 mpa and possessed multiple pgp properties such as p-solubilization, production of phytohormones (iaa, ga and cytokinin), siderophores, ammonia and hcn however under osmotic stress expression of pgp traits was low compared to non-stressed conditions. the strains were identified as pseudomonas entomophila, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae and pseudomonas monteilli respectively on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. osmotic stress affected growth pattern of all the isolates as  indicated by increased mean generation time. an increase level of intracellular free amino acids, proline, total soluble sugars and exopolysaccharides was observed under osmotic stress suggesting bacterial response to applied stress. further, strains gap-p45 and grfhytp52 showing higher levels of eps and osmolytes (amino acids and proline) accumulation under stress as compared to non-stress conditions, also exhibited higher expression of pgp traits under stress indicating a relationship between stress response and expression of pgp traits. we conclude that isolation and screening of indigenous, stress adaptable strains  possessing pgp traits can be a method for selection of efficient stress tolerant  pgpr strains.

TI  == culturable bacterial microflora associated with nectarine fruit and their potential for control of brown rot.
AB  == microflora of fruit surfaces have been the best source of antagonists against fungi causing postharvest decay of fruit. however, there is little information on microflora colonizing surfaces of fruits other than grape, apple, and citrus. we  characterized bacterial microflora on nectarine fruit surfaces from the early stage of development until harvest. identification of bacterial strains was made  using midi (fatty acid methyl ester analysis) and biolog systems. biolog identified 35% and midi 53% of the strains. thus results from midi were used to determine the frequency of occurrence of genera and species. the most frequently  occurring genera were curtobacterium (21.31%), followed by pseudomonas (19.99%),  microbacterium (13.57%), clavibacter (9.69%), pantoea (6.59%), and enterobacter (4.26%). the frequency of isolations of some bacteria - for example, the major pseudomonads (pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas savastanoi) or pantoea agglomerans - tended to decline as fruit developed. as pseudomonas declined, curtobacterium became more dominant. time of isolation was  a significant factor in the frequency of occurrence of different bacteria, indicating succession of the genera. throughput screening of the bacterial strains against monilinia fructicola on nectarine fruit resulted in the detection of strains able to control brown rot. the 10 best-performing antagonistic strains were subjected to secondary screening. four strains reduced decay severity by more than 50% (51.7%-91.4% reduction) at the high pathogen inoculum concentration of 105 conidia/ml.

TI  == the acylase pvdq has a conserved function among fluorescent pseudomonas spp.
AB  == pyoverdine biosynthesis in fluorescent pseudomonas spp. and especially in the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa has been extensively studied. the acylase pvdq is required for a maturation step in pyoverdine biosynthesis but also has been proven to be effective in degrading long-chain n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls). these molecules are used as quorum-sensing molecules by gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonads themselves. interestingly, the pvdq gene is part of a pyoverdine cluster in p. aeruginosa and p. syringae but not in  other fluorescent pseudomonas spp. in this study we have compared the activities  of pvdq orthologues from various species and provide evidence for conserved functions in pseudomonas fluorescens pfo-1, p. putida kt2440 and p. aeruginosa pa14. despite large differences in genomic organization, expression of each of these pvdq orthologues is regulated by iron availability. moreover, pvdq and its  orthologues have conserved substrate specificity for ahls and play a role in pyoverdine production in all tested pseudomonas species. these data strongly suggest that the role of pvdq in pyoverdine biosynthesis is conserved among pseudomonas spp., while the control that pvdq exerts in p. aeruginosa over its own quorum-sensing signals seems to be unique to this bacterium.

TI  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 causes induced systemic resistance and changes in arabidopsis root exudation.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440 is an efficient colonizer of the rhizosphere of plants  of agronomical and basic interest. we have demonstrated that kt2440 can protect the model plant arabidopsis thaliana against infection by the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. p. putida extracellular haem-peroxidase (pp2561) was found to be important for competitive colonization and essential for the induction of plant systemic resistance. root exudates of plants elicited by kt2440 exhibited distinct patterns of metabolites compared with those of non-elicited plants. the levels of some of these compounds were dramatically reduced in axenic plants or plants colonized by a mutant defective in pp2561, which has increased sensitiveness to oxidative stress with respect to the wild type. thus high-level oxidative stress resistance is a bacterial driving force in the rhizosphere for efficient colonization and to induce systemic resistance. these results provide important new insight into the complex events that occur in order for plants to attain resistance against foliar pathogens.

TI  == metabolic engineering for ethylene production by inserting the ethylene-forming enzyme gene (efe) at the 16s rdna sites of pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == the ethylene-forming enzyme gene (efe) from pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea was transferred into pseudomonas putida kt2440 by recombination at five of the seven  16s rdna sites. pcr analysis demonstrated that strains dc1, dc2 and dc3 contained three, four and five copies of efe, respectively. in contrast to the parent strain which produced ethylene at 14.7 mg h(-1) g(-1) dry weight, strains dc1, dc2 and dc3 produced ethylene at 36.2, 47.2 and 53.8 mg h(-1) g(-1) dry weight, respectively. quantitative pcr showed that efe mrna levels increased with increasing efe copy numbers. when additional copies of efe were introduced into strain dc3 via the broad-host-range plasmid pbbr1mcs2 an ethylene production rate of 80.2 mg h(-1) g(-1) dry weight was obtained and 489 mg ethylene was produced in 24h corresponding to a conversion rate of 21.7 mg ethylene g(-1) glucose. our  results indicated that p. putida kt2440 could be genetically modified to be a promising biomaterial producer.

TI  == iron uptake and metabolism in pseudomonads.
AB  == pseudomonads are ubiquitous gram-negative gamma proteobacteria known for their extreme versatility and adaptability. some are plant pathogens (pseudomonas syringae) which have to survive on the surface of leaves while others can colonize the rhizosphere or survive in soil (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida), and one species, pseudomonas entomophila, is an insect pathogen. the most investigated species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, is known to be an opportunistic pathogen able to infect plants, nematodes, insects, and mammals, including humans. like for other bacteria, iron is a key nutrient for pseudomonads. the fluorescent pseudomonads produce siderophores, the best known being the fluorescent high-affinity peptidic pyoverdines. often diverse secondary siderophores of lower affinity are produced as well (pyochelin, pseudomonin, corrugatins and ornicorrugatins, yersiniabactin, and thioquinolobactin). reflecting their large capacity of adaptation to changing environment and niche colonization, pseudomonads are able to obtain their iron from heme or from siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores) via the expression of outer membrane tonb-dependent receptors. as expected, iron uptake is exquisitely and hierarchically regulated in these bacteria. in this short review, the diversity of siderophores produced, receptors, and finally the way iron homeostasis is regulated in p. aeruginosa, p. syringae, p. putida, and p. fluorescens, will be presented and, when possible, put in relation with the lifestyle and the ecological niche.

TI  == dna sequence-based analysis of the pseudomonas species.
AB  == partial sequences of four core 'housekeeping' genes (16s rrna, gyrb, rpob and rpod) of the type strains of 107 pseudomonas species were analysed in order to obtain a comprehensive view regarding the phylogenetic relationships within the pseudomonas genus. gene trees allowed the discrimination of two lineages or intrageneric groups (ig), called ig p. aeruginosa and ig p. fluorescens. the first ig p. aeruginosa, was divided into three main groups, represented by the species p. aeruginosa, p. stutzeri and p. oleovorans. the second ig was divided into six groups, represented by the species p. fluorescens, p. syringae, p. lutea, p. putida, p. anguilliseptica and p. straminea. the p. fluorescens group was the most complex and included nine subgroups, represented by the species p. fluorescens, p. gessardi, p. fragi, p. mandelii, p. jesseni, p. koreensis, p. corrugata, p. chlororaphis and p. asplenii. pseudomonas rhizospherae was affiliated with the p. fluorescens ig in the phylogenetic analysis but was independent of any group. some species were located on phylogenetic branches that were distant from defined clusters, such as those represented by the p. oryzihabitans group and the type strains p. pachastrellae, p. pertucinogena and p. luteola. additionally, 17 strains of p. aeruginosa, 'p. entomophila', p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. syringae and p. stutzeri, for which genome sequences have been determined, have been included to compare the results obtained in the analysis of four housekeeping genes with those obtained from whole genome analyses.

TI  == npr1 protein regulates pathogenic and symbiotic interactions between rhizobium and legumes and non-legumes.
AB  == background: legumes are unique in their ability to establish symbiotic interaction with rhizobacteria from rhizobium genus, which provide them with available nitrogen. nodulation factors (nfs) produced by rhizobium initiate legume root hair deformation and curling that entrap the bacteria, and allow it to grow inside the plant. in contrast, legumes and non-legumes activate defense responses when inoculated with pathogenic bacteria. one major defense pathway is  mediated by salicylic acid (sa). sa is sensed and transduced to downstream defense components by a redox-regulated protein called npr1. methodology/principal findings: we used arabidopsis mutants in sa defense pathway to test the role of npr1 in symbiotic interactions. inoculation of sinorhizobium  meliloti or purified nf on medicago truncatula or nim1/npr1 a. thaliana mutants induced root hair deformation and transcription of early and late nodulins. application of s. meliloti or nf on m. truncatula or a. thaliana roots also induced a strong oxidative burst that lasted much longer than in plants inoculated with pathogenic or mutualistic bacteria. transient overexpression of npr1 in m. truncatula suppressed root hair curling, while inhibition of npr1 expression by rnai accelerated curling. conclusions/significance: we show that, while npr1 has a positive effect on pathogen resistance, it has a negative effect on symbiotic interactions, by inhibiting root hair deformation and nodulin expression. our results also show that basic plant responses to rhizobium inoculation are conserved in legumes and non-legumes.

TI  == biosynthesis of the proteasome inhibitor syringolin a: the ureido group joining two amino acids originates from bicarbonate.
AB  == background: syringolin a, an important virulence factor in the interaction of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a with its host plant phaseolus vulgaris (bean), was recently shown to irreversibly inhibit eukaryotic proteasomes by a novel mechanism. syringolin a is synthesized by a mixed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase and consists of a tripeptide part including a twelve-membered ring with an n-terminal valine that is joined to a second valine via a very unusual ureido group. analysis of sequence and architecture of the syringolin a synthetase gene cluster with the five open reading frames syla-syle allowed to formulate a biosynthesis model that explained all structural features of the tripeptide part of syringolin a but left the biosynthesis of the unusual ureido group unaccounted for. results: we have cloned a 22 kb genomic fragment containing the syla-syle gene cluster but no other complete gene into the broad host range cosmid plafr3. transfer of the recombinant cosmid into pseudomonas putida and p. syringae pv. syringae sm was sufficient to direct the biosynthesis of bona fide syringolin a in these heterologous organisms whose genomes do not contain homologous genes. nmr analysis of syringolin a isolated from cultures grown in the presence of nah(13)co(3) revealed preferential (13)c-labeling at the ureido carbonyl position. conclusion: the results show that no additional syringolin a-specific genes were needed for the biosynthesis of the enigmatic ureido group joining two  amino acids. they reveal the source of the ureido carbonyl group to be bicarbonate/carbon dioxide, which we hypothesize is incorporated by carbamylation of valine mediated by the sylc gene product(s). a similar mechanism may also play a role in the biosynthesis of other ureido-group-containing nrps products known largely from cyanobacteria.

TI  == improved phosphate biosorption by bacterial surface display of phosphate-binding  protein utilizing ice nucleation protein.
AB  == the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (ebpr) system often deteriorates at low chemical oxygen demand (cod) or under aeration conditions. a  new approach that incorporates phosphate-eutrophic wastewater remediation was introduced through immobilization of an intracellular phosphate-binding protein (pbp) onto the surface of pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli, using the n-terminal anchor (inaq-n) of a newly identified ice nucleation protein from pseudomonas syringae. a green fluorescent protein-fusion protein was expressed and used to confirm surface localization. the pbp was then targeted to the surface of e. coli jm109 and p. putida ab92019. the engineered p. putida and e. coli microorganisms were capable of absolute biosorption of total phosphates at rates of 60 and 80 mg l(-1), respectively, over 5 h. in the recombinant p. putida cells, a surface-immobilized pbp fusion that had three tandemly repeated inaq-ns  exhibited the maximum increment in phosphate biosorption, at sixfold compared with the control strain. even heat-killed recombinant cells of either p. putida or e. coli retained substantial biosorptive activities. the current study demonstrates that the bacterial surface display of pbp should be considered as a  strong contender for generating organisms capable of functioning in ebpr systems  under low cod, resulting in improved removal of eutrophic phosphorus from wastewaters.

TI  == a survey of tonb-dependent receptors in fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  == for bacteria with an aerobic lifestyle, iron is in the oxidized fe(3+) form, hence poorly soluble. the solution is the synthesis and excretion of siderophores with a high affinity for iron. these ferrisiderophores are recognized by tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors in gram-negative bacteria. haem is also a source of iron and is captured via tonb-dependent receptors as well. in many cases bacterial genomes encode genes for receptors for siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores). pseudomonads are known for their high adaptive capacity and it is therefore not surprising to find a relatively large number of genes encoding these receptors. in this study we analysed the genomes of three fluorescent pseudomonads available in the pseudomonas genome database (http://www.pseudomonas.com; p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. syringae) in order to extract the genes coding for tonb-dependent receptors. as expected we observed differences between species for the number of receptors. we also report differences within species, suggesting the acquisition of some genes via horizontal gene transfer, including those coding for the ferripyoverdine receptors. we also report cases where duplications of receptor genes are observed and the presence of 'receptor islands'. our study strongly supports the notion of 'core' and 'accessory' tonb-dependent receptors within each species, with the ferripyoverdine receptors belonging to the last category.

TI  == siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in the entomopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas entomophila l48 and its close relative pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == pseudomonas entomophila l48 is a recently identified entomopathogenic bacterium which, upon ingestion, kills drosophila melanogaster, and is closely related to p. putida. the complete genome of this species has been sequenced and therefore a genomic, genetic and structural analysis of the siderophore-mediated iron acquisition was undertaken. p. entomophila produces two siderophores, a structurally new and unique pyoverdine and the secondary siderophore pseudomonine, already described in p. fluorescens species. structural analysis of the pyoverdine produced by the closely related p. putida kt2440 showed that this  strain produces an already characterised pyoverdine, but different from p. entomophila, and no evidence was found for the production of a second siderophore. growth stimulation assays with heterologous pyoverdines demonstrated that p. entomophila is able to utilize a large variety of structurally distinct pyoverdines produced by other pseudomonas species. in contrast, p. putida kt2440  is able to utilize only its own pyoverdine and the pyoverdine produced by p. syringae lmg 1247. our data suggest that although closely related, p. entomophila is a more efficient competitor for iron than p. putida.

AB  == pseudomonas putida strain p9 is a novel competent endophyte from potato. p9 causes cultivar-dependent suppression of phytophthora infestans. colonization of  the rhizoplane and endosphere of potato plants by p9 and its rifampin-resistant derivative p9r was studied. the purposes of this work were to follow the fate of  p9 inside growing potato plants and to establish its effect on associated microbial communities. the effects of p9 and p9r inoculation were studied in two  separate experiments. the roots of transplants of three different cultivars of potato were dipped in suspensions of p9 or p9r cells, and the plants were planted in soil. the fate of both strains was followed by examining colony growth and by  performing pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). colonies of both strains were recovered from rhizoplane and endosphere samples of all three cultivars at two growth stages. a conspicuous band, representing p9 and p9r, was  found in all pseudomonas pcr-dgge fingerprints for treated plants. the numbers of p9r cfu and the p9r-specific band intensities for the different replicate samples were positively correlated, as determined by linear regression analysis. the effects of plant growth stage, genotype, and the presence of p9r on associated microbial communities were examined by multivariate and unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analyses of pcr-dgge fingerprints. the presence of strain p9r had an effect on bacterial groups identified as pseudomonas azotoformans, pseudomonas veronii, and pseudomonas syringae. in conclusion, strain p9 is an avid colonizer of potato plants, competing with microbial populations indigenous to the potato phytosphere. bacterization with a  biocontrol agent has an important and previously unexplored effect on plant-associated communities.

TI  == pseudomonas cichorii as the causal agent of midrib rot, an emerging disease of greenhouse-grown butterhead lettuce in flanders.
AB  == bacterial midrib rot of greenhouse-grown butterhead lettuce (lactuca sativa l. var. capitata) is an emerging disease in flanders (belgium) and fluorescent pseudomonads are suspected to play an important role in the disease. isolations from infected lettuces, collected from 14 commercial greenhouses in flanders, yielded 149 isolates that were characterized polyphasically, which included morphological characteristics, pigmentation, pathogenicity tests by both injection and spraying of lettuce, lopat characteristics, fame analysis, box-pcr  fingerprinting, 16s rrna and rpob gene sequencing, as well as dna-dna hybridization. ninety-eight isolates (66%) exhibited a fluorescent pigmentation and were associated with the genus pseudomonas. fifty-five of them induced an hr+ (hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves) response. the other 43 fluorescent isolates were most probably saprophytic bacteria and about half of them were able to cause rot on potato tuber slices. box-pcr genomic fingerprinting was used to assess the genetic diversity of the pseudomonas midrib rot isolates. the delineated box-pcr patterns matched quite well with pseudomonas morphotypes defined on the basis of colony appearance and variation in fluorescent pigmentation. 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses allowed most of the fluorescent isolates to be allocated to pseudomonas, and they belonged to either  the pseudomonas fluorescens group, pseudomonas putida group, or the pseudomonas cichorii/syringae group. in particular, the isolates allocated to this latter group constituted the vast majority of hr+ isolates and were identified as p. cichorii by dna-dna hybridization. they were demonstrated by spray-inoculation tests on greenhouse-grown lettuce to induce the midrib rot disease and could be re-isolated from lesions of inoculated plants. four hr+ non-fluorescent isolates  associated with one sample that showed an atypical midrib rot were identified as  dickeya sp.

TI  == involvement of microorganisms other than pseudomonad's on the degradation of the  non-fumigant organophosphate nematicide fenamiphos.
AB  == fenamiphos is a broad spectrum, non-volatile, systemic, organophosphorus nematicide extensively used throughout the world to control plant-parasitic nematodes. the efficacy of this nematicide can decrease in soils where microorganisms accumulate that are capable of rapidly degrading the active ingredient. among the documented microorganisms to degrade organophosphate compounds, pseudomonas spp. was frequently identified. however, it still not clear whether or not this bacterial genus is the major responsible one in the biodegradation process. our objective was to study the roll of pseudomonas spp. and other soil bacteria on the degradation of fenamiphos in soils with different  nematicide application history. in some of these soils fenamiphos metabolizing microorganisms were found, whereas in others not. for example, a soil with 42 fenamiphos applications during 16 years neither contained pseudomonas spp. nor biodegrading microorganisms. in two different soils, both with 25 fenamiphos applications in 12 years and containing metabolizing microorganisms, only one of  them contained pseudomonas spp., demonstrating that the nematicide was rapidly metabolized by microorganisms other than pseudomonas spp. conversely, a control soil, with no previous nematicide application history, contained the highest number of pseudomonas spp. of all soils analyzed. the number of bacteria of this  genus could be increased when compost was added, although this did not alter the  lack of the fenamiphos degradation process, even after six weeks and three consecutive nematicide treatments. the pseudomonas diversity of the non-degrading control soil was composed of p. putida (50%), p. fluorescens (31%), p. syringae (13%) and p. chlororaphis (6%) according to gas chromatography identification. individual analysis of the pseudomonas spp. bacteria showed that none were capable of metabolizing fenamiphos in vitro. in conclusion, we demonstrated that  pseudomonas spp. are not intrinsically capable of fenamiphos metabolization. we also found that pseudomonas spp. may not always accumulate upon fenamiphos treatment and that there are other microorganisms able to metabolize this nematicide.

TI  == impact of wheat cultivation on microbial communities from replant soils and apple growth in greenhouse trials.
AB  == abstract studies were conducted to assess the impact of short-term rotations of wheat on microbial community composition and growth of apple in soils from replant orchard sites. soils from two orchards were cultivated with three successive 28-day growth cycles of 'eltan', 'penewawa', or 'rely' wheat in the greenhouse and subsequently planted to 'gala' apple seedlings. cultivation of orchard replant soils with any of the three wheat cultivars enhanced growth of apple relative to that achieved in untreated soils. improved growth was associated with a marked reduction in apple root infection by species of rhizoctonia and pythium. populations of plant-parasitic nematodes were below damage threshold levels in these orchard soils; however, apple seedlings grown in wheat-cultivated soils had significantly lower root populations of pratylenchus spp. than did seedlings grown in untreated soils. growth of apple in 'penewawa'-cultivated soils often was superior to that observed in soils planted  with 'eltan' or 'rely'. in untreated orchard soils, fluorescent pseudomonad populations isolated from soil and the apple rhizosphere were dominated by pseudomonas fluorescens biotype c and pseudomonas syringae. cultivation of replant soils with wheat induced a characteristic transformation of the fluorescent pseudomonad population, and pseudomonas putida dominated the population of this bacterial group recovered from wheat-cultivated replant orchard soils. results from this study suggest that use of short-term wheat cropping sequences during orchard renovation could be useful in management of replant disease and that this disease-control option may operate, in part, through modification of the fluorescent pseudomonad community.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae bett is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. in this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (bcct) in p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. this transporter has a particularly low affinity (k(m) of 876 microm) and high capacity (v(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known bccts. although bett activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, bett mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. growth studies with mutants deficient in bett and  other choline transporters demonstrated that bett was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to p. syringae by choline over glycine betaine  when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microm). these results suggest that p. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of p. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. among the three putative bcct family transporters in pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to escherichia coli bett than to p. syringae bett. functional p. putida and p. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a  long c-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for p. syringae bett using deletion derivatives.

TI  == alginate production by pseudomonas putida creates a hydrated microenvironment and contributes to biofilm architecture and stress tolerance under water-limiting conditions.
AB  == biofilms exist in a variety of habitats that are routinely or periodically not saturated with water, and residents must integrate cues on water abundance (matric stress) or osmolarity (solute stress) into lifestyle strategies. here we  examine this hypothesis by assessing the extent to which alginate production by pseudomonas putida strain mt-2 and by other fluorescent pseudomonads occurs in response to water limitations and how the presence of alginate in turn influences biofilm development and stress tolerance. total exopolysaccharide (eps) and alginate production increased with increasing matric, but not solute, stress severity, and alginate was a significant component, but not the major component,  of eps. alginate influenced biofilm architecture, resulting in biofilms that were taller, covered less surface area, and had a thicker eps layer at the air interface than those formed by an mt-2 algd mutant under water-limiting conditions, properties that could contribute to less evaporative water loss. we examined this possibility and show that alginate reduces the extent of water loss from biofilm residents by using a biosensor to quantify the water potential of individual cells and by measuring the extent of dehydration-mediated changes in fatty acid composition following a matric or solute stress shock. alginate deficiency decreased survival of desiccation not only by p. putida but also by pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a. our findings suggest that in response to water-limiting conditions, pseudomonads produce alginate, which influences biofilm development and eps physiochemical properties. collectively these responses may facilitate the maintenance of a hydrated microenvironment, protecting residents from desiccation stress and increasing survival.

TI  == rhizobacteria-induced priming in arabidopsis is dependent on ethylene, jasmonic acid, and npr1.
AB  == a nonpathogenic rhizobacterium, pseudomonas putida lsw17s, elicited systemic protection against fusarium wilt and pith necrosis caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and p. corrugata in tomato (lycopersicon esculentum l.). lsw17s also confers disease resistance against p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (dc3000) on arabidopsis ecotype col-0. to investigate mechanisms underlying disease protection, expression patterns of defense-related genes pr1, pr2, pr5, and pdf1.2 and cellular defense responses such as hydrogen peroxide accumulation  and callose deposition were investigated. lsw17s treatment exhibited the typical  phenomena of priming. strong and faster transcription of defense-related genes was induced and hydrogen peroxide or callose were accumulated in arabidopsis treated with lsw17s and infected with dc3000. in contrast, individual actions of  lsw17s and dc3000 did not elicit rapid molecular and cellular defense responses.  priming by lsw17s was translocated systemically and retained for more than 10 days. treatment with lsw17s reduced pathogen proliferation in arabidopsis ecotype col-0 expressing bacterial nahg; however, npr1, etr1, and jar1 mutations impaired inhibition of pathogen growth. cellular and molecular priming responses support these results. in sum, lsw17s primes arabidopsis for npr1-, ethylene-, and jasmonic acid-dependent disease resistance, and efficient molecular and cellular  defense responses.

TI  == surface display of mph on pseudomonas putida js444 using ice nucleation protein and its application in detoxification of organophosphates.
AB  == methyl parathion hydrolase (mph) has been displayed on the surface of microorganisms for the first time using only n- and c-terminal domains of the ice nucleation protein (inpnc) from pseudomonas syringae ina5 as an anchoring motif.  a shuttle vector pincm coding for inpnc-mph was constructed and used to target mph onto the surface of a natural p-nitrophenol (pnp) degrader, pseudomonas putida js444, overcoming the potential substrate uptake limitation. over 90% of the mph activity was located on the cell surface as determined by protease accessibility and cell fractionation experiments. the surface localization of the inpnc-mph fusion was further verified by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. the engineered p. putida js444 degraded organophosphates as well as pnp rapidly without growth inhibition. compared to organophosphorus hydrolase-displaying systems reported, changes in substrate specificity highlight an important potential use of the engineered strain for the clean-up of specific organophosphate nerve agents.

TI  == a novel approach for the identification of bacterial taxa-specific molecular markers.
AB  == aims: to develop and establish a methodology for an oriented and fast identification of species taxa-specific molecular markers useful for the identification of micro-organisms. methods and results: from the complete microbial genomes available in pfam database, taxa-specific protein domains were  identified which lead to the selection of taxa-specific loci. this strategy was used to identify six genetic markers: four specific for pseudomonas syringae pv.  tomato, one specific for p. syringae pv. syringae and one specific for p. putida. the discriminatory potential of these loci was evaluated by southern hybridization using several pseudomonad species and pathovars, by dot-blot hybridization and by multiplex pcr optimized for the simultaneous detection of p. putida, p. syringae pv. syringae and p. syringae pv. tomato. sensitivity assays indicated a detection limit of approximately 10 pg of chromosomal dna template needed for each bacterium. conclusions: the proposed methodology was efficient on the selection of six pseudomonas-specific markers able to discriminate pseudomonas at the species and pathovar level. significance and impact of the study: the oriented search of taxa-specific molecular probes described in this work, which can be easily extended to other groups of bacteria, will improve the  accuracy and expedite the identification of micro-organisms by dna-based molecular methods.

TI  == biofilm formation and cellulose expression among diverse environmental pseudomonas isolates.
AB  == the ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. a survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (a-l) interface after selection in static microcosms. considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. calcofluor  epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by pseudomonas asplenii, pseudomonas corrugata, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas marginalis, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas savastanoi and pseudomonas syringae isolates. cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active wspr19 mutant of the cyclic-di-gmp-associated, ggdef domain-containing response regulator involved in  the p. fluorescens sbw25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01. wspr19 could also induce p. putida kt2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as escherichia  coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2, both of which express cellulose yet lack wspr homologues. statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm  development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. this complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == improving the specificity of high-throughput ortholog prediction.
AB  == background: orthologs (genes that have diverged after a speciation event) tend to have similar function, and so their prediction has become an important component  of comparative genomics and genome annotation. the gold standard phylogenetic analysis approach of comparing available organismal phylogeny to gene phylogeny is not easily automated for genome-wide analysis; therefore, ortholog prediction  for large genome-scale datasets is typically performed using a reciprocal-best-blast-hits (rbh) approach. one problem with rbh is that it will incorrectly predict a paralog as an ortholog when incomplete genome sequences or  gene loss is involved. in addition, there is an increasing interest in identifying orthologs most likely to have retained similar function. results: to  address these issues, we present here a high-throughput computational method named ortholuge that further evaluates previously predicted orthologs (including  those predicted using an rbh-based approach) - identifying which orthologs most closely reflect species divergence and may more likely have similar function. ortholuge analyzes phylogenetic distance ratios involving two comparison species  and an outgroup species, noting cases where relative gene divergence is atypical. it also identifies some cases of gene duplication after species divergence. through simulations of incomplete genome data/gene loss, we show that the vast majority of genes falsely predicted as orthologs by an rbh-based method can be identified. ortholuge was then used to estimate the number of false-positives (predominantly paralogs) in selected rbh-predicted ortholog datasets, identifying approximately 10% paralogs in a eukaryotic data set (mouse-rat comparison) and 5% in a bacterial data set (pseudomonas putida - pseudomonas syringae species comparison). higher quality (more precise) datasets of orthologs, which we term "ssd-orthologs" (supporting-species-divergence-orthologs), were also constructed. these datasets, as well as ortholuge software that may be used to characterize other species' datasets, are available at http://www.pathogenomics.ca/ortholuge/  (software under gnu general public license). conclusion: the ortholuge method reported here appears to significantly improve the specificity (precision) of high-throughput ortholog prediction for both bacterial and eukaryotic species. this method, and its associated software, will aid those performing various comparative genomics-based analyses, such as the prediction of conserved regulatory elements upstream of orthologous genes.

TI  == bacterial repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences are dna targets for insertion sequence elements.
AB  == background: mobile elements are involved in genomic rearrangements and virulence  acquisition, and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. the insertion of some specific insertion sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) elements. considering that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with described reps, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively analyze the relationship between rep sequences and mobile elements.  results: this global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. the study is based on the analysis of the dna regions surrounding the 981 instances of insertion sequence elements with respect to the positioning of rep sequences in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes corresponding to species of bacteria with reported rep sequences. this analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion into rep sequences for ispsy8 in pseudomonas syringae dc3000,  ispa11 in p. aeruginosa pa01, isppu9 and isppu10 in p. putida kt2440, and isrm22  and isrm19 in sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 genome. preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with rep sequences has also been detected for ispsy7 in p. syringae dc3000, isrm5 in s. meliloti and isnm1106 in neisseria meningitidis mc58 and z2491 genomes. probably, the association with rep elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more frequent in natural isolates. conclusion: our findings characterize rep elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce the relationship between rep sequences and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. in addition, this study defines a subset of rep-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation.

TI  == expression analysis of the fpr (ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase) gene in pseudomonas putida kt2440.
AB  == the ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase (fpr) participates in cellular defense against oxidative damage. the fpr expression in pseudomonas putida kt2440 is induced by oxidative and osmotic stresses. finr, a lysr-type transcriptional factor near the fpr gene in the p. putida kt2440 genome, is required for induction of the fpr under both conditions. we have shown that the fpr and finr gene products can counteract the effects of oxidative and osmotic stresses. interestingly, finr-independent expression occurs either during a long period of incubation with paraquat or with high concentrations of oxidative stress agent. this result indicates that there may be additional regulators present in the p. putida kt2440 genome. in contrast to in vivo expression kinetics of fpr from the plant pathogen, pseudomonas syringae, the fpr gene from p. putida kt2440 exhibited unusually prolonged expression after oxidative stress. transcriptional fusion and northern blot analysis studies indicated that the finr is negatively autoregulated. expression of the fpr promoter was higher in minimal media than in rich media during exponential phase growth. consistent with this result, the fpr  and finr mutants had a long lag phase in minimal media in contrast to wild-type growth characteristics. antioxidants such as ascorbate could increase the growth  rate of all tested strains in minimal media. this result confirmed that p. putida kt2440 experienced more oxidative stress during exponential growth in minimal media than in rich media. endogenous promoter activity of the fpr gene is much higher during exponential growth than during stationary growth. these findings demonstrate new relationships between fpr, finr, and the physiology of oxidative  stress in p. putida kt2440.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == changes in race-specific virulence in pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola are associated with a chimeric transposable element and rare deletion events in a plasmid-borne pathogenicity island.
AB  == virulence for bean and soybean is determined by effector genes in a plasmid-borne pathogenicity island (pai) in race 7 strain 1449b of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. one of the effector genes, avrpphf, confers either pathogenicity, virulence, or avirulence depending on the plant host and is absent from races 2,  3, 4, 6, and 8 of this pathogen. analysis of cosmid clones and comparison of dna  sequences showed that the absence of avrpphf from strain 1448a is due to deletion of a continuous 9.5-kb fragment. the remainder of the pai is well conserved in strains 1448a and 1449b. the left junction of the deleted region consists of a chimeric transposable element generated from the fusion of homologs of is1492 from pseudomonas putida and is1090 from ralstonia eutropha. the borders of the deletion were conserved in 66 p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strains isolated in different countries and representing the five races lacking avrpphf. however, six strains isolated in spain had a 10.5-kb deletion that extended 1 kb further from  the right junction. the perfect conservation of the 28-nucleotide right repeat of the is1090 homolog in the two deletion types and in the other 47 insertions of the is1090 homolog in the 1448a genome strongly suggests that the avrpphf deletions were mediated by the activity of the chimeric mobile element. our data  strongly support a clonal origin for the races of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola lacking avrpphf.

TI  == colonization of the arabidopsis rhizosphere by fluorescent pseudomonas spp. activates a root-specific, ethylene-responsive pr-5 gene in the vascular bundle.
AB  == plants of which the roots are colonized by selected strains of non-pathogenic, fluorescent pseudomonas spp. develop an enhanced defensive capacity against a broad spectrum of foliar pathogens. in arabidopsis thaliana, this rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance (isr) functions independently of salicylic acid but requires responsiveness to jasmonic acid and ethylene. in contrast to pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance (sar), isr is not associated with systemic changes in the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (pr) proteins. to identify genes that are specifically expressed in response to colonization of the roots by isr-inducing pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r bacteria, we screened a collection of arabidopsis enhancer trap and gene trap lines containing a transposable element of the ac/ds system and the gus reporter gene. we identified an enhancer trap line (wet121) that specifically showed gus activity in the root vascular bundle upon colonization of the roots by wcs417r. fluorescent pseudomonas spp. strains p. fluorescens wcs374r and p. putida wcs358r triggered a similar expression pattern, whereas isr-non-inducing escherichia coli bacteria did not. exogenous application of the  ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) mimicked the rhizobacteria-induced gus expression pattern in the root vascular bundle, whereas methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid did not, indicating that the ds element in wet121 is inserted in the vicinity of an ethylene-responsive gene. analysis of the expression of the genes in the close vicinity of the ds element revealed attlp1 as the gene responsible for the in cis activation of the gus reporter gene in the root vascular bundle. attlp1 encodes a thaumatin-like protein that belongs to the pr-5 family of pr proteins, some of which possess antimicrobial properties. attlp1 knockout mutant plants showed normal levels of wcs417r-mediated isr against the bacterial leaf pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, suggesting that expression of attlp1 in the roots is not required  for systemic expression of isr in the leaves. together, these results indicate that induction of attlp1 is a local response of arabidopsis roots to colonization by non-pathogenic fluorescent pseudomonas spp. and is unlikely to play a role in  systemic resistance.

TI  == characterization of copabcd operon from a copper-sensitive pseudomonas putida strain.
AB  == we describe an operon, copabcd, that encodes copper-binding and sequestering proteins for copper homeostasis in the copper-sensitive strain pseudomonas putida pnl-mk25. this is the second operon characterized as being involved in copper homeostasis, in addition to a p1-type atpase encoded by cuear, which was previously shown to be active in the same strain. in this study, 3 copper-responsive mutants were obtained through mini-tn5::gfp mutagenesis and were found to exhibit reduced tolerance to copper. sequencing analysis of the transposon-tagged region in the 3 mutants revealed insertions in 2 genes of an operon homologous to the copabcd of p. syringae and pcoabcd of escherichia coli.  gene expression studies demonstrated that the p. putida copabcd is inducible starting from 3 micromol/l copper levels. copper-sensitivity studies revealed that the tolerance of the mutant strains was reduced only marginally (only 0.16-fold) in comparison to a 6-fold reduced tolerance of the cuear mutant. thus, the cop operon in this strain has a minimal role when compared with its role both in other copper-resistant strains, such as p. syringae pv. syringae, and in the cuear operon of the same strain. we propose that the reduced function of the copabcd operon is likely to be due to the presence of fewer metal-binding domains in the encoded proteins.

TI  == repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences in the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 genome: extragenic signals for genome reannotation.
AB  == repetitive extragenic palindromic (reps) sequences were first described in enterobacteriacea and later in pseudomonas putida. we have detected a new variant (51 base pairs) of rep sequences that appears to be disseminated in more than 300 copies in the pseudomonas syringae dc3000 genome. the finding of rep sequences in p. syringae confirms the broad presence of this type of repetitive sequence in bacteria. we analyzed the distribution of rep sequences and the structure of the  clusters, and we show that palindromy is conserved. rep sequences appear to be allocated to the extragenic space, with a special preference for the intergenic spaces limited by convergent genes, while their presence is scarce between divergent genes. using rep sequences as markers of extragenicity we re-annotated  a set of genes of the p. syringae dc3000 genome demonstrating that rep sequences  can be used for refinement of annotation of a genome. the similarity detected between virulence genes from evolutionarily distant pathogenic bacteria suggests  the acquisition of clusters of virulence genes by horizontal gene transfer. we did not detect the presence of p. syringae rep elements in the principal pathogenicity gene clusters. this absence suggests that genome fragments lacking  rep sequences could point to regions recently acquired from other organisms, and  rep sequences might be new tracers for gaining insight into key aspects of bacterial genome evolution, especially when studying pathogenicity acquisition. in addition, as the p. syringae rep sequence is species-specific with respect to  the sequenced genomes, it is an exceptional candidate for use as a fingerprint in precise genotyping and epidemiological studies.

TI  == determinants of pseudomonas putida wcs358 involved in inducing systemic resistance in plants.
AB  == summary pseudomonas putida wcs358 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium originally isolated from the rhizosphere of potato. it can suppress soil-borne plant diseases by siderophore-mediated competition for iron, but it has also been reported to result in induced systemic resistance (isr) in arabidopsis thaliana.  bacterial determinants of this strain involved in inducing systemic resistance in arabidopsis were investigated using a tn5 transposon mutant defective in biosynthesis of the fluorescent siderophore pseudobactin, a non-motile tn5 mutant lacking flagella, and a spontaneous phage-resistant mutant lacking the o-antigenic side chain of the lipopolysaccharides (lps). when using pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato as the challenging pathogen, purified pseudobactin, flagella  and lps all triggered isr. however, the mutants were all as effective as the parental strain, suggesting redundancy in isr-triggering traits in wcs358. the botrytis cinerea-tomato, b. cinerea-bean and colletotrichum lindemuthianum-bean model systems were used to test further the potential of p. putida wcs358 to induce isr. strain wcs358 significantly reduced disease development in all three  systems, indicating that also on tomato and bean wcs358 can trigger isr. in both  tomato and bean, the lps mutant had lost the ability to induce resistance, whereas the flagella mutant was still effective. in bean, the pseudobactin mutant was still effective, whereas this mutant has lost its effectivity in tomato. in both bean and tomato, flagella isolated from the parental strain were not effective, whereas lps or pseudobactin did induce systemic resistance.

AB  == summary comparative analyses of the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  dc3000 with the finished, complete genomes of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, an animal pathogen, and the non-pathogenic soil inhabitant pseudomonas putida kt2440 revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in genes involved in 'housekeeping functions'. however, divergence is present among these three fluorescent pseudomonads, yielding 'suites' of species-specific genes that may provide the genetic basis for adaptation to an ecological niche and lifestyle. for dc3000, 1053 genes located on the chromosome were specific to dc3000 and not  present in pao1 or kt2440. the majority of these dc3000-specific genes either lack a known function or are mobile genetic elements. however, these genes do share features among themselves such as association with regions of atypical trinucleotides, unusual g+c content and localization within large tracts of dc3000-specific sequence, suggestive of lateral gene transfer events. indeed, a comparison of syntenic blocks among these three complete pseudomonas genomes revealed that a substantial portion (533) of the dc3000-specific chromosomal genes (1053) were located in lineage-specific regions (defined as being larger than 2 kb and enriched in mobile genetic elements and/or genes specific to dc3000 in this three-way comparison). a large proportion of mobile genetic elements (199 of 318 genes; 63%), which are highly enriched in dc3000, were present within such regions. similarly, most of the genes encoding type iii secretion system virulence effectors were located in lineage-specific regions. consistent with the plasticity of the dc3000 genome, a putative chromosomal inversion mediated by identical copies of ispsy6 involving 2838 kb (44%) of the dc3000 genome was detected. these data suggest that a substantial portion of the differentiation of dc3000, a plant pathogen, from an animal pathogen and a soil inhabitant has involved transfer of a large number of novel genes coupled with amplification of  mobile genetic elements.

TI  == identification of a novel steroid inducible gene associated with the beta hsd locus of comamonas testosteroni.
AB  == comamonas testosteroni is a soil bacterium, which can use a variety of steroids as carbon and energy source. even if it can be estimated that the complete degradation of the steroid nucleus requires more than 20 enzymatic reactions, the complete molecular characterization of the genes encoding these steroid degradative enzymes as well as the genetic organization of them remain to be elucidated. we have previously reported the cloning and nucleotide sequence of two steroid-inducible genes, beta hsd and stdc encoding 3 beta-17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a hypothetical protein respectively, located in both ends of a 3.2kb hindiii fragment. herein, we report the cloning and characterization of another steroid-inducible gene, called sip48 (steroid inducible protein), located between these two genes. the analysis of sip48 amino  acid sequence predicts a protein of 438 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48.5 kda. this protein bears high homology with conserved hypothetical proteins of unknown function described in pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia fungorum, shewanella oneidensis, pseudomonas fluorescens and thauera aromatica. the predicted protein shows a typical structure of a leader peptide at its n-terminus. a 48.5 kda protein encoded by the recombinant plasmid was detected by sds-page analysis of in vitro [35s]-methionine labeled polypeptides. analysis of gene expression indicates that sip48 is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level by several steroid compounds. in addition, transcriptional analysis of sip48 and beta hsd in a sip48 mutant strain, indicates that both genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mrna. lacz transcriptional fusions integrated into the chromosome of c. testosteroni demonstrate that a steroid-inducible promoter located upstream of sip48 regulates the expression of both genes.

TI  == the complete genome sequence of the arabidopsis and tomato pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000.
AB  == we report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000 (dc3000), which is pathogenic on tomato and arabidopsis thaliana. the dc3000 genome (6.5 megabases) contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids, which collectively encode 5,763 orfs. we identified 298 established and putative virulence genes, including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type iii secretion system effector proteins. many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous  families and also were proximal to mobile elements, which collectively comprise 7% of the dc3000 genome. the bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients, particularly sugars, as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces. over 12% of the genes are dedicated to regulation, which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis. comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads, pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet revealed 1,159 genes unique to dc3000, of which 811 lack a known function.

TI  == transition from reversible to irreversible attachment during biofilm formation by pseudomonas fluorescens wcs365 requires an abc transporter and a large secreted protein.
AB  == we report the identification of an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter and an  associated large cell-surface protein that are required for biofilm formation by  pseudomonas fluorescens wcs365. the genes coding for these proteins are designated lap for large adhesion protein. the lapa protein, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 900 kda, is found to be loosely associated with the cell surface and present in the culture supernatant. the lapb, lapc and lape  proteins are predicted to be the cytoplasmic membrane-localized atpase, membrane  fusion protein and outer membrane protein component, respectively, of an abc transporter. consistent with this prediction, lape, like other members of this family, is localized to the outer membrane. we propose that the lapebc-encoded abc transporter participates in the secretion of lapa, as strains with mutations  in the lapebc genes do not have detectable lapa associated with the cell surface  or in the supernatant. the lap genes are conserved among environmental pseudomonads such as p. putida kt2440, p. fluorescens pfo1 and p. fluorescens wcs365, but are absent from pathogenic pseudomonads such as p. aeruginosa and p.  syringae. the wild-type strain of p. fluorescens wcs365 and its lap mutant derivatives were assessed for their biofilm forming ability in static and flow systems. the lap mutant strains are impaired in an early step in biofilm formation and are unable to develop the mature biofilm structure seen for the wild-type bacterium. time-lapse microscopy studies determined that the lap mutants are unable to progress from reversible (or transient) attachment to the irreversible attachment stage of biofilm development. the lap mutants were also found to be defective in attachment to quartz sand, an abiotic surface these organisms likely encounter in the environment.

TI  == long-term reduction of cold hardiness following ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria in the colorado potato beetle, leptinotarsa decemlineata.
AB  == we investigated the effect of ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria on the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the colorado potato beetle (leptinotarsa decemlineata say), a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters as  adults in shallow, terrestrial burrows. ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria (enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae), fed on slices of potato tuber, caused an abrupt decrease in supercooling capacity. no change occurred in the supercooling capacity of beetles fed escherichia coli, as this species lacks ice-nucleating activity. ingestion rates showed that tubers treated with different species were equally palatable. during diapause induction beetles evacuated food from their guts, but  nevertheless retained sufficient ice-nucleating bacteria to diminish supercooling. beetles fed p. fluorescens and p. putida exhibited reduced supercooling even after an 8-wk exposure to simulated winter conditions. furthermore, p. fluorescens was isolated 10-wk post-ingestion from diapausing beetles. our data suggest that ingested bacteria may be retained by insects during entry into diapause and that the cold hardiness of candidate crop pests, such as l. decemlineata, may be reduced by feeding them ice-nucleating bacteria prior to winter diapause.

TI  == multiple enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for high resolution distinction of pseudomonas (sensu stricto) 16s rrna genes.
AB  == members of the genus pseudomonas (sensu stricto) are important phytopathogens and agents of human infections, while other strains and species have beneficial bioremediation and biocontrol activities. traditionally, these important species  have been difficult to differentiate phenotypically; thus, rrna lineage analyses  have often been invoked. in this report, a newly developed approach is described  to rapidly detect and distinguish fluorescent pseudomonas isolates: pcr amplification of a pseudomonas-specific 990-bp ribosomal rna gene (rdna) fragment [appl. environ. microbiol. 64 (1998) 2545.] coupled with multiple enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism (merflp) analysis using a single digestion mixture of alui, hinfi, rsai, and tru9i incubated at 37 degrees c. the  method distinguished 116 published sequences and 47 reference strains of authentic pseudomonas representing 28 nomenspecies. a total of 55% (64/116) of the sequences analyzed by merflp were grouped into distinct phylogenetic clusters including pseudomonas putida, p. syringae, p. aeruginosa, p. stutzeri, and p. fluorescens. the utility of the merflps was confirmed when 100% (33/33) of the above named control reference strains were correctly placed into their phylogenetic clusters. the environmental relevance of the merflp method was confirmed when 67% of 28 forest and agricultural soil-derived presumptive pseudomonas environmental clones and isolates were placed into the five major pseudomonad clusters, one clone fell into the p. agarici cluster, and five clones clustered near related pseudomonads. these data demonstrated that the pcr-merflp  protocol provides an efficient and powerful tool for distinguishing isolates and  rdna gene libraries of environmental pseudomonas species.

TI  == homologous expression of the lipase and abc transporter gene cluster, tlidefa, enhances lipase secretion in pseudomonas spp.
AB  == the abc transporter tlidef was found to be an efficient secretory apparatus for extracellular lipase tlia in pseudomonas fluorescens. for the enhanced secretion  of the lipase, we tried to coexpress tlia and tlidef in various pseudomonas species. whereas the coexpression of tlia and tlidef was required for the lipase  secretion in p. fragi, the expression of tlia was sufficient for the lipase secretion in p. fluorescens, p. syringae, and p. putida, indicating the existence of compatible abc transporter in these species. however, p. fluorescens harboring tlidefa secreted much more lipase than p. fluorescens harboring only tlia, but the tlidef was functional only at temperatures below 30 degrees c. the recombinant p. fluorescens overexpressing tlidefa showed the highest secretion level, 217 u/ml. od (optical density) (28 microg/ml. od) of lipase in luria-bertani medium under microaerated conditions. with the increase of aeration, the lipase production was decreased and the lipase seemed to be degraded as the cells entered the cell death phase. these results demonstrate that p. fluorescens can be used as a host system for the secretory production of  the lipase using the abc transporter, thus producing lipase in over 14% of the total protein.

TI  == acyl-homoserine lactone production is more common among plant-associated pseudomonas spp. than among soilborne pseudomonas spp.
AB  == a total of 137 soilborne and plant-associated bacterial strains belonging to different pseudomonas species were tested for their ability to synthesize n-acyl-homoserine lactones (nahl). fifty-four strains synthesized nahl. interestingly, nahl production appears to be more common among plant-associated than among soilborne pseudomonas spp. indeed, 40% of the analyzed pseudomonas syringae strains produced nahl which were identified most often as the short-chain nahl, n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, n-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine  lactone, and n-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (no absolute correlation between genomospecies of p. syringae and their ability to produce nahl could be found). six strains of fluorescent pseudomonads, belonging to the species p. chlororaphis, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, isolated from the plant rhizosphere  produced different types of nahl. in contrast, none of the strains isolated from  soil samples were shown to produce nahl. the gene encoding the nahl synthase in p. syringae pv. maculicola was isolated by complementation of an nahl-deficient chromobacterium mutant. sequence analysis revealed the existence of a luxi homologue that we named psmi. this gene is sufficient to confer nahl synthesis upon its bacterial host and has strong homology to psyi and ahli, two genes involved in nahl production in p. syringae pv. tabaci and p. syringae pv. syringae, respectively. we identified another open reading frame that we termed psmr, transcribed convergently in relation to psmi and partly overlapping psmi; this gene encodes a putative luxr regulatory protein. this gene organization, with luxi and luxr homologues facing each other and overlapping, has been found so far only in the enteric bacteria erwinia and pantoea and in the related species p. syringae pv. tabaci.

AB  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus pseudomonas: was conducted by using the combined gyrb and rpod nucleotide sequences of 31 validly described species of pseudomonas: (a total of 125 strains). pseudomonas: strains diverged into two major clusters designated intrageneric cluster i (igc i) and intrageneric cluster ii (igc ii). igc i was further split into two subclusters, the 'p: aeruginosa complex', which included p: aeruginosa, p: alcaligenes, p: citronellolis, p: mendocina, p: oleovorans and p: pseudoalcaligenes, and the 'p: stutzeri complex', which included p: balearica and p: stutzeri. igc ii was further split into three  subclusters that were designated the 'p: putida complex', the 'p: syringae complex' and the 'p: fluorescens complex'. the 'p: putida complex' included p: putida and p: fulva. the 'p: syringae complex' was the cluster of phytopathogens  including p: amygdali, p: caricapapayae, p: cichorii, p: ficuserectae, p: viridiflava and the pathovars of p. savastanoi and p. syringae. the 'p. fluorescens complex' was further divided into two subpopulations, the 'p. fluorescens lineage' and the 'p. chlororaphis lineage'. the 'p. fluorescens lineage' contained p. fluorescens biotypes a, b and c, p. azotoformans, p. marginalis pathovars, p. mucidolens, p. synxantha and p. tolaasii, while the 'p.  chlororaphis lineage' included p. chlororaphis, p. agarici, p. asplenii, p. corrugata, p. fluorescens biotypes b and g and p. putida biovar b. the strains of p. fluorescens biotypes formed a polyphyletic group within the 'p. fluorescens complex'.

TI  == virulence of the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola is rpon dependent.
AB  == we cloned the rpon (ntra and glnf) gene encoding sigma(54) from the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola strain es4326. the p. syringae es4326 rpon gene complemented pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella aerogenes rpon mutants for a variety of rpon mutant phenotypes, including the inability to utilize nitrate as sole nitrogen source. dna sequence analysis of the p. syringae es4326 rpon gene revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence was most similar (86% identity; 95% similarity) to the sigma(54) protein encoded  by the pseudomonas putida rpon gene. a marker exchange protocol was used to construct an es4326 rpon insertional mutation, rpon::km(r). in contrast to wild-type es4326, es4326 rpon::km(r) was nonmotile and could not utilize nitrate, urea, c(4)-dicarboxylic acids, several amino acids, or concentrations of ammonia  below 2 mm as nitrogen sources. rpon was essential for production of the phytotoxin coronatine and for expression of the structural genes encoding coronamic acid. in addition, es4326 rpon::km(r) did not multiply or elicit disease symptoms when infiltrated into arabidopsis thaliana leaves, did not elicit the accumulation of several arabidopsis defense-related mrnas, and did not elicit a hypersensitive response (hr) when infiltrated into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) leaves. furthermore, whereas p. syringae es4326 carrying the avirulence  gene avrrpt2 elicited an hr when infiltrated into arabidopsis ecotype columbia leaves, es4326 rpon::km(r) carrying avrrpt2 elicited no response. constitutive expression of es4326 hrpl in es4326 rpon::km(r) partially restored defense-related mrna accumulation, showing a direct role for the hrp cluster in host defense gene induction in a compatible host-pathogen interaction. however, constitutive expression of hrpl in es4326 rpon::km(r) did not restore coronatine  production, showing that coronatine biosynthesis requires factors other than hrpl.

TI  == identification of ice-nucleating active pseudomonas fluorescens strains for biological control of overwintering colorado potato beetles (coleoptera: chrysomelidae).
AB  == laboratory studies were conducted to identify ice-nucleating active bacterial strains able to elevate the supercooling point, the temperature at which freezing is initiated in body fluids, of colorado potato beetles, leptinotarsa decemlineata (say), and to persist in their gut. adult beetles fed ice-nucleating active strains of pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, or p. syringae at 10(6) or  10(3) bacterial cells per beetle had significantly elevated supercooling points,  from -4.5 to -5.7 degrees c and from -5.2 to -6.6 degrees c, respectively, immediately after ingestion. in contrast, mean supercooling point of untreated control beetles was -9.2 degrees c. when sampled at 2 and 12 wk after ingestion,  only beetles fed p. fluorescens f26-4c and 88-335 still had significantly elevated supercooling points, indicating that these strains of bacteria were retained. furthermore, beetle supercooling points were comparable to those observed immediately after ingestion, suggesting that beetle gut conditions were  favorable not only for colonization but also for expression of ice-nucleating activity by these two strains. the results obtained from exposure to a single, low dose of either bacterial strain also show that a minimum amount of inoculum is sufficient for establishment of the bacterium in the gut. persistence of these bacteria in colorado potato beetles long after ingestion was also confirmed using a polymerase chain reaction technique that detected ice-nucleating active bacteria by virtue of their ina genes. application of these ice-nucleating active bacteria to elevate the supercooling point of this freeze-intolerant insect pest  could significantly reduce their winter survival, thereby reducing local populations and, consequently, crop damage.

TI  == thermoregulated expression and characterization of an nad(p)h-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase in the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea.
AB  == the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea pg4180.n9 causes  bacterial blight of soybeans and preferably infects its host plant during periods of cold, humid weather conditions. to identify proteins differentially expressed  at low temperatures, total cellular protein fractions derived from pg4180.n9 grown at 18 and 28 degreesc were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. of several proteins which appeared to be preferentially present  at 18 degreesc, a 40-kda protein with an isoelectric point of approximately 5 revealed significant n-terminal sequence homology to morphinone reductase (mr) of pseudomonas putida m10. the respective p. syringae gene was isolated from a genomic cosmid library of pg4180, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. it  was designated ncr for nad(p)h-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase. comparison of the 1,083-bp open reading frame with database entries revealed 48% identity and 52% similarity to the mr-encoding morb gene of p. putida m10. the ncr gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and its gene product was used to generate  polyclonal antisera. purified recombinant ncr protein was enzymatically characterized with nad(p)h and various morphinone analogs as substrates. so far,  only 2-cyclohexen-1-one and 3-penten-2-one were found to be substrates for ncr. by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, flavin mononucleotide could be identified as the noncovalently bound prosthetic group of this enzyme. the distribution of the ncr gene in different pseudomonas species and various strains of p. syringae was analyzed by pcr and southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the ncr gene is widespread among p. syringae pv. glycinea strains  but not in other pathovars of p. syringae or in any of the other pseudomonas strains tested.

TI  == histidine utilisation operon (hut) is upregulated at low temperature in the antarctic psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the antarctic psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae was mutagenised using a transposon tn5-ot182 which facilitates identification of promoter fusions expressing the reporter gene (lacz) for beta-galactosidase. most mutants expressed beta-galactosidase both at optimal growth temperature (20-22 degrees c) and at low temperature (4 degrees c). but a small percentage of the mutants (approximately 5%) were unique in that they expressed beta-galactosidase activity predominantly at low temperature. one such mutant was found to have an insertion  in the gene for urocanase (hutu) of the histidine utilisation (hut) operon. direct assay of urocanase and histidase activity in wild-type cells of various antarctic psychrotrophic strains including p. syringae, p. fluorescens and p. putida also suggested that the hut operon is expressed at an elevated level at low temperature.

TI  == differential induction of systemic resistance in arabidopsis by biocontrol bacteria.
AB  == selected nonpathogenic, root-colonizing bacteria are able to elicit induced systemic resistance (isr) in plants. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this type of systemic resistance, an arabidopsis-based model system was developed in which pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and fusarium oxysporum f.  sp. raphani were used as challenging pathogens. in arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes  columbia and landsberg erecta, colonization of the rhizosphere by p. fluorescens  strain wcs417r induced systemic resistance against both pathogens. in contrast, ecotype rld did not respond to wcs417r treatment, whereas all three ecotypes expressed systemic acquired resistance upon treatment with salicylic acid (sa). p. fluorescens strain wcs374r, previously shown to induce isr in radish, did not  elicit isr in arabidopsis. the opposite was found for p. putida strain wcs358r, which induced isr in arabidopsis but not in radish. these results demonstrate that rhizosphere pseudomonads are differentially active in eliciting isr in related plant species. the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (lps) of wcs417r is  the main isr-inducing determinant in radish and carnation, and lps-containing cell walls also elicit isr in arabidopsis. however, mutant wcs417roa-, lacking the o-antigenic side chain of the lps, induced levels of protection similar to those induced by wild-type wcs417r. this indicates that isr-inducing bacteria produce more than a single factor that trigger isr in arabidopsis. furthermore, wcs417r and wcs358r induced protection in both wild-type arabidopsis and sa-nonaccumulating nahg plants without activating pathogenesis-related gene expression. this suggests that elicitation of an sa-independent signaling pathway is a characteristic feature of isr-inducing biocontrol bacteria.

AB  == a xyle-icec transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga dna fragment harboring the cloned xyle structural gene from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned icec gene of pseudomonas syringae cit7. this fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae cit7 by homologous recombination. both cis-merodiploid strain cit7m17 and marker exchange strain cit7h69 produced the xyle gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. strain cit7m17, in which xyle was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pbr322, exhibited xyle activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) cit7m17 cells  in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in hplc measurements. the stability of xyle in both cit7m17 and cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xyle in several plasmid-borne constructs in p.aeruginosa, erwinia herbicola, and  escherichia coli. only the xyle-icec fusion in the chromosome of cit7h69 and cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. even though strain cit7h69 stably expressed xyle, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or hplc assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. however, expression of xylein cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xyle for use in autecological studies.

TI  == evidence that the hrpb gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB  == the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas solanacearum gmi1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. in this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpb) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpb encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpb has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the arac protein of escherichia coli, the xyls protein of pseudomonas putida and the virf protein of yersinia enterocolitica. the predicted hrpb gene product belongs to a family of bacterial  regulators different from the previously described hrps protein of the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpb gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. we also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpb is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.

TI  == multiple periplasmic catalases in phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae are exposed to plant-produced, detrimental levels of hydrogen peroxide during invasion and colonization of host  plant tissue. when p. syringae strains were investigated for their capacity to resist h2o2, they were found to contain 10- to 100-fold-higher levels of total catalase activity than selected strains belonging to nonpathogenic related taxa (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas putida) or escherichia coli. multiple catalase activities were identified in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fluids of exponential- and stationary-phase p. syringae cells. two of these activities were unique to the periplasm of p. syringae pv. glycinea. during the stationary growth phase, the specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased four- to eightfold. the specific activities of catalases in both fluids from exponential-phase cells increased in response to treatment with 0.25 to 10 mm h2o2 but decreased when higher h2o2 concentrations were used. in stationary-growth phase cultures, the specific activities of cytoplasmic catalases increased remarkably after treatment with 0.25 to 50 mm h2o2. the growth of p. syringae into stationary phase and h2o2 treatment did not induce synthesis of additional catalase isozymes. only the stationary-phase cultures of  all of the p. syringae strains which we tested were capable of surviving high h2o2 stress at concentrations up to 50 mm. our results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in the reduction of oxidative stress during plant pathogenesis by these bacteria.

TI  == accumulation of copper and other metals by copper-resistant plant-pathogenic and  saprophytic pseudomonads.
AB  == copper-resistant strains of pseudomonas syringae carrying the cop operon produce  periplasmic copper-binding proteins, and this sequestration outside the cytoplasm has been proposed as a resistance mechanism. in this study, strain ps61 of p. syringae carrying the cloned cop operon accumulated more total cellular copper than without the operon. several other copper-resistant pseudomonads with homology to cop were isolated from plants, and these bacteria also accumulated copper. two highly resistant species accumulated up to 115 to 120 mg of copper per g (dry weight) of cells. p. putida 08891 was more resistant to several metals than p. syringae pv. tomato pt23, but this increased resistance was not correlated with an increased accumulation of metals other than copper. several metals were accumulated by both pt23 and p. putida, but when copper was added to  induce the cop operon, there was generally no increase of accumulation of the other metals, suggesting that the cop operon does not contribute to accumulation  of these other metals. the exceptions were aluminum for pt23 and iron for p. putida, which accumulated to higher levels when copper was added to the cultures. the results of this study support the role of copper sequestration in the copper  resistance mechanism of p. syringae and suggest that this mechanism is common to  several copper-resistant pseudomonas species found on plants to which antimicrobial copper compounds are applied for plant disease control.

AB  == anaerobic growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa on nitrate or arginine requires the anr gene, which codes for a positive control element (anr) capable of functionally complementing an fnr mutation in escherichia coli. the anr gene was  sequenced; it showed 51% identity with the fnr gene at the amino acid sequence level. four cysteine residues known to be essential in the fnr protein are conserved in anr. the anr gene product (deduced mr 27,129) was visualized by the  maxicell method and migrated like a 32 kda protein in gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. an anr mutant of p. aeruginosa constructed by gene replacement was defective in nitrate respiration, arginine deiminase activity, and hydrogen cyanide biosynthesis, underscoring the diverse metabolic functions of anr during oxygen limitation. pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae, and pseudomonas mendocina all had a functional analogue of  anr, indicating that similar anaerobic control mechanisms exist in these bacteria.

TI  == broad host-range vector for efficient expression of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a broad host-range expression plasmid was constructed comprising the incq replicon, the reca promoter from escherichia coli and the g10-l ribosome binding  site (rbs) derived from bacteriophage t7. the structural genes for porcine somatotropin (pst) and e. coli beta-galactosidase (lacz) were used to monitor gene expression in a diverse collection of gram-negative bacterial hosts: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas testosteroni, serratia marcescens and erwinia herbicola. the e. coli reca promoter was functional in this wide range of hosts and was inducible by the addition of nalidixic acid. moreover, the level of lacz expression was often at least as high as that observed in e. coli.  previous studies had shown that the g10-l rbs was superior to a simple "consensus" rbs sequence for expression of foreign genes in e. coli. here we demonstrate a 38 to 70 fold increase in expression in two pseudomonas hosts using the g10-l rbs, indicating that the translational enhancer present in the g10-l rbs is also functional in other bacteria. the juxtaposition of these transcriptional and translational elements in a broad host-range vector provides  a simple way to evaluate alternate hosts for recombinant protein production.

TI  == a series of wide-host-range low-copy-number vectors that allow direct screening for recombinants.
AB  == a series of controlled expression vectors was constructed based on the wide-host-range plasmid pmmb66eh. some of these new vectors code for the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase and allow the direct screening of recombinant clones by inactivation of alpha-complementation. the bla gene was replaced in some plasmids by the cat gene of tn9 coding for chloramphenicol resistance, extending the use into beta-lactam-resistant strains. they all feature either the tac or taclac (tac-lac uv5 in tandem) promoters in front of a polylinker followed by the rrnb transcriptional stop point. these vectors were tested by subcloning the xyle gene coding for the pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-oxygenase and the escherichia coli lamb gene coding for the lambda receptor. the expression of these genes in e. coli indicated that the tac promoter is five times stronger than the taclac promoter and that both were tightly regulated. the tac promoter in pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea and xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria had a strength similar to that in e. coli, while the taclac promoter was much weaker, reaching only 6.5 and 3% of the level of expression of the tac promoter, respectively. the taclac promoter, however, proved to be useful for the cloning in e. coli of dna fragments that were unstable in vectors with stronger promoters and higher copy number. expression of the lamb gene in vibrio cholerae strain trh7000 was not sufficient to permit cosmid transduction. two subunits of the e.  coli mannose permease, coded by the ptsp and ptsm genes, are also required for cosmid dna penetration into the recipient cells.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression analysis of the anthranilate synthase gene of pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  == the trpe gene, which encodes the large component of the enzyme anthranilate synthase, was isolated from a pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi (p. savastanoi) cosmid library. cosmids that complemented an escherichia coli trpe mutation contained a gene whose product is 86% homologous at the deduced amino acid level to trpe of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. amino acid sequence comparison with other trpe sequences revealed the existence of conserved regions between the procaryotic and eucaryotic polypeptide sequences analyzed, regions that might be of functional importance. we also report on studies on the  expression pattern of this gene. we analyzed the promoter activity of a trpe::lacz transcriptional fusion, the relative amount of trpe steady-state mrna, and the activity of anthranilate synthase from cells grown in minimal medium with or without exogenously added tryptophan and in complete medium. we concluded that under the conditions tested, expression of the trpe gene of p. savastanoi is independent of the concentration of tryptophan in the culture medium. implications of such an expression pattern on the virulence of this bacterium are discussed.

TI  == formation of polyesters consisting of medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids from gluconate by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa pao and 15 other strains of this species synthesized a polyester with 3-hydroxydecanoate as the main constituent (55 to 76 mol%) if the  cells were cultivated in the presence of gluconate and if the nitrogen source was exhausted; 3-hydroxyhexanoate, 3-hydroxyoctanoate, and 3-hydroxydodecanoate were  minor constituents of the polymer. the polymer was deposited in granules within the cell and amounted to 70% of the cell dry matter in some strains. among 55 different strains of 41 pseudomonas species tested, p. aureofaciens (21.6% of cellular dry matter), p. citronellolis (78.0%), p. chlororaphis (8.5%), p. marginalis (11.4%), p. mendocina (50.7%), p. putida (33.5%), and pseudomonas sp.  strain dsm 1650 (54.6%) accumulated this type of polymer at significant levels (greater than 5%) during cultivation on gluconate. in two strains of p. facilis and p. fluorescens, as well as in one strain of p. syringae, this polymer was detected as a minor constituent (much less than 5%). all other strains accumulated either poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) or a polymer consisting mainly of 3-hydroxyoctanoate with octanoate but no polyester with gluconate as the carbon source. only a few species (e.g., p. stutzeri) were unable to accumulate poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) (pha) at all. these results indicated that the formation of pha depends on a pathway which is distinct from all other known pha-biosynthetic pathways. the polyesters accumulated by gluconate- or octanoate-grown cells of recombinant strains of p. aeruginosa and p. putida, which harbored the alcaligenes eutrophus poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)biosynthetic genes, contained 3-hydroxybutyrate as an additional constituent.

TI  == chromosome mapping in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain ps224.
AB  == a conjugation system for mapping the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae ps224 has been developed using the incp-10 plasmid r91-5; pmo22, a tn501-loaded derivative of r91-5; and pmo75, r91-5 loaded with tn5. nine different donor origins were identified with r91-5 and pmo22. by insertion of tn5 into various sites of the chromosome, an additional six donor origins were available using pmo75 as the donor plasmid. in all, 36 markers were located on three linkage groups. many donor strains were unstable and the limited availability of stable donor strains has limited the extent to which markers have been located. this instability of donor strains is in marked contrast to the highly stable donor strains found in p. putida using the same plasmids. as in p.  aeruginosa and p. putida, auxotrophic markers in p. syringae do not show the clustering of related markers found in enterobacteria.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of fluorescent pseudomonas associated with tomato roots.
AB  == the phenetic taxonomy of 110 fluorescent bacterial strains, isolated from the roots of tomatoes and other plants was numerically studied through 97 features including 69 assimilation tests. thirty-two reference strains of various pseudomonas spp. were additionally included. the strains clustered into 16 clusters at the 74% similarity level when using jaccard similarity coefficients.  almost all field strains belonged to the p. fluorescens/p. putida-complex while none clustered with p. syringae and allied bacteria. the biovar ii branch, as well as the newly described biovar vi of p. fluorescens, made up 55% and 20% respectively, of the field strains; two % were allocated to p. fluorescens biovar i and three % to biovar iv. eleven % of the root associated strains were designated p. putida; six strains were biovar a, three strains biovar b while four strains could not be referred to any known biovar. the continuum within the  p. fluorescens/p. putida-complex as well as the taxonomic status of the six biovars of p. fluorescens and the three biovars of p. putida are discussed.

TI  == copper resistance gene homologs in pathogenic and saprophytic bacterial species from tomato.
AB  == copper-resistant strains of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, pseudomonas cichorii, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens, and a yellow pseudomonas sp. were isolated from tomato plants or seeds. in southern hybridizations, dna from each strain showed homology with the copper resistance (cop) operon previously cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato pt23. homology was associated with plasmid and chromosomal dna in x. compestris pv. vesicatoria, p.  putida, and the yellow pseudomonas sp. homology was detected only in the chromosomal dna of p. cichorii and p. fluorescens. homology with cop was also detected in chromosomal dna from copper-sensitive strains of p. cichorii, p. fluorescens, and p. syringae pv. tomato, suggesting that the cop homolog may be indigenous to certain pseudomonas species and have some function other than copper resistance. no homology was detected in dna from a copper-sensitive x. campestris pv. vesicatoria strain. copper-inducible protein products were detected in each copper-resistant bacterium by immunoblot analysis with antibodies raised to the copb protein from the cop operon. the role of the homologous dna in copper resistance was confirmed for the x. campestris pv. vesicatoria strain by cloning and transferring the cop homolog to a copper-sensitive strain of x. campestris pv. vesicatoria. the possibility and implications of copper resistance gene exchange between different species and genera of pathogenic and saprophytic bacteria on tomato plants are discussed.

TI  == response of plant-colonizing pseudomonads to hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == colonization of plant root surfaces by pseudomonas putida may require mechanisms  that protect this bacterium against superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide produced by the root. catalase and superoxide dismutase may be important in this  bacterial defense system. stationary-phase cells of p. putida were not killed by  hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) at concentrations up to 10 mm, and extracts from these cells possessed three isozymic bands (a, b, and c) of catalase activity in  native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. logarithmic-phase cells exposed directly to hydrogen peroxide concentrations above 1 mm were killed. extracts of  logarithmic-phase cells displayed only band a catalase activity. protection against 5 mm h(2)o(2) was apparent after previous exposure of the logarithmic-phase cells to nonlethal concentrations (30 to 300 mum) of h(2)o(2).  extracts of these protected cells possessed enhanced catalase activity of band a  and small amounts of bands b and c. a single form of superoxide dismutase and isoforms of catalase were apparent in extracts from a foliar intercellular pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. the mobilities of these p. syringae enzymes were distinct from those of enzymes in p. putida extracts.

TI  == characterization of two surface-localized antigenic sites on porin protein f of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a rapid colony immunoblot screening procedure was used to demonstrate the surface localization of porin protein f on bacterial colonies of pseudomonas aeruginosa.  by this method, we demonstrated that protein f was accessible to four different specific monoclonal antibodies in a wide variety of both mucoid and nonmucoid p.  aeruginosa strains. controls were performed to demonstrate that, using this procedure, only surface-exposed epitopes bound monoclonal antibodies and that nonspecific binding of monoclonal antibodies either to cells lacking protein f or to mucoid exopolysaccharide did not occur. monoclonal antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10, specific for protein f, also interacted with colonies of pseudomonas  putida and pseudomonas syringae, whereas the protein f specific monoclonal antibody ma5-8 interacted only with p. aeruginosa strains. using the above-named  monoclonal antibodies, we investigated the antigenic structure of protein f. monoclonal antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10 bound to 29-31 kilodalton proteolytic fragments produced after papain or trypsin digestion of purified protein f or of protein f in outer membranes or intact cells. antibody ma5-8 did  not interact with proteolytically digested protein f but did interact with two of the six fragments produced after partial cyanogen bromide cleavage of protein f.  antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10 did not interact with protein f after reduction of its internal disulphide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol; in contrast, the reactivity of ma5-8 was unaffected. this data suggests that there are at least two distinct highly conserved surface epitopes on porin protein f.

TI  == cloning vectors derived from the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1.
AB  == the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1, which has about seven copies, was reduced to a minimal replicon and used to construct stable gene-cloning vehicles. the host for all cloning experiments was p. aeruginosa strain pao. two nonmobilizable plasmids, pme260 and pme290, and one rp1-mobilizable plasmid, pme285, were constructed. the vectors pme260 (6.3 kb) and pme290 (6.8 kb) carry the tn801 bla  gene specifying carbenicillin (cb) resistance, a good selective marker in pseudomonas, and the tn903 aph gene encoding kanamycin (km) resistance, with useful restriction sites for insertional inactivation. the mob+ vector pme285 (10.6 kb) carries the aph gene and the tn501-derived merrtca genes coding for mercuric ion resistance, another good selective marker in pseudomonas. the hypothetical merd gene, which may follow the mera gene in tn501 but is absent from pme285, appeared to be dispensable for mercuric ion resistance in p. aeruginosa. the mob- vector pme290 could be introduced by transformation and maintained in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. acidovorans, p. stutzeri, p. mendocina, p. cepacia, and p. syringae. the plasmid  was compatible with incp-1 and incp-4 replicons.

TI  == differences between lipopolysaccharide compositions of plant pathogenic and saprophytic pseudomonas species.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) were obtained by washing cells of plant pathogenic and  saprophytic pseudomonas species with saline (fraction 1) and then with saline-edta (fraction 2). the cells subsequently were extracted with phenol to yield a third aqueous preparation (fraction 3). each fraction type contained the  lps components, lipid a, heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar, and neutral and amino sugars. the neutral sugar compositions of fractions 1, 2, and 3, although similar within a species, differed between the pseudomonas species. the lps of two pathovars (pv.) of pseudomonas syringae had glucose and rhamnose as major components: 13 (+/-3)% glucose and 87 (+/-3)% rhamnose for p. syringae pv. pisi and 18 (+/-5)% glucose and 76 (+/-2)% rhamnose for p. syringae pv. syringae. fucose was present in addition to glucose and rhamnose for p. syringae pv. phaseolicola (68 [+/-8]% rhamnose, 14 [+/-1]% fucose, and 14 [+/-5]% glucose) and p. syringae pv. tabaci (24 [+/-2]% rhamnose, 54 [+/-3]% fucose, and 17 [+/-1]% glucose). the lps from different races of p. syringae pv. pisi and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola could not be distinguished by neutral sugar composition. three saprophytic species, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, also produced  lps which had different proportions of rhamnose, fucose, and glucose. the lps from three isolates of p. putida were distinct in possessing a high proportion of amino sugar and containing glucose as the major neutral sugar component (86 to 100%). the lps fractions from plant pathogenic and saprophytic pseudomonas species did not elicit browning or phytoalexin production in treated dark red kidney bean cotyledons or red mexican bean leaves. rather, chlorosis of the lps-treated leaf tissue was observed.

TI  == genetic and molecular characterization of the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1.
AB  == a restriction map of the 30-kb nonconjugative pseudomonas plasmid pvs1 was constructed. derivatives of pvs1 obtained in vitro by successive deletions were used to localize on the physical map the determinant for resistance to mercuric ions (carried by transposon tn501), the gene(s) encoding sulfonamide resistance,  a 1.6-kb region affecting plasmid stability and establishment in p. fluorescens atcc 13525, and a segment required for mobilization of pvs1 by plasmid rp1. the sulfonamide resistance determinant of pvs1 appeared to be closely related to that of transposon tn21. a mini-pvs1 replicon, pme259, consisting of an essential 1.55-kb segment (designated rep and thought to carry the origin of replication) and a mercury resistance determinant was able to replicate p. aeruginosa pao but  selective pressure was needed for plasmid maintenance. the copy number of pvs1 derivatives was estimated to be 6-8 per chromosome equivalent. plasmids possessing the essential rep segment plus the adjacent stability region could be  established in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens, p. acidovorans, p. cepacia, p. mendocina, p. stutzeri, p. syringae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and rhizobium leguminosarum.

TI  == pseudomonas stutzeri and related species undergo natural transformation.
AB  == cells of pseudomonas stutzeri are naturally transformed by homologous chromosomal dna; they do not require chemical treatment to become competent. this capacity to undergo natural transformation was found to be shared by the closely related species p. mendocina, p. alcaligenes, and p. pseudoalcaligenes, but was not detectable in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. perfectomarinus, p. putida, p. fluorescens, or p. syringae. p. stutzeri could be transformed either on plates or in liquid medium. only double-stranded chromosomal dna was effective; single-stranded dna and plasmid dna were not. dna fragments larger than 10 kilobase pairs were more effective than smaller fragments. the transformation frequency was proportional to dna concentration from 1 ng/ml to 1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations were saturating. the maximum frequency, about 10(-4) transformants per recipient cell, was obtained with cells from a culture in the early stationary growth phase. a variety of chromosomal mutations have been transformed, including mutations to auxotrophy and to antibiotic resistance. other systems for genetic exchange in p. stutzeri have not yet been found; transformation offers a means for the genetic analysis of this metabolically versatile organism.
