in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
geldanamycin treatment ameliorates the response to lps in murine macrophages by decreasing cd14 surface expression.
geldanamycin (ga) is an antibiotic produced by actinomyces, which specifically inhibits the function of the heat shock protein 90 family. treatment of a murine macrophage cell line (j774) with ga resulted in a reduced response to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) as visualized by a decrease of nf-kappab translocation into the nucleus and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). to elucidate the mechanism of this effect, the expression of cd14, the formal lps receptor, was analyzed. cells treated with ga showed a reduced level of surface cd14 detected by immunostaining, whereas the expression of other surface receptors, such as fc-gamma receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptors (tnf-r1 and tnf-r2), was unaffected. the reduced surface level of cd14 was not due to a reduction in its expression because cd14 steady state mrna levels or the total cellular pool of cd14 was not altered by ga treatment. surface cd14 was more rapidly internalized after ga treatment (2-3 h) than after incubation with cycloheximide. immunostaining of permeabilized cells after ga treatment revealed a higher intracellular content of cd14 colocalizing with calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum (er) protein. these results suggest that the decrease in cd14 surface expression after ga treatment is due to rapid internalization without new replacement. these effects may be due to the inhibition of hsp90 and grp94 by ga in macrophages.
lectin-dependent attachment of actinomyces naeslundii to receptors on epithelial  cells.
the adherence of actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 to monolayer cultures of human epithelial cell lines was mediated by the lactose-sensitive fimbriae (type 2) of strain wvu45. the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v, which has both types 1 and 2 fimbriae, was approximately half that of a. naeslundii, and only minimal attachment of a. naeslundii and a. viscosus mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae was detected. the adherence of strain wvu45 was enhanced two- to threefold by neuraminidase treatment of the epithelial cells. the fab fragments of antibodies which recognize the type 2 fimbriae inhibited the adherence of a. naeslundii wvu45 to the epithelial cells. the bacterial interaction with epithelial cells was inhibited by lactose, methyl-beta-d-galactoside, and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, but not by methyl-alpha-d-galactoside, cellobiose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-fucose, or d-mannose. to further characterize the epithelial cell receptors for the bacterial lectin, we utilized several plant and invertebrate lectins as potential inhibitors of bacterial adherence. lectins from bauhinia purpurea and arachis hypogaea which recognize n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, d-galactose, and d-galactose-beta-(1----3)-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine inhibited bacterial attachment, and binding of these lectins to epithelial cells was enhanced by the addition of neuraminidase. lectins reacting with alpha-linked d-galactose, alpha-linked n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, d-mannose, or sialic acid were not inhibitory. under similar assay conditions, adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of escherichia coli was inhibited by concanavalin a but not by the lectin from bauhinia purpurea. these results indicate that certain plant lectins have specificities similar to that of the actinomyces fimbrial lectin and are, therefore, useful probes for identifying receptors on epithelial cells for certain bacteria.
