TI  == ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model.
AB  == anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. the broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. we compared  the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (cpa) to that of ertapenem (ert) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fcmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fcmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fcmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain of prevotella bivia, and  one strain of finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro pk/pd model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 cfu/ml. bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 cfu/ml from the starting inoculum. both cpa and ert were bactericidal against all four strains. cpa demonstrated improved activity against bacteroides strains compared to that of ert but had similar activity against finegoldia magna and p. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with cpa against p. bivia. no resistance emerged from any of the models. the pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. cpa has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.
