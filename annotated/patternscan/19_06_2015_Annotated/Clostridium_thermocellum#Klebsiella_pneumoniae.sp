TI  == influences of ph and hydraulic retention time on anaerobes converting beer processing wastes into hydrogen.
AB  == to convert high-solids organic wastes (3% w./w.) to high-value hydrogen, a full factorial experimental design was employed in planning the experiments for learning the effects of ph and hydraulic retention time (hrt) on the hydrogen production in a chemostat reactor using waste yeast obtained from beer processing wastes. for determining which experimental variable settings affect hydrogen production, predictive polynomial quadratic equation and response surface methodology were employed to determine and explain the conditions required for high-value hydrogen production. experimental results indicate that a maximum hydrogen production rate of 460 ml/gvss/d was obtained at ph = 5.8 and hrt = 32 hours. moreover, hydrogenase targeted rt-pcr results indicate that clostridium thermocellum and klebsiella pneumoniae predominated.

TI  == [cloning and expression of clostridium thermocellum f7 endoglucanase gene in gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the endoglucanase gene of clostridium thermocellum f7 was cloned in escherichia coli cells using pkm4 vector. both the physical mapping and analysis of the gene  products in the e. coli mini-cells system suggest cloning of a new cel gene different from those described earlier. the activity of endoglucanase in e. coli  cells is localized in the periplasm, which correlates with secretion of enzymes of this type in c. thermicellum. apart from 2 major components with mr 42.5 and 43 kda, corresponding to mature protein forms, we observed the formation of minor products of various electrophoretic motilities. cloning of the endoglucanase gene on bhr vector pbs954 controlled by its own regulatory signal yielded high level of the endoglucanase activity in the recombinant strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and erwinia carotovora comparable with the level  of the gene expression in e. coli cells.
