TI  == shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. this internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (hfs) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of western societies. the aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male wistar rats fed a hfs diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. for this purpose, dna extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. short-chain fatty  acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. at the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria) and class level (erisypelotrichi, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidia and bacilli). interestingly, the class clostridia showed a significant decrease after hfs diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. of particular interest, clostridium cluster xiva species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (mitsuokella jalaludinii, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridium sp. fcb90-3, prevotella nanceiensis, clostridium fusiformis, clostridium sp. bnl1100 and eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. these results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able  to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
