TI  - Ruminococcus faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Bacterial strain Eg2(T), an anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-motile, and non-spore-forming coccus, was isolated from human faeces. The optimal temperature for its growth was 37 degrees C. Oxidase activity was negative, but catalase activity was positive. The strain was able to hydrolyze esculin and to produce acids from the fermentation of several substrates, including glucose. Lactic and acetic acids were the main products of glucose fermentation. The major fatty acids present in this strain were C(16:0), C(14:0), and C(18:1) cis11 DMA. The G+C content was 43.4 mol%. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain Eg2(T) was closely related to species of the genus Ruminococcus (96.3% similarity to R. torques and 96.2% similarity to R. lactaris), and its taxonomic position was placed within the Clostridium cluster XIVa. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic, and phylogenetic evidence, we propose that this novel strain be assigned to the genus Ruminococcus and be named Ruminococcus faecis sp. nov. The type strain is Eg2(T) (=KCTC 5757(T) =JCM 15917(T)).
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
