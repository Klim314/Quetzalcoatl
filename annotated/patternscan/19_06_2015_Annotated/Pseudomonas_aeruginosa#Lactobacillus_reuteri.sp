TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different lactobacillus species against multi- drug resistant clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are the well known friendly bacteria for their probiotic activities against pathogens. the inhibitory activity of different strains of lactobacilli either obtained as commercial products or isolated from human feces  was investigated against the clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the isolates were selected as the most resistant strains when challenged with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics already in clinical practice. materials and methods: both the plate spot test as well as the agar cup method were used for screening of lactobacillus strains against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: a lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from feces of an iranian child showed a strong anti-pseudomonal activity (90 percent after 72h incubation) against the multi-drug resistant clinical isolates while a lactobacillus reuteri strain isolated from a commercial oral product resulted in relatively weak response and  a lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from a commercial vaginal product did not show any inhibitory activity. in a kinetic study the lactobacillus sensitive  pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a significant bacteriostatic activity in vitro in the presence of lactobacillus supernatants. conclusion: some lactobacilli exhibit significant inhibitory activity against the multidrug resistant clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == identification and biological activity of potential probiotic bacterium isolated  from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium e isolated from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb was identified by sequencing of 16s rdna fragment and species-specific pcr as lactobacillus reuteri. its potential antimicrobial activity and ability to modulate immune system in vitro and in vivo was determined. the growth inhibition of potential pathogens decreased from staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica ser. minnesota to escherichia coli. the lowest inhibition activity was observed in the case of candida albicans. the ability of  l. reuteri e to modulate biological activities of human and mouse mononuclear cells was estimated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. the production of il-1beta by monocytes in vitro was significantly induced by l. reuteri e (relative activity 2.47). the ability to modulate biological activities of mononuclear cells by living l. reuteri e cells in vitro in comparison to disintegrated l. reuteri e cells in vivo differed. for example lysozyme activity  in vitro was inhibited while in vivo was stimulated (relative activities 0.30 and 1.83, respectively). the peroxidase activity in vitro was stimulated while in vivo was inhibited (relative activities 1.53 and 0.17, respectively). obtained results indicate that l. reuteri e is potential candidate to be used in probiotic preparations for animals and/or human.

TI  == expression of integrins and toll-like receptors in cervical cancer: effect of infectious agents.
AB  == we hypothesized that development of cervical cancer is associated with alterations in the expression of innate immune receptors, i.e. integrins and tlrs, and that these alterations can be induced by infectious agents. we have studied the expression of these proteins in cervical biopsy tissues and cervical  cancer-derived cell lines hela, caski, siha, c-33 a, and me180. immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated an increase in integrin alphav, beta3, beta4, and beta6 expression in the epithelium during the development of cervical  cancer. a clear trend towards higher expression of integrin beta6 in cell lines harbouring human papillomavirus (hpv) genetic material, compared to hpv-negative  c-33 a, was observed. to investigate whether bacterial infection can alter the expression of tlrs and integrins, we infected hela cells by two pathogens, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, using a common bacterium of the female genital tract, lactobacillus reuteri, as a control. infection with e. coli or p. aeruginosa, but not with l. reuteri, significantly altered the expression of tlr and integrins, particularly of tlr4 and integrin beta6. considering that both integrin beta6 and tlr4 play important roles in tumorigenesis, our data suggest that bacterial infection may trigger cancer development in hpv-infected cervical epithelium.

TI  == natural antimicrobial agent (reuterin) produced by lactobacillus reuteri for sanitization of biological tissues inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the study was done to evaluate the efficacy of using reuterin produced by lactobacillus reuteri to sanitize biological tissues. the microorganism tested in the study was pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of nosocomial biomaterial-related infections. the inhibitory effect of reuterin on p. aeruginosa for an inoculated tissue was investigated at different conditions of concentration, temperature, and ph. additionally, the cellular compatibility of the reuterin-sanitized tissue was evaluated. glutaraldehyde was employed as a control. it was noted that the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic, 33.0 +/- 2.9 ppm) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc, 50.0 +/- 0.0 ppm) values of reuterin for p. aeruginosa were significantly lower than their glutaraldehyde counterparts (mic, 130.0 +/- 8.2 ppm and mbc, 180.0 +/- 18.3 ppm). this indicated that reuterin was more efficient than glutaraldehyde as an antimicrobial agent. the addition of reuterin on the inoculated tissue led to a reduced viability of p. aeruginosa. the reduction in the p. aeruginosa culture was more pronounced with increasing the concentration of reuterin (0-100 ppm). at increasing temperature (25-45 degrees c), there was an increasing effect of reuterin on its  sanitization activity. however, it should be pointed out that the growth of p. aeruginosa in the nutrient broth was also significantly affected by temperature.  the sanitization activity of reuterin was more evident with increasing the ph level (ph 6.5-8.5). the cytotoxicity of reuterin was significantly lower than that of glutaraldehyde. additionally, the cellular compatibility of the reuterin-sanitized tissue was superior to its glutaraldehyde-sanitized counterpart.
