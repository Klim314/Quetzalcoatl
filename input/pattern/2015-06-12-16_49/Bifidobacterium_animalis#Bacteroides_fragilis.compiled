TI  - The beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The structure of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. RESULTS: The strain named Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield was selected to study the effect of its EPS on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. The results indicated that EPS significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that the EPS significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. When receiving a low dose of EPS, Bacteroidales sp./Lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and L. johnsonii, L. animalis and L. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a high concentration of EPS. CONCLUSION: The combination of viable cell count, DGGE and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of EPS from B. bifidum WBIN03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health of their hosts.
TI  - Intestinal Bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  - AIMS: To characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. METHODS: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease, 12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations were analysed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis/Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). Bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). Bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). Bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. A higher LAB diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. Weissella spp and Lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and LAB populations in the duodenum of Spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
