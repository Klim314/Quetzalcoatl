TI  - Cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  - Dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. The origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. This study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. Vertebrate-type rather than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. Dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. Dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. Latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kD chymotrypsin-like proteinase from Treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin G but not by human plasmin. Incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium saburreum, Prevotella buccae and Porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. Doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an IC50-value of 20 microM. Dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type I and II collagens than type III collagen. Western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kD proform to a 58 kD active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. This reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as T. denticola or other PMN proteases such as cathepsin G.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  - Activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type I collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kDa trypsinlike protease from Porphyromas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), a 95-kDa chymotrypsinlike protease from Treponema denticola (ATCC 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. The bacteria included were Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25261), Prevotella buccae (ES 57), Prevotella oris (ATCC 33573), Porphyromonas endodontalis (ES 54b), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 295222), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Mitsuokella dentalis (DSM 3688), and Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 15909). None of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. The fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. The proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of TIMP-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. None of the studied bacteria, proteases from P. gingivalis and T. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. However, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. Our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. Thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal tissue destruction.
