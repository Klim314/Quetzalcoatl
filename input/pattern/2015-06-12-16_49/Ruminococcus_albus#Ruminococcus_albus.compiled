TI  - Screening currency notes for microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes  using a shotgun metagenomic approach.
AB  - Fomites are a well-known source of microbial infections and previous studies have provided insights into the sojourning microbiome of fomites from various sources. Paper currency notes are one of the most commonly exchanged objects and its potential to transmit pathogenic organisms has been well recognized. Approaches to identify the microbiome associated with paper currency notes have been largely limited to culture dependent approaches. Subsequent studies portrayed the use of 16S ribosomal RNA based approaches which provided insights into the taxonomical distribution of the microbiome. However, recent techniques including shotgun sequencing provides resolution at gene level and enable estimation of their copy numbers in the metagenome. We investigated the microbiome of Indian paper currency notes using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. Metagenomic DNA isolated from samples of frequently circulated denominations of Indian currency notes were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencer. Analysis of the data revealed presence of species belonging to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genera. The taxonomic distribution at kingdom level revealed contigs mapping to eukaryota (70%), bacteria (9%), viruses and archae (~1%). We identified 78 pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and 75 cellulose degrading organisms including Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Cellulomonas flavigena and Ruminococcus albus. Additionally, 78 antibiotic resistance genes were identified and 18 of these were found in all the samples. Furthermore, six out of 78 pathogens harbored at least one of the 18 common antibiotic resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun metagenome sequence dataset of paper currency notes, which can be useful for future applications including as bio-surveillance of exchangeable fomites for infectious agents.
TI  - Characterization of the cellulolytic bacteria communities along the gastrointestinal tract of Chinese Mongolian sheep by using PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR analysis.
AB  - A balanced gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem is crucial for the health and growth of animals. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of ruminants, cellulolytic bacteria aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Rumen contents and feces in ruminants are often used to assess gastrointestinal microbial communities; however, these sites do not guarantee to represent the diversity of microbes found in the entire GIT. In this study, we investigated the microbiota along the GIT of five Chinese Mongolian sheep using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR analysis. Results indicated that microbiota were more abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. DGGE and real-time PCR revealed the predominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the GIT. Meanwhile, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium cluster IV showed significant difference in their abundance along the GIT (P < 0.05). Fibrobacter succinogenes was the most dominant species, followed by Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. The ileum harbored a larger number of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly-Clostridium cluster IV, than reported previously. In addition, comparisons between microbiota in the rumen and rectum indicated similar number of total bacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, F. succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Clostridium cluster IV, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, whereas the number of R. albus and R. flavefaciens was higher in the rumen. This study investigated the composition and quantification of GIT microbial community in Chinese Mongolian sheep, and revealed for the first time the cellulolytic bacterial community in these sheep.
TI  - Effects of garlic oil, nitrate, saponin and their combinations supplemented to different substrates on in vitro fermentation, ruminal methanogenesis, and abundance and diversity of microbial populations.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of garlic oil (G), nitrate (N), saponin (S) and their combinations supplemented to different forage to concentrate substrates on methanogenesis, fermentation, diversity and abundances of bacteria and Archaea in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in an 8 x 2 factorial design with eight treatments and two substrates using mixed ruminal batch cultures obtained. Quillaja S (0.6 g l-1 ), N (5 mmol l-1 ) and G (0.27 g l-1 ) were used separately or in binary and tertiary combinations. The two substrates contained grass hay and a dairy concentrate mixture at a 70 : 30 (high-forage substrate) ratio or a 30 : 70 (high-concentrate substrate) ratio. Ruminal fermentation and cellulolytic bacterial populations were affected by interaction between substrate and anti-methanogenic compounds. The inhibitor combinations decreased the methane production additively regardless of substrate. For the high-concentrate substrate, S decreased methane production to a greater extent, so did G and N individually for the high-forage substrate. Feed degradability and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were not decreased by any of the treatments. Fibre degradability was actually improved by N+S for the high-forage substrate. VFA concentrations and profiles were affected differently by different anti-methanogenic inhibitors and their combinations. All treatments inhibited the growth of Archaea, but the effect on Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens varied. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that substrate influences the efficacy of these inhibitors when they are used separately, but in combinations, they can lower methanogenesis additively without much influence from the substrate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presented research provided evidence that binary and tertiary combination of garlic oil, nitrate and saponin can lower the methane production additively without adversely impacting rumen fermentation and degradability, and forage to concentrate ratio does not change the above effects. These anti-methanogenic inhibitors in combination may have practical application to mitigate methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Functional phylotyping approach for assessing intraspecific diversity of Ruminococcus albus within the rumen microbiome.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic bacterium, is a critical member of the rumen community. Ruminococcus albus lacks a classical cellulosome complex, but it possesses a unique family 37 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM37), which is integrated into a variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes. We developed a potential molecular tool for functional phylotyping of the R. albus population in the rumen, based on a variable region in the cel48A gene. cel48A encodes a single copy of the CBM37-associated family 48 glycoside hydrolase in all known strains of this bacterium. A segment of the cel48A gene was amplified from rumen metagenomic samples of four bovines, and its abundance and diversity were evaluated. Analysis of the obtained sequences revealed the co-existence of multiple functional phylotypes of cel48A in all four animals. These included sequences identical or similar to those of R. albus isolates (reference strains), as well as several novel sequences. The dominant cel48A type varied among animals. This method can be used for detection of intraspecific diversity of R. albus in metagenomic samples. Together with scaC, a previously reported gene marker for R. flavefaciens, we present a set of two species-specific markers for phylotyping of Ruminococci in the herbivore rumen.
TI  - Study of rumen metagenome community using qPCR under different diets.
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect the major bacteria present in rumen microbiota. Here, we performed qPCR based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to roughage diets. Animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 100:00 (T1), 75:25 (T2), 50:50 (T3) and 25:75 (T4) respectively for 30 days. At the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h and 2 h after feeding. It was found that among fibrolytic bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.22 x 10(8) copies/ml) were highest in T2 group and followed by 1.11 x 10(8) copies/ml for Fibrobacter succinogenes (T2), 2.56 x 10(7) copies/ml for Prevotella ruminicola (T1) and 1.25 x 10(7) copies/ml for Ruminococcus albus (T4). In non-fibrolytic bacteria, the Selenomonas ruminantium (2.62 x 10(7) copies/ml) was predominant in group T3 and followed by Treponema bryantii (2.52 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group T1, Ruminobacter amylophilus (1.31 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group T1 and Anaerovibrio lipolytica (2.58 x 10(6) copies/ml) in group T4. It is most notable that R. flavefaciens were the highest in population in the rumen of Surti buffalo fed wheat straw as roughage source.
TI  - Potential of tannin-rich plants for modulating ruminal microbes and ruminal fermentation in sheep.
AB  - The objective of this work was to study nutritional strategies for decreasing methane production by ruminants fed tropical diets, combining in vitro and in vivo methods. The in vitro approach was used to evaluate the dose effect of condensed tannins (CT) contained in leaves of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Manihot esculenta (39, 75, and 92 g CT/kg DM, respectively) on methane production and ruminal fermentation characteristics. Tannin-rich plants (TRP) were incubated for 24 h alone or mixed with a natural grassland hay based on Dichanthium spp. (control plant), so that proportions of TRP were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Methane production, VFA concentration, and fermented OM decreased with increased proportions of TRP. Numerical differences on methane production and VFA concentration among TRP sources may be due to differences in their CT content, with greater effects for L. leucocephala and M. esculenta than for G. sepium. Independently of TRP, the response to increasing doses of CT was linear for methane production but quadratic for VFA concentration. As a result, at moderate tannin dose, methane decreased more than VFA. The in vivo trial was conducted to investigate the effect of TRP on different ruminal microbial populations. To this end, 8 rumen-cannulated sheep from 2 breeds (Texel and Blackbelly) were used in two 4 x 4 Latin square designs. Diets were fed ad libitum and were composed of the same feeds used for the in vitro trial: control plant alone or combined with pellets made from TRP leaves at 44% of the diet DM. Compared to TRP, concentration of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was greater for the control diet and concentration of Ruminococcus albus was least for the control diet. The methanogen population was greater for Texel than for Blackbelly. By contrast, TRP-containing diets did not affect protozoa or Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers. Hence, TRP showed potential for mitigating methane production by ruminants. These findings suggest that TRP fed as pellets could be used to decrease methane production.
TI  - Unique aspects of fiber degradation by the ruminal ethanologen Ruminococcus albus 7 revealed by physiological and transcriptomic analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria in the genus Ruminococcus are ubiquitous members of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. In particular, they are important in ruminants where they digest a wide range of plant cell wall polysaccharides. For example, Ruminococcus albus 7 is a primary cellulose degrader that produces acetate usable by its bovine host. Moreover, it is one of the few organisms that ferments cellulose to form ethanol at mesophilic temperatures in vitro. The mechanism of cellulose degradation by R. albus 7 is not well-defined and is thought to involve pilin-like proteins, unique carbohydrate-binding domains, a glycocalyx, and cellulosomes. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics, fermentation analyses, and transcriptomics to further clarify the cellulolytic and fermentative potential of R. albus 7. RESULTS: A comparison of the R. albus 7 genome sequence against the genome sequences of related bacteria that either encode or do not encode cellulosomes revealed that R. albus 7 does not encode for most canonical cellulosomal components. Fermentation analysis of R. albus 7 revealed the ability to produce ethanol and acetate on a wide range of fibrous substrates in vitro. Global transcriptomic analysis of R. albus 7 grown at identical dilution rates on cellulose and cellobiose in a chemostat showed that this bacterium, when growing on cellulose, utilizes a carbohydrate-degrading strategy that involves increased transcription of the rare carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 37 domain and the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that R. albus 7 does not use canonical cellulosomal components to degrade cellulose, but rather up-regulates the expression of CBM37-containing enzymes and tryptophan biosynthesis. This study contributes to a revised model of carbohydrate degradation by this key member of the rumen ecosystem.
TI  - Effect of fiber digestibility and conservation method on feed intake and the ruminal ecosystem of growing steers.
AB  - Fiber digestibility is an important factor regulating DMI in ruminants. Additionally, the ensiling process can also affect digestibility and chemical composition of the forage. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of sugarcane NDF digestibility (NDFD) and conservation method on intake, rumen kinetics, and the ruminal ecosystem of steers. Eight ruminally cannulated Nellore steers (275+/-22 kg BW) were used in a replicated 4x4 Latin square design with a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Two sugarcane genotypes divergent for stalk NDFD were used: IAC86-2480 with high NDFD and SP91-1049 with low NDFD. Experimental diets were formulated with 40% sugarcane, either freshly cut or as silage, and 60% concentrate on a DM basis. Each experimental period lasted for 14 d, with the last 4 d used for determination of intake, ruminal evacuation, and ruminal fluid collection. The effect of fiber digestibility on DM and NDF intake was dependent on the forage conservation method (P=0.01). High NDFD increased (P<0.01) DMI only when sugarcane was offered as silage, having no effect (P=0.41) on DMI when offered as freshly cut. Conservation method had no effect on total ruminal mass, with only a tendency (P<0.10) for greater NDF and indigestible NDF ruminal mass in steers fed the low-NDFD genotype. The NDF turnover and passage rates were greater (P<0.05) for the genotype with high NDFD but only when offered as silage. Liquid turnover rate in the rumen was greater (P=0.02) for diets containing silage, with no effect of genotype (P=0.87). There was no effect of NDFD genotype on ruminal pH (P=0.77); however, diets containing sugarcane as silage increased (P<0.01) ruminal pH. Total concentration of short chain fatty acids (P=0.05) and proportions of propionate (P=0.01) were greater for diets containing fresh sugarcane. Diets with fresh sugarcane increased the ruminal population of Streptococcus bovis (P<0.01) and Ruminococcus albus (P=0.03). The relative population of R. albus was also greater (P=0.04) for diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high NDFD. Feeding diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high NDFD increased Fibrobacter succinogenes population but only when sugarcane was fed as freshly cut (P=0.02). Using sugarcane genotypes with high NDFD can increase intake and benefit fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen.
TI  - Effect of yeast with bacteriocin from rumen bacteria on laying performance, blood biochemistry, faecal microbiota and egg quality of laying hens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of yeast with bacteriocin from Ruminococcus albus 7 (albusin B) on physiological state and production performance of laying hens. One hundred and twenty 26-week-old Single Comb White Leghorn (Hyline) laying hens were assigned into five groups including: (i) control group, (ii) yeast control (YC), (iii) 0.125% yeast with bacteriocin (0.125B), (iv) 0.25% yeast with bacteriocin (0.25B) and (v) 0.5% yeast with bacteriocin (0.5B). All supplements were added to the experimental diets of the hens from 26 to 46 weeks of age. Samples were collected every 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected from the wing vein for blood biochemical parameters assay, and faecal samples were collected by swab for the microbiota test. The egg production performance was recorded daily, and fresh eggs were collected for quality test. The blood biochemical assay results indicated that the addition of yeast with bacteriocin decreased the AST (aspartate aminotransferase) activity and it also affects the lactate concentration in laying hen blood. The result of egg quality indicated that yeast with bacteriocin supplementation had no effect on the mass of yolk and the strength of eggshell, but it had positive effect on the laying performance under hot environment. Low concentration bacteriocin (0.125B) supplementation could decrease total yolk cholesterol. The faecal microbiota result indicated that the supplementation of bacteriocin increased the lactobacilli counts. The yeast with bacteriocin supplementation significantly decreased the clostridia counts under hot environment condition, especially in hens receiving 0.25B. Combining the data from clinic chemistry, faecal microbiota, egg production and egg quality, the 0.25B supplementation may result in the best physiological parameter and egg production performance of laying hen.
TI  - Effect of dietary supplementation with resveratrol on nutrient digestibility, methanogenesis and ruminal microbial flora in sheep.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on methanogenesis and microbial flora in Dorper x thin-tailed Han cross-bred ewes. In experiment 1, ten ewes (67.2 +/- 2.24 kg BW) were assigned to two dietary treatments, a basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with resveratrol (0.25 g/head.day), to investigate the effect of resveratrol on nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance. In experiment 2, six ewes (64.0 +/- 1.85 kg BW) with ruminal cannulae were assigned to the identical dietary treatments used in experiment 1 to investigate supplementary resveratrol on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora using qPCR. The results showed that supplementary resveratrol improved the digestibility of organic matter (OM; p < 0.001), nitrogen (N; p = 0.007), neutral detergent fibre (NDF; p < 0.001) and acid detergent fibre (ADF; p < 0.001). The excretion of faecal N was reduced (p = 0.007), whereas that of urinary N increased (p = 0.002), which led to an unchanged N retention (p = 0.157). Both CO2 and CH4 output scaled to digestible dry matter (DM) intake decreased from 602.5 to 518.7 (p = 0.039) and 68.2 to 56.6 (p < 0.001) respectively. Ruminal pH (p = 0.341), ammonia (p = 0.512) and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) (p = 0.249) were unaffected by resveratrol. The molar proportion of propionate increased from 13.1 to 17.5% (p < 0.001) while that of butyrate decreased from 11.0 to 9.55% (p < 0.001). The ratio of acetate to propionate (A/P) decreased from 5.44 to 3.96 (p < 0.001). Supplementary resveratrol increased ruminal population of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (p < 0.001) while decreased protozoa and methanogens. In conclusion, dietary resveratrol inhibited methanogenesis without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation.
TI  - Active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ADSC) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal pH, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included ADSC (Biomate; AB Vista, Marlborough, UK; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. During wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (HF) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). Cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (HG) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the HG until the end of wk 10. Feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. Ruminal pH was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. Ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative PCR. Cows were considered to have SARA if the duration below pH 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. Ruminal pH during wk 6 (HF plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at pH <5.6). The dietary regimen successfully induced SARA during wk 7 (transition from HF to HG diet), and ruminal pH (551 +/- 46 min/d at pH <5.6) was not different across treatments. However, cows receiving ADSC had an improved ruminal pH (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at pH <5.6) during wk 10 (HG plateau) compared with control. Additionally, cows receiving ADSC had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the HG phase (wk 8 to 10). During HG feeding, cows receiving ADSC had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mM for ADSC and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for ADSC and control, respectively). Microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with S. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in S. cerevisiae, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had 2.2-fold reduction in Prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant during SARA. Prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had a 2.3-fold increase in Streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in Megasphaera elsdenii. The reduction in M. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for ADSC cows. In conclusion, ADSC supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the condition of SARA caused by abrupt dietary changes from HF to HG, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.
TI  - Molecular modeling and MM-PBSA free energy analysis of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) is the enzyme from Ruminococcus albus 8 (R. albus 8) (Xyn10A), and catalyzes the degradation of arabinoxylan, which is a major cell wall non-starch polysaccharide of cereals. The crystallographic structure of Xyn10A is still unknown. For this reason, we report a computer-assisted homology study conducted to build its three-dimensional structure based on the known sequence of amino acids of this enzyme. In this study, the best similarity was found with the Clostridium thermocellum (C. thermocellum) N-terminal endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase 10 b. Following the 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a reliable model was obtained for further studies. Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) methods were used for the substrate xylotetraose having the reactive sugar, which was bound in the -1 subsite of Xyn10A in the 4C1 (chair) and 2SO (skew boat) ground state conformations. According to the simulations and free energy analysis, Xyn10A binds the substrate with the -1 sugar in the 2SO conformation 39.27 kcal.mol(-1) tighter than the substrate with the sugar in the 4C1 conformation. According to the Xyn10A-2SO Xylotetraose (X4(sb) interaction energies, the most important subsite for the substrate binding is subsite -1. The results of this study indicate that the substrate is bound in a skew boat conformation with Xyn10A and the -1 sugar subsite proceeds from the 4C1 conformation through 2SO to the transition state. MM-PBSA free energy analysis indicates that Asn187 and Trp344 in subsite -1 may an important residue for substrate binding. Our findings provide fundamental knowledge that may contribute to further enhancement of enzyme performance through molecular engineering.
TI  - Hydrogen formation and its regulation in Ruminococcus albus: involvement of an electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase, of a non-electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase, and of a putative hydrogen-sensing [FeFe]-hydrogenase.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 7 has played a key role in the development of the concept of interspecies hydrogen transfer. The rumen bacterium ferments glucose to 1.3 acetate, 0.7 ethanol, 2 CO2, and 2.6 H2 when growing in batch culture and to 2 acetate, 2 CO2, and 4 H2 when growing in continuous culture in syntrophic association with H2-consuming microorganisms that keep the H2 partial pressure low. The organism uses NAD(+) and ferredoxin for glucose oxidation to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO2, NADH for the reduction of acetyl-CoA to ethanol, and NADH and reduced ferredoxin for the reduction of protons to H2. Of all the enzymes involved, only the enzyme catalyzing the formation of H2 from NADH remained unknown. Here, we report that R. albus 7 grown in batch culture on glucose contained, besides a ferredoxin-dependent [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA2), a ferredoxin- and NAD-dependent electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydABC) that couples the endergonic formation of H2 from NADH to the exergonic formation of H2 from reduced ferredoxin. Interestingly, hydA2 is adjacent to the hydS gene, which is predicted to encode an [FeFe]-hydrogenase with a C-terminal PAS domain. We showed that hydS and hydA2 are part of a larger transcriptional unit also harboring putative genes for a bifunctional acetaldehyde/ethanol dehydrogenase (Aad), serine/threonine protein kinase, serine/threonine protein phosphatase, and a redox-sensing transcriptional repressor. Since HydA2 and Aad are required only when R. albus grows at high H2 partial pressures, HydS could be a H2-sensing [FeFe]-hydrogenase involved in the regulation of their biosynthesis.
TI  - Influence of Yeast Fermented Cassava Chip Protein (YEFECAP) and Roughage to Concentrate Ratio on Ruminal Fermentation and Microorganisms Using In vitro Gas Production Technique.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein sources and roughage (R) to concentrate (C) ratio on in vitro fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. The experimental design was a 2x5 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design (CRD). Factor A was 2 levels of protein sources yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) and soybean meal (SBM) and factor B was 5 levels of roughage to concentrate (R:C) ratio at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, and 0:100, respectively. Rice straw was used as a roughage source. It was found that gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) of YEFECAP supplemented group was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in SBM supplemented group. Moreover, the intercept value (a), gas production from the insoluble fraction (b), gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c), potential extent of gas production (a+b) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were influenced (p<0.01) by R:C ratio. In addition, protein source had no effect (p>0.05) on ether in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic (IVOMD) while R:C ratio affected the IVDMD and IVOMD (p<0.01). Moreover, YEFECAP supplanted group showed a significantly increased (p<0.05) total VFA and C3 while C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production were decreased when compared with SBM supplemented group. In addition, a decreasing R:C ratio had a significant effect (p<0.05) on increasing total VFA, C3 and NH3-N, but decreasing the C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production (p<0.01). Furthermore, total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus populations in YEFECAP supplemented group were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in the SBM supplemented group while fungal zoospores, methanogens and protozoal population remained unchanged (p>0.05) as compared between the two sources of protein. Moreover, fungal zoospores and total bacteria population were significantly increased (p<0.01) while, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, methanogens and protozoal population were decreased (p<0.01) with decreasing R:C ratio. In conclusion, YEFECAP has a potential for use as a protein source for improving rumen fermentation efficiency in ruminants.
TI  - Effects of Methylcellulose on Fibrolytic Bacterial Detachment and In vitro Degradation of Rice Straw.
AB  - Two in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of methylcellulose (MC) on i) bacterial detachment from rice straw as well as ii) inhibition of bacterial attachment and fiber digestibility. To evaluate the effect of MC on fibrolytic bacterial detachment (Exp 1), in vitro bacterial cultures with 0.1% (w/v) MC solution were compared with cultures without MC after 8 h incubation. The effect of MC on inhibition of bacterial attachment was determined by comparing with real-time PCR the populations of F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and R. albus established on rice straw pre-treated with 0.1% MC with those on untreated straw after incubation for 0, 6 and 12 h (Exp 2). The major fibrolytic bacterial attachment on rice straw showed significantly lower populations with either the addition of MC to the culture or pre-treated rice straw compared to controls (p<0.05). Also, the digestibility of rice straw with MC was significantly lower compared with control (p<0.05). The F. succinogenes population did not show detachment from rice straw, but showed an inhibition of attachment and proliferation on rice straw in accordance with a decrease of fiber digestion. The detachments of Ruminococcus species co-existed preventing the proliferations with subsequent reduction of fiber degradation by MC during the incubation. Their detachments were induced from stable colonization as well as the initial adhesion on rice straw by MC in in vitro ruminal fermentation. Furthermore, the detachment of R. albus was more sensitive to MC than was R. flavefaciens. These results showed the certain evidence that attachment of major fibrolytic bacteria had an effect on fiber digestion in the rumen, and each of fibrolytic bacteria, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and R. albus had a specific mechanism of attachment and detachment to fiber.
TI  - Rumen cellulosomics: divergent fiber-degrading strategies revealed by comparative genome-wide analysis of six ruminococcal strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A complex community of microorganisms is responsible for efficient plant cell wall digestion by many herbivores, notably the ruminants. Understanding the different fibrolytic mechanisms utilized by these bacteria has been of great interest in agricultural and technological fields, reinforced more recently by current efforts to convert cellulosic biomass to biofuels. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we have used a bioinformatics-based approach to explore the cellulosome-related components of six genomes from two of the primary fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen: Ruminococcus flavefaciens (strains FD-1, 007c and 17) and Ruminococcus albus (strains 7, 8 and SY3). The genomes of two of these strains are reported for the first time herein. The data reveal that the three R. flavefaciens strains encode for an elaborate reservoir of cohesin- and dockerin-containing proteins, whereas the three R. albus strains are cohesin-deficient and encode mainly dockerins and a unique family of cell-anchoring carbohydrate-binding modules (family 37). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our comparative genome-wide analysis pinpoints rare and novel strain-specific protein architectures and provides an exhaustive profile of their numerous lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. This work provides blueprints of the divergent cellulolytic systems in these two prominent fibrolytic rumen bacterial species, each of which reflects a distinct mechanistic model for efficient degradation of cellulosic biomass.
TI  - Magnesium requirement of some of the principal rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Information available on the role of Mg for growth and cellulose degradation by rumen bacteria is both limited and inconsistent. In this study, the Mg requirements for two strains each of the cellulolytic rumen species Fibrobacter succinogenes (A3c and S85), Ruminococcus albus (7 and 8) and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (B34b and C94) were investigated. Maximum growth, rate of growth and lag time were all measured using a complete factorial design, 2(3)x6; factors were: strains (2), within species (3) and Mg concentrations (6). R. flavefaciens was the only species that did not grow when Mg was singly deleted from the media, and both strains exhibited a linear growth response to increasing Mg concentrations (P<0.001). The requirement for R. flavefaciens B34b was estimated as 0.54 mM; whereas the requirement for R. flavefaciens C94 was >0.82 as there was no plateau in growth. Although not an absolute requirement for growth, strains of the two other species of cellulolytic bacteria all responded to increasing Mg concentrations. For F. succinogenes S85, R. albus 7 and R. albus 8, their requirement estimated from maximum growth was 0.56, 0.52 and 0.51, respectively. A requirement for F. succinogenes A3c could not be calculated because there was no solution for contrasts. Whether R. flavefaciens had a Mg requirement for cellulose degradation was determined in NH3-free cellulose media, using a 2x4 factorial design, 2 strains and 4 treatments. Both strains of R. flavefaciens were found to have an absolute Mg requirement for cellulose degradation. Based on reported concentrations of Mg in the rumen, 1.0 to 10.1 mM, it seems unlikely that an in vivo deficiency of this element would occur.
TI  - Effect of tannins and saponins in Samanea saman on rumen environment, milk yield  and milk composition in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tannins and saponins in Samanea saman on rumen fermentation, milk yield and milk composition in lactating dairy cows. Four multiparous early-lactating dairy cows (Holstein-Friesian cross-bred, 75%) with an initial body weight (BW) of 405 +/- 40 kg and 36 +/- 8 day in milk were randomly assigned to receive dietary treatments according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The four dietary treatments were unsupplemented (control), supplemented with rain tree pod (S. saman) meal (RPM) at 60 g/kg, supplemented with palm oil (PO) at 20 g/kg, and supplemented with RPM at 60 g/kg and PO at 20 g/kg (RPO), of total dry matter (DM) intake. Cows were fed with concentrate diets at a ratio of concentrate to milk yield of 1:2, and chopped 30 g/kg of urea-treated rice straw was fed ad libitum. The RPM contained condensed tannins and crude saponins at 88 and 141 g/kg of DM respectively. It was found that supplementation with RPM and/or PO to dairy cows diets did not show negative effect on ruminal pH, blood urea nitrogen and milk urea nitrogen concentration (p > 0.05). However, supplementation with RPM resulted in lower ammonia nitrogen (NH3 -N) concentration (p < 0.05). In addition, propionic acid and milk production increased while acetic acid, acetic to propionic ratio, methane production, methanogens and protozoal population decreased with RPM and/or PO supplementation. Furthermore, addition of PO and RPO in the diets increased milk fat while supplementation of RPM resulted in greater milk protein and Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers (p < 0.05). The population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by any treatments. The findings on the present study showed that supplementation with RPM and RPO to diets of cows improved the rumen environment and increased milk yield, content of milk protein and milk fat.
TI  - Effect of feeding palm oil by-products based diets on total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the rumen of goats.
AB  - Rumen microorganisms are responsible for digestion and utilization of dietary feeds by host ruminants. Unconventional feed resources could be used as alternatives in tropical areas where feed resources are insufficient in terms of quality and quantity. The objective of the present experiment was to evaluate the effect of diets based on palm oil (PO), decanter cake (DC) or palm kernel cake (PKC) on rumen total bacteria, selected cellulolytic bacteria, and methanogenic archaea. Four diets: control diet (CD), decanter cake diet (DCD), palm kernel cake diet (PKCD) and CD plus 5% PO diet (CPOD) were fed to rumen cannulated goats and rumen samples were collected at the start of the experimental diets (day 0) and on days 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 and 30 post dietary treatments. Feeding DCD and PKCD resulted in significantly higher (P<0.05) DNA copy number of total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefeciens, and Ruminococcus albus. Rumen methanogenic archaea was significantly lower (P<0.05) in goats fed PKCD and CPOD and the trend showed a severe reduction on days 4 and 6 post experimental diets. In conclusion, results indicated that feeding DCD and PKC increased the populations of cellulolytic bacteria and decreased the density of methanogenic archaea in the rumen of goats.
TI  - Effects of isobutyrate supplementation on ruminal microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in Simmental steers.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of isobutyrate supplementation on rumen microflora, enzyme activities and methane emissions in Simmental steers consuming a corn stover-based diet. Eight ruminally cannulated Simmental steers were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square experiment. The treatments were control (without isobutyrate), low isobutyrate (LIB), moderate isobutyrate (MIB) and high isobutyrate (HIB) with 8.4, 16.8 and 25.2 g isobutyrate per steer per day respectively. Isobutyrate was hand-mixed into the concentrate portion. Diet consisted of 60% corn stover and 40% concentrate [dry matter (DM) basis]. Dry matter intake (averaged 9 kg/day) was restricted to a maximum of 90% of ad libitum intake. Population of total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and anaerobic fungi were linearly increased, whereas that of protozoa and total methanogens was linearly reduced with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Real-time PCR quantification of population of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Fibrobacter succinogenes was linearly increased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosidase were linearly increased, whereas that of protease was linearly reduced. Methane production was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Effective degradabilities of cellulose and hemicellulose of corn stover were linearly increased, whereas that of crude protein in diet was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. The present results indicate that isobutyrate supplemented improved microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in steers. It was suggested that the isobutyrate stimulated the digestive micro-organisms or enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. In the experimental conditions of this trial, the optimum isobutyrate dose was approximately 16.8 g isobutyrate per steer per day.
TI  - Interaction of rumen bacteria as assumed by colonization patterns on untreated and alkali-treated rice straw.
AB  - Colonization patterns of representative rumen bacteria were compared between untreated rice straw (UTS) and sodium hydroxide-treated rice straw (SHTS). UTS and SHTS were incubated in the rumen of sheep for 10 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h using the nylon bag method. The population sizes of 13 representative bacterial species or groups were quantified by real-time PCR. The total bacterial population size (abundance) was similar in both UTS and SHTS. Fibrobacter succinogenes showed a higher population size compared to other fibrolytic species and was detected at a higher level in SHTS (3.7%) than in UTS (2.6%). Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were also detected at higher levels in SHTS (0.15% and 0.29%) than in UTS (0.03% and 0.18%). Population sizes of non-fibrolytic species, such as Selenomonas ruminantium, Anaerovibrio lipolytica and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were higher in UTS than in SHTS. Coefficient of determination (r(2) ) on population changes between bacterial species or groups were higher in UTS than in SHTS, suggesting the necessity of stronger bacterial interactions for UTS digestion. Therefore, not only colonization of fibrolytic species, but also synergistic interactions between different bacterial species may be key to the ruminal digestion of rice straw.
TI  - Nitrogen utilization and metabolism in Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - The model rumen Firmicutes organism Ruminococcus albus 8 was grown using ammonia, urea, or peptides as the sole nitrogen source; growth was not observed with amino acids as the sole nitrogen source. Growth of R. albus 8 on ammonia and urea showed the same growth rate (0.08 h(-1)) and similar maximum cell densities (for ammonia, the optical density at 600 nm [OD600] was 1.01; and for urea, the OD600 was 0.99); however, growth on peptides resulted in a nearly identical growth rate (0.09 h(-1)) and a lower maximum cell density (OD600 = 0.58). To identify differences in gene expression and enzyme activities, the transcript abundances of 10 different genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and specific enzyme activities were analyzed by harvesting mRNA and crude protein from cells at the mid- and late exponential phases of growth on the different N sources. Transcript abundances and enzyme activities varied according to nitrogen source, ammonia concentration, and growth phase. Growth of R. albus 8 on ammonia and urea was similar, with the only observed difference being an increase in urease transcript abundance and enzyme activity in urea-grown cultures. Growth of R. albus 8 on peptides showed a different nitrogen metabolism pattern, with higher gene transcript abundance levels of gdhA, glnA, gltB, amtB, glnK, and ureC, as well as higher activities of glutamate dehydrogenase and urease. These results demonstrate that ammonia, urea, and peptides can all serve as nitrogen sources for R. albus and that nitrogen metabolism genes and enzyme activities of R. albus 8 are regulated by nitrogen source and the level of ammonia in the growth medium.
TI  - Effect of dietary physically effective fiber on ruminal fermentation and the fatty acid profile of milk in dairy goats.
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to characterize the relationship among rumen fermentation variables, milk fatty acid profile, and dietary physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) content in a study that controlled for the potential confounding effects of dissimilar dry matter intake among treatments. Ten multiparous Xinong Saanen dairy goats were divided into 2 groups with 2 ruminally cannulated goats per group. Goats in each group were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (high and low peNDF) according to a 2x2 crossover design with 2 periods. The peNDF content of alfalfa hay (proportion of neutral detergent fiber retained on an 8.0-mm screen) was 42.1% for the high-peNDF and 14.5% for the low-peNDF group. To ensure similar dry matter intake, each morning the amount of alfalfa hay consumed on the prior day by the high-peNDF group was determined (amount offered minus morning refusals), and this was the amount of hay offered to the low-peNDF group that day. Each adaptation period consisted of 21d, followed by a 9-d sampling period. Dry matter intake and milk production and composition were similar between treatments. Milk energy efficiency increased with low dietary peNDF. Duration of pH below 5.60 was longer for goats fed the low-peNDF ration compared with the high-peNDF ration (4.08 vs. 0.41h/d); however, mean rumen pH (6.05 vs. 6.13) was not different between treatments. Reducing dietary peNDF increased rumen total volatile fatty acids (114.6 vs. 95.1mM) and decreased chewing time (404 vs. 673min/d), but did not affect the ratios of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased with reduced dietary peNDF, but Ruminococcus albus proportions were not influenced by treatment. Reducing dietary peNDF decreased the proportion of iso C14:0, iso C15:0, and trans-11 C18:1 in milk fat, whereas the iso C17:0 and trans-10 C18:1 increased. This study demonstrated that low dietary peNDF in dairy goats increases rumen volatile fatty acids, reduces chewing time, and is correlated to the amount of F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens.
TI  - Combinations of nitrate, saponin, and sulfate additively reduce methane production by rumen cultures in vitro while not adversely affecting feed digestion, fermentation or microbial communities.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of saponin (0.6g/L), nitrate (5mM) and sulfate (5mM), alone and in combinations, on methanogenesis, rumen fermentation, microbial community, and abundances of select microbial populations using in vitro rumen culture. Combinations of nitrate with saponin and/or sulfate additively suppressed methane production, with the lowest reduction (nearly 46%) observed for the combination of all the three inhibitors. None of the treatments adversely affected feed digestion or rumen fermentation. All the inhibitors, either alone or in combinations, did not alter the abundances of total bacteria, Ruminococcus albus, or archaea. However, saponin, alone and together with nitrate and/or sulfate, increased the abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, but decreased that of protozoa. DGGE analyses revealed limited changes in both bacterial and archaeal communities by the treatments. The nitrate-saponin-sulfate combination may be an effective and practical strategy to mitigate methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Determination of bacteria constituting ruminal fibrolytic consortia developed on  orchard grass hay stem.
AB  - To determine the relationship between Fibrobacter succinogenes and other rumen bacteria, the bacterial community structure on fiber was analyzed by using two different materials. These were ruminally incubated orchard grass hay stems without and with preincubation with F. succinogenes (natural and artificial consortia, respectively). The natural consortium mainly consisted of Firmicutes (56.6%) and Bacteroidetes (33.1%), while the artificial consortium showed a significantly higher proportion of Firmicutes (85.5%) and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes (4.6%). At species or genus level, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, the U2 group, Ruminococcus albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis made up a higher proportion in the artificial consortium. The most dominant bacterial group was the Butyrivibrio-Pseudobutyrivibrio-Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis group, which accounted for 19.7% in the natural and 29.5% in the artificial consortium. Within the genus Butyrivibrio, the phylogenetic groups SA and VA2 and phylogeny-undefined Butyribivrio, but not VA1, were detected at high frequency in the artificial consortium. These results suggest that ecological and possibly functional relationships exist in the rumen among F. succinogenes, a subset of B. fibrisolvens, the U2 group, R. albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis.
TI  - Rumen microbes and microbial protein synthesis in Thai native beef cattle fed with feed blocks supplemented with a urea-calcium sulphate mixture.
AB  - The influence of slow-release urea ( urea-calcium sulphate mixture; U-CaS) in feed blocks on rumen micro-organisms, predominant cellulolytic bacteria, microbial protein synthesis and ecology was studied in Thai native beef cattle. Four animals with an initial body weight of 100 +/- 3.0 kg were randomly assigned to a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments (U-CaS in iso-nitrogen feed blocks at 0, 120, 150 and 180 g/kg dry matter (DM), respectively; U-CaS replaced urea). After 21 days of experimental feeding, rumen fluid was collected at 0 and 4 h after feeding. The mean intake of feed blocks and other feedstuffs offered (rice straw and concentrates) amounted to 0.3, 2.3 and 0.6 kg DM/day, respectively. Inclusion of U-CaS did not altered pH and temperature in the rumen. However, ruminal NH3-N concentration decreased quadratically (p < 0.05) in response to U-CaS inclusion, with the lowest value at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. With inclusion of U-CaS, the populations of rumen bacteria increased quadratically (p < 0.05) and counts of fungal zoospores were linearly enhanced (p < 0.05), being highest at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. Supplementation of U-CaS increased the concentration of total bacteria linearly (p < 0.05) and of Fibrobacter succinogenes quadratically (p < 0.05), whereas Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by dietary treatments. Microbial crude protein yield and efficiency of microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis were linearly increased with different levels of U-CaS addition. Furthermore, current data clearly indicate that inclusion of U-CaS in feed blocks can affect micro-organism diversity and major cellulolytic bacteria.
TI  - Eremophila glabra reduces methane production and methanogen populations when fermented in a Rusitec.
AB  - Eremophila glabra Juss. (Scrophulariaceae), a native Australian shrub, has been demonstrated to have low methanogenic potential in a batch in vitro fermentation system. The present study aimed to test longer-term effects of E. glabra on rumen fermentation characteristics, particularly methane production and the methanogen population, when included as a component of a fermentation substrate in an in vitro continuous culture system (Rusitec). E. glabra was included at 150, 250, 400 g/kg DM (EG15, EG25, and EG40) with an oaten chaff and lupin-based substrate (control). Overall, the experiment lasted 33 days, with 12 days of acclimatization, followed by two periods during which fermentation characteristics (total gas, methane and VFA productions, dry matter disappearance, pH) were measured. The number of copies of genes specifically associated with total bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria (16S rRNA gene) and total ruminal methanogenic archaeal organisms (the methyl coenzyme M reductase A gene (mcrA)) was also measured during this time using quantitative real-time PCR. Total gas production, methane and volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly reduced with addition of E. glabra. At the end of the experiment, the overall methane reduction was 32% and 45% for EG15 and EG25 respectively, compared to the control, and the reduction was in a dose-dependent manner. Total bacterial numbers did not change, but the total methanogen population decreased by up to 42.1% (EG40) when compared to the control substrate. The Fibrobacter succinogenes population was reduced at all levels of E. glabra, while Ruminococcus albus was reduced only by EG40. Our results indicate that replacing a portion of a fibrous substrate with E. glabra maintained a significant reduction in methane production and methanogen populations over three weeks in vitro, with some minor inhibition on overall fermentation at the lower inclusion levels.
TI  - Detection of fiber-digesting bacteria in the forestomach contents of llamas (Lama glama) by PCR.
AB  - The high fibrolytic activity and large biomass of strictly-anaerobic bacteria that inhabit the rumen makes them primarily responsible for the degradation of the forage consumed by ruminants. Llamas feed mainly on low quality fibrous roughages that are digested by an active and diverse microflora. The products of this fermentation are volatile fatty acids and microbial biomass, which will be used by the animals. The aim of this study was to detect the three major fiber-digesting anaerobic bacteria in the forestomach contents of llamas by PCR. In this study, we detected Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes in the forestomach contents of eight native llamas from Argentina.
TI  - Use of real-time PCR technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in Indian Surti buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
AB  - In the milk industry in India, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. Efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. Bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. Absolute quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify ten bacterial species in rumen fluid of Surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of Ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the ruminal Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Prevotella species. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Treponema bryantii and Anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Analysis of rumen microbial populations in lactating dairy cattle fed diets varying in carbohydrate profiles and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product.
AB  - The rumen microbial ecosystem is a critical factor that links diets to bovine physiology and productivity; however, information about dietary effects on microbial populations has generally been limited to small numbers of samples and qualitative assessment. To assess whether consistent shifts in microbial populations occur in response to common dietary manipulations in dairy cattle, samples of rumen contents were collected from 2 studies for analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In one study, lactating Holstein cows (n=8) were fed diets in which a nonforage fiber source replaced an increasing proportion of forages and concentrates in a 4x4 Latin square design, and samples of ruminal digesta were collected at 9-h intervals over 3 d at the end of each period. In the second study, lactating Holstein cows (n=15) were fed diets with or without the inclusion of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP) in a crossover design. In this study, rumen liquid and solid samples were collected during total rumen evacuations before and after feeding in a 42-h period. In total, 146 samples of ruminal digesta were used for microbial DNA isolation and analysis by qPCR. Validated primer sets were used to quantify total bacterial and anaerobic fungal populations as well as 12 well-studied bacterial taxa. The relative abundance of the target populations was similar to those previously reported. No significant treatment effects were observed for any target population. A significant interaction of treatment and dry matter intake was observed, however, for the abundance of Eubacterium ruminantium. Increasing dry matter intake was associated with a quadratic decrease in E. ruminantium populations in control animals but with a quadratic increase in E.ruminantium populations in cows fed SCFP. Analysis of sample time effects revealed that Fibrobacter succinogenes and fungal populations were more abundant postfeeding, whereas Ruminococcus albus tended to be more abundant prefeeding. Seven of the target taxa were more abundant in either the liquid or solid fractions of ruminal digesta. By accounting for the total mass of liquid and solid fractions in the rumen and the relative abundance of total bacteria in each fraction, it was estimated that 92% of total bacteria were found in the solid digesta fraction.
TI  - Modulation of acceptor specificity of Ruminococcus albus cellobiose phosphorylase through site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - Cellobiose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.20, CBP) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of cellobiose to alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) and d-glucose. Cys485, Tyr648, and Glu653 of CBP from Ruminococcus albus, situated at the +1 subsite, were mutated to modulate acceptor specificity. C485A, Y648F, and Y648V were active enough for analysis. Their acceptor specificities were compared with the wild type based on the apparent kinetic parameters determined in the presence of 10 mM Glc1P. C485A showed higher preference for D-glucosamine than the wild type. Apparent kcat/Km values of Y648F for D-mannose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose were 8.2- and 4.0-fold higher than those of the wild type, respectively. Y648V had synthetic activity toward N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, while the other variants did not. The oligosaccharide production in the presence of the same concentrations of wild type and each mutant was compared. C485A produced 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucosamine from 10 mM Glc1P and D-glucosamine at a rate similar to the wild type. Y648F and Y648V produced 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine much more rapidly than the wild type when D-mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine were used as acceptors, respectively. After a 4h reaction, the amounts of 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine produced by Y648F and Y648V were 5.9- and 12-fold higher than the wild type, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of Ruminococcus albus cellodextrin phosphorylase and identification of a key phenylalanine residue for acceptor specificity and affinity to the phosphate group.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus has the ability to intracellularly degrade cello-oligosaccharides primarily via phosphorolysis. In this study, the enzymatic characteristics of R. albus cellodextrin phosphorylase (RaCDP), which is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 94, was investigated. RaCDP catalyzes the phosphorolysis of cellotriose through an ordered 'bi bi' mechanism in which cellotriose binds to RaCDP before inorganic phosphate, and then cellobiose and glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) are released in that order. Among the cello-oligosaccharides tested, RaCDP had the highest phosphorolytic and synthetic activities towards cellohexaose and cellopentaose, respectively. RaCDP successively transferred glucosyl residues from Glc1P to the growing cello-oligosaccharide chain, and insoluble cello-oligosaccharides comprising a mean of eight residues were produced. Sophorose, laminaribiose, beta-1,4-xylobiose, beta-1,4-mannobiose and cellobiitol served as acceptors for RaCDP. RaCDP had very low affinity for phosphate groups in both the phosphorolysis and synthesis directions. A sequence comparison revealed that RaCDP has Gln at position 646 where His is normally conserved in the phosphate binding sites of related enzymes. A Q646H mutant showed approximately twofold lower apparent K(m) values for inorganic phosphate and Glc1P than the wild-type. RaCDP has Phe at position 633 corresponding to Tyr and Val in the +1 subsites of cellobiose phosphorylase and N,N'-diacetylchitobiose phosphorylase, respectively. A F633Y mutant showed higher preference for cellobiose over beta-1,4-mannobiose as an acceptor substrate in the synthetic reaction than the wild-type. Furthermore, the F633Y mutant showed 75- and 1100-fold lower apparent Km values for inorganic phosphate and Glc1P, respectively, in phosphorolysis and synthesis of cellotriose.
TI  - Expression of cellulosome components and type IV pili within the extracellular proteome of Ruminococcus flavefaciens 007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ruminococcus flavefaciens is an important fibre-degrading bacterium found in the mammalian gut. Cellulolytic strains from the bovine rumen have been shown to produce complex cellulosome structures that are associated with the cell surface. R. flavefaciens 007 is a highly cellulolytic strain whose ability to degrade dewaxed cotton, but not Avicel cellulose, was lost following initial isolation in the variant 007S. The ability was recovered after serial subculture to give the cotton-degrading strain 007C. This has allowed us to investigate the factors required for degradation of this particularly recalcitrant form of cellulose. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The major proteins associated with the bacterial cell surface and with the culture supernatant were analyzed for R. flavefaciens 007S and 007C grown with cellobiose, xylan or Avicel cellulose as energy sources. Identification of the proteins was enabled by a draft genome sequence obtained for 007C. Among supernatant proteins a cellulosomal GH48 hydrolase, a rubrerthyrin-like protein and a protein with type IV pili N-terminal domain were the most strongly up-regulated in 007C cultures grown on Avicel compared with cellobiose. Strain 007S also showed substrate-related changes, but supernatant expression of the Pil protein and rubrerythrin in particular were markedly lower in 007S than in 007C during growth on Avicel. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides new information on the extracellular proteome of R. flavefaciens and its regulation in response to different growth substrates. Furthermore it suggests that the cotton cellulose non-degrading strain (007S) has altered regulation of multiple proteins that may be required for breakdown of cotton cellulose. One of these, the type IV pilus was previously shown to play a role in adhesion to cellulose in R. albus, and a related pilin protein was identified here for the first time as a major extracellular protein in R. flavefaciens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Direct ethanol production from cellulosic materials by Zymobacter palmae carrying Cellulomonas endoglucanase and Ruminococcus beta-glucosidase genes.
AB  - In order to reduce the cost of bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, we conferred the ability to ferment cellulosic materials directly on Zymobacter palmae by co-expressing foreign endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase genes. Z. palmae is a novel ethanol-fermenting bacterium capable of utilizing a broad range of sugar substrates, but not cellulose. Therefore, the six genes encoding the cellulolytic enzymes (CenA, CenB, CenD, CbhA, CbhB, and Cex) from Cellulomonas fimi were introduced and expressed in Z. palmae. Of these cellulolytic enzyme genes cloned, CenA degraded carboxymethylcellulose and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) efficiently. The extracellular CenA catalyzed the hydrolysis of barley beta-glucan and PASC to liberate soluble cello-oligosaccharides, indicating that CenA is the most suitable enzyme for cellulose degradation among those cellulolytic enzymes expressed in Z. palmae. Furthermore, the cenA gene and beta-glucosidase gene (bgl) from Ruminococcus albus were co-expressed in Z. palmae. Of the total endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase activities, 57.1 and 18.1 % were localized in the culture medium of the strain. The genetically engineered strain completely saccharified and fermented 20 g/l barley beta-glucan to ethanol within 84 h, producing 79.5 % of the theoretical yield. Thus, the production and secretion of CenA and BGL enabled Z. palmae to efficiently ferment a water-soluble cellulosic polysaccharide to ethanol.
TI  - Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on in vitro fermentation and microbial communities of low-quality forages and mixed diets.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (XP, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) on in vitro ruminal fermentation of single forage and mixed diets. In Exp. 1, an in vitro test was used to determine the effects of various concentrations (0, 1, 2, and 3 g/L) of XP on ruminal fermentation of the major forage sources of China (rice straw, RS; corn stover, CS; corn silage without grain, CSNG; and corn silage with grain, CSG). Total VFA reached a peak at 1 g/L XP for RS, CSNG, and CSG and increased linearly (P < 0.01) for CS. The molar proportion of acetate decreased and propionate increased linearly (P < 0.01) with an increasing amount of XP for RS, CS, and CSNG. Microbial protein (MCP) increased linearly (P < 0.01) with an increasing level of XP for RS, and it reached peak values at 1 and 2 g/L XP for CSG and CSNG, respectively. Fungi population was increased (P < 0.05) with 1 g/L XP for all forages except CSNG. The population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased (P < 0.05) at 1 or 2 g/L XP for RS, CSNG, and CSG. In Exp. 2, the effects of 3 concentrations of XP (0, 1, and 2 g/L) were tested on in vitro ruminal fermentation of 3 mixed diets with various ingredient combinations: 1) CSC (corn:soybean meal:corn stover = 33:22:45), 2) CSCC (corn:soybean meal:corn stover:corn silage = 33:22:22.5:22.5), and 3) CSCCA (corn:soybean meal:corn stover:corn silage:alfalfa = 33:22:19:21:5). Total VFA concentrations were influenced by diets (P < 0.01) and were enhanced linearly by increasing concentrations of XP (P < 0.01). The molar proportion of acetate was reduced (P < 0.01), but the propionate proportion was enhanced with increasing concentrations of XP (P < 0.01). Ammonia N was decreased and MCP was increased by the addition of XP (linear, P < 0.01; quadratic, P < 0.05). The fungi population was greater with XP addition (quadratic, P < 0.01). The percentage of R. albus was affected by diets (P < 0.01), the level of XP (linear and quadratic, P < 0.01), and their interaction (P < 0.01). From these 2 in vitro studies, it is inferred that the addition of XP could improve the rumen fermentation of forages and mixed diets by stimulating the number of fiber-digesting rumen microbes, especially fungi populations.
TI  - Albusin B, mass-produced by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae suppression system, enhances lipid utilisation and antioxidant capacity in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Albusin B (bacteriocin), isolated from Ruminococcus albus 7 and mass-produced by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system, has previously been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism in broiler chickens. The present study was focused on the effect of albusin B on lipid metabolism in mice and the potential of albusin B-expressing yeast product (albusin B) as a food supplement. Forty-five BALB/c male mice at 6 weeks of age were each orally administered normal saline (control), yeast (0.125 mg kg(-1) ) or albusin B (0.125 mg kg(-1) ) for 14 days and then euthanised. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, albusin B-fed mice exhibited decreased body weight and plasma levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids but increased plasma high-density lipoprotein. Albusin B-fed mice showed higher mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation in the ileum, heart and liver than control mice. Compared with the control treatment, both yeast and albusin B treatments caused a decrease in mRNA expression of fatty acid synthesis in the heart and liver. Moreover, albusin B suppressed mRNA levels of lipogenesis in the ileum and liver. Albusin B-fed mice exhibited more favourable adenosine triphosphate production and antioxidant capacity in the heart and liver. Albusin B treatment led to a significantly lower respiratory quotient than that of the control, whereas yeast treatment did not. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a beneficial effect of albusin B on lipid utilisation and anti-atherosclerotic and antioxidant capacities in mice. However, more comprehensive studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the effect of albusin B.
TI  - Lovastatin-enriched rice straw enhances biomass quality and suppresses ruminal methanogenesis.
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that solid state fermentation (SSF) of agro-biomass (using rice straw as model); besides, breaking down its lignocellulose content to improve its nutritive values also produces lovastatin which could be used to suppress methanogenesis in the rumen ecosystem. Fermented rice straw (FRS) containing lovastatin after fermentation with Aspergillus terreus was used as substrate for growth study of rumen microorganisms using in vitro gas production method. In the first experiment, the extract from the FRS (FRSE) which contained lovastatin was evaluated for its efficacy for reduction in methane (CH4) production, microbial population, and activity in the rumen fluid. FRSE reduced total gas and CH4 productions (P < 0.01). It also reduced (P < 0.01) total methanogens population and increased the cellulolytic bacteria including Ruminococcus albus, Fibrobacter succinogenes (P < 0.01), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (P < 0.05). Similarly, FRS reduced total gas and CH4 productions, methanogens population, but increased in vitro dry mater digestibility compared to the non-fermented rice straw. Lovastatin in the FRSE and the FRS significantly increased the expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene that produces HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme for cell membrane production in methanogenic Archaea.
TI  - Crystal structure of Ruminococcus albus cellobiose 2-epimerase: structural insights into epimerization of unmodified sugar.
AB  - Enzymatic epimerization is an important modification for carbohydrates to acquire diverse functions attributable to their stereoisomers. Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) catalyzes interconversion between d-glucose and d-mannose residues at the reducing end of beta-1,4-linked oligosaccharides. Here, we solved the structure of Ruminococcus albus CE (RaCE). The structure of RaCE showed strong similarity to those of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase and aldose-ketose isomerase YihS with a high degree of conservation of residues around the catalytic center, although sequence identity between them is low. Based on structural comparison, we found that His184 is required for RaCE activity as the third histidine added to two essential histidines in other sugar epimerases/isomerases. This finding was confirmed by mutagenesis, suggesting a new catalytic mechanism for CE involving three histidines.
TI  - Microbial ecosystem and fermentation traits in the caecum of growing rabbits given diets varying in neutral detergent soluble and insoluble fibre levels.
AB  - The effect of the level of neutral detergent fibre (NDF: 0.35, LI and 0.42, HI) and neutral detergent soluble fibre (NDSF: 0.14, LS and 0.17, HS) in the caecal ecosystem was studied in 24 weaned (28 days of age) rabbits, weighing 630 +/- 80.2 g in a 2 x 2 factorial design. After 22 days, rabbits were slaughtered and their caecal contents sampled. The caecal pH (on average 6.2) and molar volatile fatty acids (VFA) proportions were not affected by dietary treatments, but total VFA concentration tended to be lower with NDF (84.7 vs. 74.1 mmol/l; P = 0.095). The amount of total bacteria tended (P = 0.075) to increase with NDSF, but only in diets with 0.35 NDF. The caecal proportions of Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes were not affected by type or level of fibre, but Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens decreased (P = 0.055) with the NDF proportion in LS diets. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that bacterial communities clustered according to each combination of NDF and NDSF, but did not greatly differ among diets (similarity indexes between 0.67 and 0.70), nor biodiversity was affected (average Shannon and richness indexes 3.50 and 33.1; P > 0.10). Archaeal population revealed changes in the amount and composition that were particularly evident in HS diets, decreasing in concentration (from 4.37 to 4.12 log10 gene copy number/g) and biodiversity (Shannon index from 3.14 to 2.52 and richness index from 23.7 to 13.9) compared to LS. The type and level of dietary fibre had a minor impact on caecal fermentation traits or caecal bacterial community. However, the increase in NDSF from 0.14 to 0.17 reduced concentration and diversity of methanogenic archaea.
TI  - Characterisation of caecal microbial diversity of lactating does and their offspring given diets with different neutral detergent soluble to insoluble fibre ratios.
AB  - The effect of neutral detergent soluble fibre (NDSF) to neutral detergent fibre (NDF) dietary ratio (0.29, LR and 0.43, HR) on the caecal ecosystem of lactating does and their offspring was studied. From the 17th day of lactation, each diet was given to four does, allowing for free access to their litters. Does were sampled at 17 and 28 days of lactation, and also two pups per litter at 17 (milk-fed only), 28 (milk and solid fed) and 49 days of age. DGGE was used to study bacterial caecal biodiversity, and total bacterial concentration and relative proportions of Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were quantified by real time PCR. In does, diet did not affect (P > 0.10) diversity indexes, total bacterial concentration or relative abundance of B. fibrisolvens, but at 28 days of lactation the proportion of R. albus was higher with LR (interaction Diet x Time, P = 0.037). Caecal communities of pups of 17 days were grouped by litter, but the influence of the mother was reduced at 28 days with solid feed intake, and at 49 days rabbits clustered by diet. Caecal biodiversity increased from 17 to 28 days, and was reduced at 49 days (Shannon index of 3.60, 3.71 and 3.57, respectively; P = 0.049). Total bacterial concentration and relative abundance of R. albus and B. fibrisolvens increased with solid feed intake from 17 to 28 days (P < 0.01), remaining unaffected thereafter. Access of pups to solid feed from 17 days of age modulates the development and composition of the caecal microbiota at weaning.
TI  - Effects of coconut and fish oils on ruminal methanogenesis, fermentation, and abundance and diversity of microbial populations in vitro.
AB  - Coconut (CO) and fish (FO) oils were previously shown to inhibit rumen methanogenesis and biohydrogenation, which mitigates methane emission and helps improve beneficial fatty acids in meat and milk. This study aimed at investigating the comparative effects of CO and FO on the methanogenesis, fermentation, and microbial abundances and diversity in vitro rumen cultures containing different doses (0, 3.1, and 6.2 mL/L) of each oil and 400mg feed substrate using rumen fluid from lactating dairy cows as inocula. Increasing doses of CO and FO quadratically decreased concentrations of methane, but hydrogen concentrations were only increased quadratically by CO. Both oils linearly decreased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility of feeds but did not affect the concentration of total volatile fatty acids. However, CO reduced acetate percentage and acetate to propionate ratio and increased the percentages of propionate and butyrate to a greater extent than FO. Ammonia concentration was greater for CO than FO. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, FO had greater inhibition to methanogens than CO, but the opposite was true for protozoal, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Ruminococcus albus was not affected by either oil. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed that bacterial and archaeal community composition were changed differently by oil type. Based on Pareto-Lorenz evenness curve analysis of the DGGE profiles, CO noticeably changed the functional organization of archaea compared with FO. In conclusion, although both CO and FO decreased methane concentrations to a similar extent, the mode of reduction and the effect on abundances and diversity of archaeal and bacterial populations differed between the oils. Thus, the use of combination of CO and FO at a low dose may additively lower methanogenesis in the rumen while having little adverse effect on rumen fermentation.
TI  - Identification and characterization of cellobiose 2-epimerases from various aerobes.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE), found mainly in anaerobes, reversibly converts D-glucose residues at the reducing end of beta-1,4-linked oligosaccharides to D-mannose residues. In this study, we characterized CE-like proteins from various aerobes (Flavobacterium johnsoniae NBRC 14942, Pedobacter heparinus NBRC 12017, Dyadobacter fermentans ATCC 700827, Herpetosiphon aurantiacus ATCC 23779, Saccharophagus degradans ATCC 43961, Spirosoma linguale ATCC 33905, and Teredinibacter turnerae ATCC 39867), because aerobes, more easily cultured on a large scale than anaerobes, are applicable in industrial processes. The recombinant CE-like proteins produced in Escherichia coli catalyzed epimerization at the C2 position of cellobiose, lactose, epilactose, and beta-1,4-mannobiose, whereas N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, D-glucose, and D-mannose were inert as substrates. All the CEs, except for P. heparinus CE, the optimum pH of which was 6.3, showed highest activity at weakly alkaline pH. CEs from D. fermentans, H. aurantiacus, and S. linguale showed higher optimum temperatures and thermostability than the other enzymes analyzed. The enzymes from D. fermentans, S. linguale, and T. turnerae showed significantly high k(cat) and K(m) values towards cellobiose and lactose. Especially, T. turnerae CE showed a very high k(cat) value towards lactose, an attractive property for the industrial production of epilactose, which is carried out at high substrate concentrations.
TI  - Effects of replacing dietary starch with neutral detergent-soluble fibre on ruminal fermentation, microbial synthesis and populations of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC).
AB  - A rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) apparatus with eight 800 ml fermenters was used to investigate the effects of replacing dietary starch with neutral detergent-soluble fibre (NDSF) by inclusion of sugar beet pulp in diets on ruminal fermentation, microbial synthesis and populations of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria. Experimental diets contained 12.7, 16.4, 20.1 or 23.8% NDSF substituted for starch on a dry matter basis. The experiment was conducted over two independent 15-day incubation periods with the last 8 days used for data collection. There was a tendency that 16.4% NDSF in the diet increased the apparent disappearance of organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). Increasing dietary NDSF level increased carboxymethylcellulase and xylanase activity in the solid fraction and apparent disappearance of acid detergent fibre (ADF) but reduced the 16S rDNA copy numbers of Ruminococcus albus in both liquid and solid fractions and R. flavefaciens in the solid fraction. The apparent disappearance of dietary nitrogen (N) was reduced by 29.6% with increased dietary NDSF. Substituting NDSF for starch appeared to increase the ratios of acetate/propionate and methane/volatile fatty acids (VFA) (mol/mol). Replacing dietary starch with NDSF reduced the daily production of ammonia-N and increased the growth of the solid-associated microbial pellets (SAM). Total microbial N flow and efficiency of microbial synthesis (EMS), expressed as g microbial N/kg OM fermented, tended to increase with increased dietary NDSF, but the numerical increase did not continue as dietary NDSF exceeded 20.1% of diet DM. Results suggested that substituting NDSF for starch up to 16.4% of diet DM increased digestion of nutrients (except for N) and microbial synthesis, and further increases (from 16.4% to 23.8%) in dietary NDSF did not repress microbial synthesis but did significantly reduce digestion of dietary N.
TI  - Longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. Multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active UC over a period of 1 year. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in UC patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the UC mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. High clinical activity indices (CAI) and sigmoidoscopy scores (SS) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type E Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for Clostridium butyricum, Ruminococcus albus, and Eubacterium rectale. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low CAI. Only E. rectale and Clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. These findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in UC and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.
TI  - Ruminal fermentation and microbial ecology of buffaloes and cattle fed the same diet.
AB  - Although buffaloes and cattle are ruminants, their digestive capabilities and rumen microbial compositions are considered to be different. The purpose of this study was to compare the rumen microbial ecology of crossbred water buffaloes and cattle that were fed the same diet. Cattle exhibited a higher fermentation rate than buffaloes. Methane production and methanogen density were lower in buffaloes. Phylogenetic analysis of Fibrobacter succinogenes-specific 16S ribosomal RNA gene clone library showed that the diversity of groups within a species was significantly different (P < 0.05) between buffalo and cattle and most of the clones were affiliated with group 2 of the species. Population densities of F.succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens were higher until 6 h post-feeding in cattle; however, buffaloes exhibited different traits. The population of anaerobic fungi decreased at 3 h in cattle compared to buffaloes and was similar at 0 h and 6 h. The diversity profiles of bacteria and fungi were similar in the two species. The present study showed that the profiles of the fermentation process, microbial population and diversity were similar in crossbred water buffaloes and crossbred cattle.
TI  - Postprandial changes of fiber-degrading microbes in the rumen of sheep fed diets  varying in type of forage as monitored by real-time PCR and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis.
AB  - Four ruminally cannulated sheep were used in a crossover design to assess the postprandial changes of fiber-degrading microbes in the solid phase of the rumen of sheep fed 2 high-forage diets. The diets had forage:concentrate ratio of 70:30 (DM basis) and either alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay (AL) or grass hay (GR) as forage (FOR). Sheep were fed twice daily, and samples from solid rumen digesta were taken at 0, 4, and 8 h after the morning feeding. Postprandial changes of DNA concentrations of all determined microbial populations were similar for the 2 diets. Samples taken at 4 h after feeding had lesser (P < 0.05) concentrations of total bacterial DNA determined with real-time PCR and bacterial diversity and greater (P < 0.05) protozoal DNA concentrations, relative abundance of fungal, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus DNA compared with those taken at 0 and 8 h. No effect (P = 0.41 to 0.76) of FOR was detected either on concentrations of bacterial and protozoal DNA or the relative abundance of the 2 Ruminococcus DNA, but GR diet promoted greater (P < 0.001) relative abundance of F. succinogenes and fungal DNA compared with AL diet. Fibrobacter succinogenes was the most abundant (P < 0.05) of the 3 cellulolytic bacteria for both diets, with no differences (P < 0.05) between the 2 Ruminococcus species. Rumen pH and carboxymethylcellulase, Avicelase, and amylase activities were not affected (P = 0.15 to 0.69) by FOR, but xylanase activity was greater (P = 0.01) for GR diet. The influence of FOR on microbial communities in ruminal solid digesta was more evident in the first hours after feeding than at later times after feeding, which highlights the influence of sampling time when investigating dietary effects on rumen function and microbial populations.
TI  - Metabolic mechanism of mannan in a ruminal bacterium, Ruminococcus albus, involving two mannoside phosphorylases and cellobiose 2-epimerase: discovery of a new carbohydrate phosphorylase, beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharide phosphorylase.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus is a typical ruminal bacterium digesting cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11), which converts cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-D-mannose, is a particularly unique enzyme in R. albus, but its physiological function is unclear. Recently, a new metabolic pathway of mannan involving CE was postulated for another CE-producing bacterium, Bacteroides fragilis. In this pathway, beta-1,4-mannobiose is epimerized to 4-O-beta-D-mannosyl-D-glucose (Man-Glc) by CE, and Man-Glc is phosphorolyzed to alpha-D-mannosyl 1-phosphate (Man1P) and D-glucose by Man-Glc phosphorylase (MP; EC 2.4.1.281). Ruminococcus albus NE1 showed intracellular MP activity, and two MP isozymes, RaMP1 and RaMP2, were obtained from the cell-free extract. These enzymes were highly specific for the mannosyl residue at the non-reducing end of the substrate and catalyzed the phosphorolysis and synthesis of Man-Glc through a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. In a synthetic reaction, RaMP1 showed high activity only toward D-glucose and 6-deoxy-D-glucose in the presence of Man1P, whereas RaMP2 showed acceptor specificity significantly different from RaMP1. RaMP2 acted on D-glucose derivatives at the C2- and C3-positions, including deoxy- and deoxyfluoro-analogues and epimers, but not on those substituted at the C6-position. Furthermore, RaMP2 had high synthetic activity toward the following oligosaccharides: beta-linked glucobioses, maltose, N,N'-diacetylchitobiose, and beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides. Particularly, beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides served as significantly better acceptor substrates for RaMP2 than D-glucose. In the phosphorolytic reactions, RaMP2 had weak activity toward beta-1,4-mannobiose but efficiently degraded beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than beta-1,4-mannobiose. Consequently, RaMP2 is thought to catalyze the phosphorolysis of beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than beta-1,4-mannobiose to produce Man1P and beta-1,4-mannobiose.
TI  - Quantitative comparisons of select cultured and uncultured microbial populations  in the rumen of cattle fed different diets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number and diversity of uncultured ruminal bacterial and archaeal species revealed by 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences greatly exceeds that of cultured bacteria and archaea. However, the significance of uncultured microbes remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to assess the numeric importance of select uncultured bacteria and cultured bacteria and the impact of diets and microenvironments within cow rumen in a comparative manner. RESULTS: Liquid and adherent fractions were obtained from the rumen of Jersey cattle fed hay alone and Holstein cattle fed hay plus grain. The populations of cultured and uncultured bacteria present in each fraction were quantified using specific real-time PCR assays. The population of total bacteria was similar between fractions or diets, while total archaea was numerically higher in the hay-fed Jersey cattle than in the hay-grain-fed Holstein cattle. The population of the genus Prevotella was about one log smaller than that of total bacteria. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the genus Butyrivibrio, and R. albus was at least one log smaller than that of genus Prevotella. Four of the six uncultured bacteria quantified were as abundant as F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and the genus Butyrivibrio. In addition, the populations of several uncultured bacteria were significantly higher in the adherent fractions than in the liquid fractions. These uncultured bacteria may be associated with fiber degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Some uncultured bacteria are as abundant as those of major cultured bacteria in the rumen. Uncultured bacteria may have important contribution to ruminal fermentation. Population dynamic studies of uncultured bacteria in a comparative manner can help reveal their ecological features and importance to rumen functions.
TI  - Effects of quillaja and yucca saponins on communities and select populations of rumen bacteria and archaea, and fermentation in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate quillaja (QSP)  and yucca saponin (YSP) products with respect to their effects on diversity of rumen bacteria and archaea, abundance of selected microbes, and feed degradability and fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both QSP and YSP at doses 0-0.6 g l(-1) tended to increase degradability of feed substrate in in vitro rumen cultures, but to different extents. Neither one of the saponins affected the concentrations of ammonia, total volatile fatty acids, or molar proportion of acetate. However, QSP increased molar proportion of propionate and decreased that of butyrate, whereas YSP tended to decrease that of butyrate. As determined by qPCR, QSP and YSP did not affect the abundance of total bacteria or Ruminococcus albus. The QSP did not affect the abundances of Fibrobacter succinogenes or genus Prevotella, but tended to decrease that of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas YSP significantly increased the abundance of R. flavefaciens and Prevotella, and numerically increased that of F. succinogenes. Both saponins increased archaeal abundance, although to small magnitudes (0.3-0.4 log). The protozoal populations were decreased significantly by QSP, but not by YSP. Based on DGGE and T-RFLP analysis, both saponins altered the bacterial community and species organization, but less so the archaeal community. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that saponins, although not effective in mitigating methane emission, may improve feed utilization at low doses, and modulate ruminal microbial communities in a dose-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that saponins at low doses may directly stimulate the growth of some rumen bacteria including cellulolytic bacteria, thus improving digestibility of feeds, independent of their defaunation activity. In contrast, saponins at high doses modulate rumen fermentation characteristically similar to defaunation.
TI  - Use of Prevotella bryantii 25A and a commercial probiotic during subacute acidosis challenge in midlactation dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of Prevotella bryantii  25A as a probiotic during a subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge using a commercial probiotic as a positive control. Six multiparous ruminally fistulated cows (BW=685 +/- 65 kg; (mean +/- SD) in the mid-phase of lactation (70 to 148 DIM) received the following treatments in a replicated 3x3 Latin square design: (1) total mixed ration (TMR; control, CON), (2) TMR + 2g/head per day of a probiotic combination of Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EFSC), or (3) TMR + Prevotella bryantii 25A. The Latin square consisted of 3 wk of adaptation to the respective treatments during which the animals were fed ad libitum once per day a conventional early-lactation TMR and 1.5 kg of hay. The adaptation was followed by 4 d of SARA (no hay) and 10d of rest (adaptation diet without probiotics). Dry matter intake and milk production were depressed during SARA (22.0 and 31.8 kg/d, respectively) compared with adaptation (24.4 and 34.0 kg/d, respectively) and did not recover during rest (22.3 and 30.7 kg/d, respectively). During SARA, P. bryantii 25A had no effect on rumen pH, whereas EFSC reduced the percentage of time with pH <6.0 (71%) compared with CON (85%) and increased maximum pH. The EFSC treatment tended to increase mean pH over 24h (5.65) compared with CON (5.45). Proportion of time with pH <5.6 tended to be lower with EFSC (46%) than with CON (62%). Populations of bacteria considered to be the most important cellulose digesters in the rumen (Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes) were also monitored during these treatments using culture-independent real-time PCR methods. The population of R. flavefaciens was similar between the 2 feeding phases, whereas F. succinogenes and R. albus were lower during SARA compared with rest. In light of the present study, P. bryantii 25A did not prove to be an effective preventative for SARA. The role of EFSC in regulating rumen pH was confirmed, with a possible effect of maintaining R. flavefaciens populations during SARA.
TI  - Effects of Protein Level and Mangosteen Peel Pellets (Mago-pel) in Concentrate Diets on Rumen Fermentation and Milk Production in Lactating Dairy Crossbreds.
AB  - Four, lactating dairy crossbreds (50%x50% Holstein FriesianxNative Zebu cattle) were randomly assigned according to a 2x2 factorial arrangement (two protein levels and two levels of mangosteen peel pellets (Mago-pel)) in a 4x4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments. All cows received concentrate at a proportion of 1 kg concentrate per 2 kg of milk yield, and urea-treated 5% rice straw (UTRS) was given ad libitum. It was found that total dry matter intakes, nutrient digestibility, ruminal pH and NH3-N concentrations were not affected (p>0.05) by treatments. Concentrations of ruminal pH and NH3-N were not affected by dietary treatments although the concentration of BUN varied significantly (p<0.05) between protein levels (p<0.05). The populations of rumen bacteria and fungal zoospores did not differ among treatments (p>0.05); however, the population of protozoa was decreased (p<0.05) when cows received Mago-pel supplementation. The composition of the population of bacteria, identified by real-time PCR technique, including total bacteria, methanogens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus was similar (p>0.05) among dietary treatments (p>0.05); however, copy numbers of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was increased when protein level increased (p<0.05). Microbial protein synthesis, in terms of both quantity and efficiency, was enriched by Mago-pel supplementation. Milk yield was greatest in cows fed UTRS based diets with concentrate containing protein at 16% CP with Mago-pel, but were lowest without Mago-pel (p<0.05). In addition, protein level and supplementation of Mago-pel did not affect (p>0.05) milk composition except solids-not-fat which was higher in cows fed the diet with 19% CP. Therefore, feeding a concentrate containing 16% CP together with 300 g/hd/d Mago-pel supplementation results in changes in rumen fermentation and microbial population and improvements in milk production in lactating dairy crossbreds fed on UTRS.
TI  - Albusin B modulates lipid metabolism and increases antioxidant defense in broiler chickens by a proteomic approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of albusin B on lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense in broiler chickens by a proteomic approach. The bacteriocin, albusin B of Ruminococcus albus 7, expressed by yeast was applied in this study. Three dietary treatments, consisting of the basal diet (control), basal diet + albusin B (2.5 g kg(-)(1)), and basal diet + nosiheptide (2.5 mg kg(-)(1)) were randomly fed to 90 broiler chickens from 1 to 35 days of age, respectively. After 35 days of supplementation, the growth performance, lipid metabolism and antioxidant proteins in the jejunum and liver, intestinal protein profile, and plasma lipid profile were analyzed. RESULTS: Broilers with albusin B supplementation had greater body weight than the control broilers. Compared with the control broilers, lower triglyceride and higher high-density lipoprotein concentration in the blood were observed in both broilers with albusin B and nosiheptide supplementation. In addition, albusin B suppressed the mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein 2 and ATP binding cassette transporter G 5 in the jejunum. In the jejunal protein profiles, four antioxidant proteins were upregulated by albusin B and nosiheptide treatments. The jejunal antioxidant gene expression had a concordant pattern. Hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase, and superoxide dismutase were upregulated by albusin B supplementation. CONCLUSION: Albusin B supplementation modulated lipid metabolism and activated systemic antioxidant defense, which might partially contribute to the performance of broiler chickens.
TI  - Effects of hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial community in an artificial rumen (rusitec).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in the use of hops (Humulus lupulus) as an alternative to antibiotics to manipulate ruminal fermentation. However, the effects of different hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations have not been studied. Here the effects of three hop varieties, Cascade (CAS), Millennium (MIL) and Teamaker (TM), at a level of 800 microg mL(-1) inoculum on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system (rusitec) fed a barley silage-based total mixed ration were investigated. Bacterial populations were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies. RESULTS: All hops reduced (P < 0.001) total gas, methane and the acetate:propionate ratio. Liquid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Streptococcus bovis were reduced (P < 0.05) by MIL and TM. Feed particle-associated S. bovis was reduced (P < 0.01) by MIL and TM, but TM and CAS increased (P < 0.01) Ruminobacter amylophilus and Prevotella bryantii respectively. Methanogens were decreased (P < 0.05) by MIL in both liquid and solid fractions and by CAS in the solid fraction. The total amount of alpha- and beta-acids in hops affected the ruminal fermentation. CONCLUSION: Hop-induced changes in fermentation and microbial populations may improve energy efficiency use in the rumen. Further research is needed to determine the effects of hops on in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations and animal performance.
TI  - Effect of phenotypic residual feed intake and dietary forage content on the rumen microbial community of beef cattle.
AB  - Feed-efficient animals have lower production costs and reduced environmental impact. Given that rumen microbial fermentation plays a pivotal role in host nutrition, the premise that rumen microbiota may contribute to host feed efficiency is gaining momentum. Since diet is a major factor in determining rumen community structure and fermentation patterns, we investigated the effect of divergence in phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI) on ruminal community structure of beef cattle across two contrasting diets. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to profile the rumen bacterial population and to quantify the ruminal populations of Entodinium spp., protozoa, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella brevis, the genus Prevotella, and fungi in 14 low (efficient)- and 14 high (inefficient)-RFI animals offered a low-energy, high-forage diet, followed by a high-energy, low-forage diet. Canonical correspondence and Spearman correlation analyses were used to investigate associations between physiological variables and rumen microbial structure and specific microbial populations, respectively. The effect of RFI on bacterial profiles was influenced by diet, with the association between RFI group and PCR-DGGE profiles stronger for the higher forage diet. qPCR showed that Prevotella abundance was higher (P < 0.0001) in inefficient animals. A higher (P < 0.0001) abundance of Entodinium and Prevotella spp. and a lower (P < 0.0001) abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes were observed when animals were offered the low-forage diet. Thus, differences in the ruminal microflora may contribute to host feed efficiency, although this effect may also be modulated by the diet offered.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Effects of essential oils on methane production and fermentation by, and abundance and diversity of, rumen microbial populations.
AB  - Five essential oils (EOs), namely, clove oil (CLO), eucalyptus oil (EUO), garlic  oil (GAO), origanum oil (ORO), and peppermint oil (PEO), were tested in vitro at 3 different doses (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 g/liter) for their effect on methane production, fermentation, and select groups of ruminal microbes, including total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, archaea, and protozoa. All the EOs significantly reduced methane production with increasing doses, with reductions by 34.4%, 17.6%, 42.3%, 87%, and 25.7% for CLO, EUO, GAO, ORO, and PEO, respectively, at 1.0 g/liter compared with the control. However, apparent degradability of dry matter and neutral detergent fiber also decreased linearly with increasing doses by all EOs except GAO. The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids were not affected by GAO, EUO, or PEO but altered linearly and quadratically by CLO and ORO, respectively. All the EOs also differed in altering the molar proportions of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, all the EOs decreased the abundance of archaea, protozoa, and major cellulolytic bacteria (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and R. albus) linearly with increasing EO doses. On the basis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, different EOs changed the composition of both archaeal and bacterial communities to different extents. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was reduced for archaea by all EOs in a dose-dependent manner but increased for bacteria at low and medium doses (0.25 and 0.50 g/liter) for all EOs except ORO. Due to the adverse effects on feed digestion and fermentation at high doses, a single EO may not effectively and practically mitigate methane emission from ruminants unless used at low doses in combinations with other antimethanogenic compounds.
TI  - Catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from Neocallimastix patriciarum J11.
AB  - Four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, EC 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bglA13, bglA16, bglA51, and bglM2, were found in the cDNA library of Neocallimastix patriciarum J11. All were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to Streptococcus equinus. The presence of expansion and several predicted secondary structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of bglA16 and bglM2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bglA13 and bglA16, which contain very short 3'UTRs, were replicated earlier. These findings indicate that the beta-glucanase genes from N. patriciarum J11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-Glucanase genes of Streptococcus equinus, Ruminococcus albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were cloned and expressed by Escherichia coli. The recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from S. equinus, R. albus 7, and N. patriciarum J11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. The specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. Our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. The specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 U/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. They also demonstrated similar pH and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. Nevertheless, BglA16 and BglM2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. These results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bglA16 and bglM2, increase the reaction efficiency of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in N. patriciarum J11.
TI  - Enzymatic characteristics of cellobiose phosphorylase from Ruminococcus albus NE1 and kinetic mechanism of unusual substrate inhibition in reverse phosphorolysis.
AB  - Cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of cellobiose to produce alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate (Glc1P) and D-glucose. It is an essential enzyme for the metabolism of cello-oligosaccharides in a ruminal bacterium, Ruminococcus albus. In this study, recombinant R. albus CBP (RaCBP) produced in Escherichia coli was characterized. It showed highest activity at pH 6.2 at 50 degrees C, and was stable in a pH range of 5.5-8.8 and at below 40 degrees C. It phosphorolyzed only cellobiose efficiently, and the reaction proceeded through a random-ordered bi bi mechanism, by which inorganic phosphate and cellobiose bind in random order and D-glucose is released before Glc1P. In the synthetic reaction, RaCBP showed highest activity to D-glucose, followed by 6-deoxy-D-glucose. D-Mannose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-glucosamine, D-xylose, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, and gentiobiose also served as acceptors, although the activities for them were much lower than for D-glucose. D-Glucose acted as a competitive-uncompetitive inhibitor of the reverse synthetic reaction, which bound not only the Glc1P site (competitive) but also the ternary enzyme-Glc1P-D-glucose complex (uncompetitive).
TI  - Microbial population in the rumen of swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as influenced by coconut oil and mangosteen peel supplementation.
AB  - Four, rumen fistulated swamp buffalo bulls were used to study microbial populations in the rumen when supplemented with coconut oil and mangosteen peel. Animals were randomly assigned to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Four treatments were un-supplemented (Control), supplementation with coconut oil at 50 g/kg (CO5), supplementation with mangosteen peel at 30 g/kg (MP3) and supplementation with CO5 and MP3 (COM), of total DM intake. Animals received concentrate at 10 g/kg of BW, and rice straw was given ad libitum. Abundance of total bacteria was increased by CO5 supplementation, whereas populations of protozoa and Fibrobacter succinogenes were reduced by CO5 and COM supplementation. Dietary supplementation did not affect methanogen, Ruminococcus flavefaciens or Ruminococcus albus abundances. Dietary treatments changed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns of methanogens and protozoa when compared with the control group, especially when supplemented with MP3. Supplementation of COM resulted in the greatest difference in pattern of DGGE bands for total bacteria compared with the control. Coconut oil and mangosteen peel supplementation resulted in changing of rumen microbial abundances and communities; however, combination of them could be more benefit to improve rumen fermentation of swamp buffalo fed on rice straw.
TI  - Production and characterization of a bacteriocin from ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7.
AB  - The characteristics of a bacteriocin from Ruminococcus albus 7 and its potential  as an antibiotic alternative were examined in this study. The addition of 3 microM 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) and 0.2% Tween 80 to the culturing medium improved bacteriocin production by 2.5-fold. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the antagonistically active gel filtration fraction established that the molecular weight of the R. albus 7 bacteriocin was approximately 36 kDa. The bacteriocin was sensitive to pepsin, protease, and pancreatin, and was inactivated by heating at 65 degrees C for 1 h. Simulating in vitro avian digestion decreased the antagonistic activity by 74.7%, but the addition of 1% bovin serum albumin restored 13% of the lost antagonistic activity. Following ion-exchange purification, the bacteriocin had sufficient antagonistic activity against five tested pathogenic strains, but the addition of a protectant is necessary for utilization of bacteriocin of R. albus 7 as an antibiotic alternative in animal feed.
TI  - In situ identification of carboxymethyl cellulose-digesting bacteria in the rumen of cattle fed alfalfa or triticale.
AB  - A method was developed and used to arrest and stain reducing sugars (glucose) produced by bacteria with cell-surface-associated carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) and endoglucanase activities (CMC bacteria) in the rumen of cows fed alfalfa or triticale. Precipitation of silver oxide on the surface of individual cells was observed using cellulolytic bacterial pure cultures with known CMCase activity and rumen mixed cultures. The CMC bacteria in the liquid and solid fractions of the rumen digesta were identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with currently available and newly designed oligonucleotide probes. The CMC bacteria contributed between 8.2% and 10.1% to the total bacterial cell numbers. Most of the CMC bacteria (75.2-78.5%) could be identified by FISH probing. The known cellulolytic populations Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes constituted 44.5-53.1% of the total. Other CMC bacteria identified hybridized with the probe Clo549 (11.2-23.0%) targeting members of an uncharacterized genus in Clostridia, the probe Inc852 (8.9-10.7%) targeting members of the family Incertae Sedis III and unclassified Clostridiales, and the probe But1243 (< 1%) designed against members of genus Butyrivibrio. Different forage feeds had no marked effects on the percentage abundances of these identified CMC bacteria. All appeared to be involved in cellulose degradation in the rumen of cows fed either alfalfa or triticale.
TI  - Effects of chestnut tannins and coconut oil on growth performance, methane emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of chestnut tannins (CT) and coconut oil (CO) on growth performance, methane (CH(4)) emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep. A total of 48 Rideau Arcott sheep (average body weight 31.5+/-1.97 kg, 16 wk old) were randomly assigned into 6 treatment groups in a 3 x 2 factorial design, with CT and CO as the main effects (8 sheep per group). The treatments were control diet (CTR), 10 or 30 g of CT/kg of diet (CT10 and CT30), 25 g of CO/kg of concentrate (CO25), and 10 or 30 g of CT/kg of diet+25 g of CO/kg of concentrate (CT10CO25 and CT30CO25). After the feeding trial (60 d), all sheep were moved to respiratory chambers to measure CH(4) emission. After CH(4) emission measurements, all sheep were slaughtered to obtain rumen fluid samples. Results showed that the addition of CT, CO, and CT+CO had no significant effects on growth performance of sheep but reduced CH(4) emission. Addition of CT reduced the NH(3)-N concentration in rumen fluid in CT30. Addition of CO decreased the concentration of total volatile fatty acids in rumen fluid. No significant differences were observed in pH and molar proportion of volatile fatty acids among treatments. Addition of CT, CO, and CT+CO significantly decreased methanogen and protozoa populations. Moreover, CO decreased counts of Fibrobacter succinogenes. No significant differences were observed in populations of fungi, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, or Ruminococcus albus among treatments. In conclusion, supplementation of CT and CO seemed to be a feasible means of decreasing emissions of CH(4) from sheep by reduction of methanogen and protozoa populations with no negative effect on growth performance.
TI  - Responses in digestion, rumen fermentation and microbial populations to inhibition of methane formation by a halogenated methane analogue.
AB  - The effects of the anti-methanogenic compound, bromochloromethane (BCM), on rumen microbial fermentation and ecology were examined in vivo. Japanese goats were fed a diet of 50 % Timothy grass and 50 % concentrate and then sequentially adapted to low, mid and high doses of BCM. The goats were placed into the respiration chambers for analysis of rumen microbial function and methane and H2 production. The levels of methane production were reduced by 5, 71 and 91 %, and H2 production was estimated at 545, 2941 and 3496 mmol/head per d, in response to low, mid and high doses of BCM, respectively, with no effect on maintenance feed intake and digestibility. Real-time PCR quantification of microbial groups showed a significant decrease relative to controls in abundance of methanogens and rumen fungi, whereas there were increases in Prevotella spp. and Fibrobacter succinogenes, a decrease in Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens was unchanged. The numbers of protozoa were also unaffected. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that several Prevotella spp. were the bacteria that increased most in response to BCM treatment. It is concluded that the methane-inhibited rumen adapts to high hydrogen levels by shifting fermentation to propionate via Prevotella spp., but the majority of metabolic hydrogen is expelled as H2 gas.
TI  - Effects of nitrate on methane production, fermentation, and microbial populations in in vitro ruminal cultures.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effects of nitrate on methane production, important fermentation characteristics, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, total bacteria, and methanogens using in vitro ruminal cultures. Potential adaptation of the above microbes and persistency of nitrate to mitigate CH4 production were also evaluated. Methane production was reduced by 70% at 12 mumol ml(-1) and nearly completely at >/=24 mumol ml(-1) nitrate. Production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was affected to different extents at different nitrate concentrations. Over a series of six consecutive cultures receiving 12 mumol ml(-1) nitrate, production of CH4 and VFA did not change significantly. R. albus and R. flavefaciens seemed to adapt to nitrate, while F. succinogenes and methanogens did not. Nitrate may be used in achieving persistent mitigation of CH4 production by ruminants.
TI  - Complete genome of the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 7 is a highly cellulolytic ruminal bacterium that is a member  of the phylum Firmicutes. Here, we describe the complete genome of this microbe. This genome will be useful for rumen microbiology and cellulosome biology and in biofuel production, as one of its major fermentation products is ethanol.
TI  - Functional analyses of multiple lichenin-degrading enzymes from the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 8 is a fibrolytic ruminal bacterium capable of utilization of  various plant cell wall polysaccharides. A bioinformatic analysis of a partial genome sequence of R. albus revealed several putative enzymes likely to hydrolyze glucans, including lichenin, a mixed-linkage polysaccharide of glucose linked together in beta-1,3 and beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds. In the present study, we demonstrate the capacity of four glycoside hydrolases (GHs), derived from R. albus, to hydrolyze lichenin. Two of the genes encoded GH family 5 enzymes (Ra0453 and Ra2830), one gene encoded a GH family 16 enzyme (Ra0505), and the last gene encoded a GH family 3 enzyme (Ra1595). Each gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity. Upon screening on a wide range of substrates, Ra0453, Ra2830, and Ra0505 displayed different hydrolytic properties, as they released unique product profiles. The Ra1595 protein, predicted to function as a beta-glucosidase, preferred cleavage of a nonreducing end glucose when linked by a beta-1,3 glycosidic bond to the next glucose residue. The major product of Ra0505 hydrolysis of lichenin was predicted to be a glucotriose that was degraded only by Ra0453 to glucose and cellobiose. Most importantly, the four enzymes functioned synergistically to hydrolyze lichenin to glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose. This lichenin-degrading enzyme mix should be of utility as an additive to feeds administered to monogastric animals, especially those high in fiber.
TI  - Development of a signature probe targeting the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed  spacer of a ruminal Ruminococcus flavefaciens isolate from reindeer.
AB  - The cellulolytic Ruminococcus flavefaciens has previously been introduced into the ruminant rumen to increase microbial degradation of plant cell wall carbohydrates. The functional effect of an introduced bacterium depends on its ability to establish in the digestive tract, and signature probes can be used as a tool to track and quantify introduced strains. The purpose of this current study was to develop an oligonucleotide signature probe targeting the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of a putative probiotic cellulolytic isolate (R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32) from the rumen of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). The 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS of three Ruminococcus strains; R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32, R. flavefaciens FD-1 and Ruminococcus albus Ra-8, was investigated. The ITS region has been reported to vary more between closely related bacteria compared to the widely used 16S rRNA gene, and a high degree of sequence polymorphism was indeed detected between the three Ruminococcus strains studied. Based on observed sequence differences, two oligonucloetide probes, ITSRumi1 and ITSRumi2, targeting the ITS region of the R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 were developed. Probe specificity was evaluated in dot blot hybridisations with R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 and four other Ruminococcus-strains tested. The probe ITSRumi1 gave positive signals for the R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 only, while probe ITSRumi2 gave positive signals for R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 as well as for R. albus Ra-8. The result of hybridisations with the probe ITSRumi1 indicates that the probe is specific for the R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32 amongst the four Ruminococcus-strains tested, and is promising for further studies using it as a signature probe for tracking this strain when re-introduced to the reindeer rumen.
TI  - Populations of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen of sheep and  the effect of diets and ruminal fractions.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the importance of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen by quantifying their populations and the effect of diets and ruminal fractions. Full-length 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences were recovered from rumen samples using specific primers designed from partial sequences recovered previously. Five uncultured bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were quantified using specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) in fractionated ruminal samples from sheep fed either hay alone or hay plus corn. Species Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Mitsuokella multacida and genera Butyrivibrio and Prevotella were also quantified as comparison. The full-length rrs sequence improved taxonomic assignments of partial rrs sequences. Genus Prevotella had the greatest abundance. Of the three major cultured cellulolytic species, R. flavefaciens was most abundant, followed by R. albus and F. succinogenes. The five uncultured bacterial OTUs, classified to genus Acetivibrio, genus Allobaculum, family Ruminococcaceae, order Clostridiales, or class Clostridia, had abundance comparable to that of the above species of genera except Prevotella. Corn supplementation and fractions affected distribution of the rumen bacteria, but to a limited extent. When compared to the qPCR data, sequence frequencies in the rrs clone libraries tended to overestimate the abundance of the bacteria represented. This study showed that abundance and population dynamics of uncultured bacteria can be quantified by specific qPCR, which complements the results of rrs clone libraries. This study also revealed that some uncultured bacteria might be as important as some of the well-characterized bacteria in the rumen. The approach used should be applicable to assess the abundance and potential importance of uncultured bacteria in other environments.
TI  - Nutrient digestibility and ruminal fermentation characteristic in swamp buffaloes fed on chemically treated rice straw and urea.
AB  - The experiment was conducted to determine effects of urea-lime-treated rice straw and urea levels in concentrate on rumen fermentation, apparent nutrient digestibility, and cellulolytic bacteria population of 4-year-old, rumen-fistulated swamp buffaloes. All animals were randomly assigned according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments: factor A, two sources of roughage (rice straw and 2%urea + 2%lime-treated rice straw); factor B, two levels of urea in concentrate mixture (0% and 4%). Roughages were given ad libitum together with 0.3% BW of concentrate. It was found that voluntary feed intake, the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, NDF, acetate, and propionate concentration were significantly increased (P < 0.05) by treated rice straw, while NH(3)-N, BUN, and propionic acid concentration were increased by both factors of treated rice straw and 4% urea in concentrate. The real-time PCR quantification of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus population, and anaerobic fungi were greater (P < 0.05), but the population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, protozoa, and methanogenic bacteria were reduced (P > 0.05) as influenced by treated rice straw and urea level. In conclusion, the combined use of urea-lime-treated rice straw and fed with concentrate (4% urea) could improve rumen ecology, rumen fermentation efficiency, and nutrient digestibility in swamp buffaloes.
TI  - Biochemical analyses of multiple endoxylanases from the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8 and their synergistic activities with accessory hemicellulose-degrading enzymes.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 8 is a ruminal bacterium capable of metabolizing hemicellulose and cellulose, the major components of the plant cell wall. The enzymes that allow this bacterium to capture energy from the two polysaccharides, therefore, have potential application in plant cell wall depolymerization, a process critical to biofuel production. For this purpose, a partial genome sequence of R. albus 8 was generated. The genomic data depicted a bacterium endowed with multiple forms of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. The endoxylanases of R. albus 8 exhibited diverse modular architectures, including incorporation of a catalytic module, a carbohydrate binding module, and a carbohydrate esterase module in a single polypeptide. The accessory enzymes of xylan degradation were a beta-xylosidase, an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase, and an alpha-glucuronidase. We hypothesized that due to the chemical complexity of the hemicellulose encountered in the rumen, the bacterium uses multiple endoxylanases, with subtle differences in substrate specificities, to attack the substrate, while the accessory enzymes hydrolyze the products to simple sugars for metabolism. To test this hypothesis, the genes encoding the predicted endoxylanases were expressed, and the proteins were biochemically characterized either alone or in combination with accessory enzymes. The different endoxylanase families exhibited different patterns of product release, with the family 11 endoxylanases releasing more products in synergy with the accessory enzymes from the more complex substrates. Aside from the insights into hemicellulose degradation by R. albus 8, this report should enhance our knowledge on designing effective enzyme cocktails for release of fermentable sugars in the biofuel industry.
TI  - Molecular diversity of bacteria in Yunnan yellow cattle (Bos taurs) from Nujiang  region, China.
AB  - The rumen content of four Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 OTU (Operational Taxonomy Unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. Similarity analysis revealed that Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 12 sequences (10 OTU) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succiniclasticum ruminis, Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and Prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total OTU). The further 12 sequences (9 OTU) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria Clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, Schwartzia succinivorans, Prevotella ruminicola, Eubacterium ruminantium, Ruminococcus albus, and Clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of the total OTU). The remaining 105 sequences (90 OTU) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total OTU). According to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low G+C subdivision (accounting for 72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively) and CFB subdivision (Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively). Among the examined clones, rare bacteria Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Effects of albusin B (a bacteriocin) of Ruminococcus albus 7 expressed by yeast on growth performance and intestinal absorption of broiler chickens--its potential role as an alternative to feed antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity are considered as potential  alternatives to antibiotics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of albusin B (bacteriocin) of Ruminococcus albus 7 expressed by yeast on the growth performance of broiler chickens. Ninety 1-day-old healthy broiler chickens were randomly divided into three groups: control, albusin B (2.5 g kg(-1)) and nosiheptide (2.5 mg kg(-1), antibiotic control). Growth performance and intestinal functions were measured at 5 weeks of age. RESULTS: Albusin B-supplemented broilers showed increased body weight gain compared with control broilers (54.7 +/- 5.3 vs 48.5 +/- 6.1 g day(-1) per bird, P < 0.05). Broilers supplemented with nosiheptide had a less developed mucosal layer than broilers in the other two groups. Compared with the control group, broilers supplemented with albusin B or nosiheptide showed increased mRNA expression of sGLT1, GLUT2 and PEPT1 in the jejunum (P < 0.05). The faecal Lactobacillus count was higher in the albusin B group than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Albusin B supplementation increased intestinal absorption and elevated the faecal Lactobacillus count, thereby promoting the growth performance of broiler chickens. These improvements resulting from albusin B supplementation provide evidence of potential alternatives to antibiotics in broiler chicken feed.
TI  - The effect of lipid supplements on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters varies with the fatty acid composition.
AB  - A single flow continuous culture fermenter system was used in this study to investigate the influence of dietary lipid supplements varying in their fatty acid content on the DNA concentration of selected rumen bacteria. Four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four periods of 10 d each. Treatment diets were fed at 45 g/d (DM basis) in three equal portions during the day. The diets were: 1) control (CON), 2) control with animal fat source (SAT), 3) control with soybean oil (SBO), and 4) control with fish oil (FO). Lipid supplements were added at 3% of diet DM. The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and acetate were not affected (P>0.05) by lipid supplements. Concentrations of propionate, iso-butyrate, valerate and iso-valerate were highest (P<0.05) with the FO diet compared with the other treatment diets. The concentration of til C18:l (vaccenic acid, VA) in effluents increased (P<0.05) with SBO and FO diets and was highest with the SBO diet. The concentrations of C18:0 in effluents were lowest (P<0.05) for the FO diet compared with the other treatment diets. Concentrations of DNA for Anaerovibrio lipolytica, and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in fermenters were similar (P>0.05) for all diets. The DNA concentrations of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Ruminococcus albus in fermenters were lowest (P<0.05) with the FO diet but were similar (P>0.05) among the other treatment diets. Selenomonas ruminantium DNA concentration in fermenters was highest (P<0.05) with the FO diet. In conclusion, SBO had no effect on bacterial DNA concentrations tested in this study and the VA accumulation in the rumen observed on the FO diet may be due in part to FO influence on B. fibrisolvens, R. albus, and S. ruminantium.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Effects of methanogenic inhibitors on methane production and abundances of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria in in vitro ruminal cultures.
AB  - The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of select antimethanogen compounds on methane production, feed digestion and fermentation, and populations of ruminal bacteria and methanogens using in vitro cultures. Seven compounds, including 2-bromoethanesulphonate (BES), propynoic acid (PA), nitroethane (NE), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (ETB), 2-nitroethanol (2NEOH), sodium nitrate (SN), and ethyl-2-butynote (EB), were tested at a final concentration of 12 mM. Ground alfalfa hay was included as the only substrate to simulate daily forage intake. Compared to no-inhibitor controls, PA, 2NEOH, and SN greatly reduced the production of methane (70 to 99%), volatile fatty acids (VFAs; 46 to 66%), acetate (30 to 60%), and propionate (79 to 82%), with 2NEOH reducing the most. EB reduced methane production by 23% without a significant effect on total VFAs, acetate, or propionate. BES significantly reduced the propionate concentration but not the production of methane, total VFAs, or acetate. ETB or NE had no significant effect on any of the above-mentioned measurements. Specific quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assays showed that none of the inhibitors significantly affected total bacterial populations but that they did reduce the Fibrobacter succinogenes population. SN reduced the Ruminococcus albus population, while PA and 2NEOH increased the populations of both R. albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Archaeon-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that all the inhibitors affected the methanogen population structure, while archaeon-specific qPCR revealed a significant decrease in methanogen population in all treatments. These results showed that EB, ETB, NE, and BES can effectively reduce the total population of methanogens but that they reduce methane production to a lesser extent. The results may guide future in vivo studies to develop effective mitigation of methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Long-term defaunation increases the abundance of cellulolytic ruminococci and methanogens but does not affect the bacterial and methanogen diversity in the rumen of sheep.
AB  - Protozoa are commensal eukaryotes in the rumen of herbivores. Protozoa are large  producers of hydrogen, which is utilized by methanogenic archaea to produce methane, a greenhouse gas. The removal of protozoa from the rumen (defaunation) decreases methanogenesis, but also negatively affects fiber digestion, which is the main function of the rumen. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of long-term defaunation on the structure of the microbiota and particularly methanogenic archaea and fibrolytic bacteria to better understand the microbial mechanisms responsible for the decrease in methanogenesis and fibrolysis. The trial was conducted in 5 adult sheep subjected successively to long-term defaunation (2 yr), refaunation (12 wk), and short-term defaunation (10 wk). Methanogens were enumerated by quantitative PCR targeting the rrs (16S ribosomal RNA subunit) and mcrA (methyl coenzyme-M reductase) genes. The rrs gene was used to quantify the 3 major culturable rumen cellulolytic bacterial species (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and total bacteria. Bacterial and methanogen diversity was also examined by PCR-DGGE (PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis targeting the rrs and mcrA genes, respectively. Total rumen bacterial density estimated as rrs copies per gram of DM of rumen content increased in response to long- and short-term defaunation (+1 log, P < 0.001), but without noticeable shifts in diversity. Defaunation increased the rrs copies per gram of DM of rumen content of R. albus and R. flavefaciens (+2 log, P < 0 0.001), but did not affect that of F. succinogenes. Despite a 20% reduction in methane emission in the 2 defaunated periods, the mcrA and rrs copies of methanogens per gram of DM of rumen content increased (+1 log, P < 0.001) in the absence of protozoa, whereas the diversity of the dominant methanogenic community was not modified. This study shows no major difference between long- and short-term defaunation in abundance and diversity of bacteria and archaea. It also provides evidence that monitoring the abundance and diversity of methanogens is not sufficient to comprehend the microbial mechanisms leading to a reduction in methane emissions by ruminants. This study also reports for the first time in sheep a selective effect of defaunation on the abundance of cellulolytic bacterial species.
TI  - Effect of incremental levels of fish oil supplementation on specific bacterial populations in bovine ruminal fluid.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of incremental replacement of dietary linoleic acid by >20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on changes in population of ruminal micro-organisms associated with fibre digestion and biohydrogenation using real-time PCR of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Four beef steers with ruminal cannulas were randomly assigned to control (CK, 65:35 forage to concentrate), CK with 3% sunflower oil plus 1% fish oil (S3F1), 2.5% sunflower oil plus 1.5% fish oil (S2.5F1.5) or 2% sunflower oil plus 2% fish oil (S2F2) in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-day periods. Ruminal fluid was collected on day 15 of each period. Compared with CK, oil addition led to lower ruminal acetate and butyrate but greater propionate concentration. DNA copy number of Anaerovibrio lipolytica in ruminal fluid was greater with oil (average 5.38 vs. 3.62 x 10(5) DNA copy number), particularly with S2F2 relative to CK. Fibrobacter succinogenes and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens DNA copy number decreased by 74% (1.06 vs. 4.01 x 10(5)) and 39% (5.16 vs. 8.42 x 10(7)) in response to S2F2 compared with CK. DNA copy numbers of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by incremental fish oil. Results suggest that greater availability of PUFA with >20 carbons (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) promoted changes in bacterial populations that are relevant for fibre digestion and biohydrogenation.
TI  - Influence of the composition of the cellulolytic flora on the development of hydrogenotrophic microorganisms, hydrogen utilization, and methane production in the rumens of gnotobiotically reared lambs.
AB  - We investigated the influence of the composition of the fibrolytic microbial community on the development and activities of hydrogen-utilizing microorganisms in the rumens of gnotobiotically reared lambs. Two groups of lambs were reared. The first group was inoculated with Fibrobacter succinogenes, a non-H(2)-producing species, as the main cellulolytic organism, and the second group was inoculated with Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and anaerobic fungi that produce hydrogen. The development of hydrogenotrophic bacterial communities, i.e., acetogens, fumarate and sulfate reducers, was monitored in the absence of methanogens and after inoculation of methanogens. Hydrogen production and utilization and methane production were measured in rumen content samples incubated in vitro in the presence of exogenous hydrogen (supplemented with fumarate or not supplemented with fumarate) or in the presence of ground alfalfa hay as a degradable substrate. Our results show that methane production was clearly reduced when the dominant fibrolytic species was a non-H(2)-producing species, such as Fibrobacter succinogenes, without significantly impairing fiber degradation and fermentations in the rumen. The addition of fumarate to the rumen contents stimulated H(2) utilization only by the ruminal microbiota inoculated with F. succinogenes, suggesting that these communities could play an important role in fumarate reduction in vivo.
TI  - The effect of replacing corn with glycerol on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters.
AB  - The effects of substituting corn with glycerol on DNA concentration of selected ruminal bacteria were investigated using continuous fermenters. Four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 Latin Square design with four 10 days consecutive periods. Treatment diets (60:40 forage to concentrate) were fed at 45 g/day dry matter (DM) in three equal portions. Glycerol (0.995 g/g glycerol) was used to replace corn in a grain mix at proportions of 0% (T0; control), 15% (T15), 30% (T30) and 45% (T45). On day 10 of each period, samples were collected from each fermenter 3 h after the morning feeding and analysed for volatile fatty acid and bacterial DNA concentration. Glycerol substitution was related to significantly higher butyrate, valerate and isovalerate concentrations. Compared with the T0 diet, acetate concentration was significantly lower with the T30 and T45 diets whilst propionate concentration was higher only with the T45 diet. The DNA concentrations for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Selenomonas ruminantium decreased with the T30 and T45 diets compared with the T0 diet. No differences in the DNA concentrations for Ruminococcus albus and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens amongst diets were observed. The findings show that substituting 15% of the dietary corn with glycerol had no substantive effects on fermentation processing or ruminal bacteria. Higher substitution levels, however, may adversely affect ruminal bacteria and negatively impact acetate production.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Influence of the maize silage to grass silage ratio and feed particle size of rations for ruminants on the community structure of ruminal Firmicutes in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of the forage source and feed particle size (FPS) in ruminant rations on the composition of the ruminal Firmicutes community in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three diets, varying in maize silage to grass silage ratio and FPS, were incubated in a rumen simulation system. Microbial samples were taken from the liquid fermenter effluents. Microbial community analysis was performed by 16S rRNA-based techniques. Clostridia-specific single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles revealed changes of the community structure in dependence on both factors tested. The coarse grass silage-containing diets seemed to enhance the occurrence of different Roseburia species. As detected by real-time quantitative PCR, Ruminococcus albus showed a higher abundance with decreasing FPS. A slightly lower proportion of Bacilli was found with increasing grass silage to maize silage ratio by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In contrast, a slightly higher proportion of bacterial species belonging to the Clostridium-clusters XIV a and b was detected by FISH with increasing grass silage contents in the diet. CONCLUSIONS: The ruminal Firmicutes community is affected by the choice of the forage source and FPS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study supplies fundamental knowledge about the response of ruminal microbial communities to changing diets. Moreover, the data suggest a standardization of grinding of feeds for in vitro studies to facilitate the comparison of results of different laboratories.
TI  - Practical preparation of epilactose produced with cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus NE1.
AB  - A practical purification method for a non-digestible disaccharide, epilactose (4-O-beta-galactosyl-D-mannose), was established. Epilactose was synthesized from lactose with cellobiose 2-epimerase and purified by the following procedure: (i) removal of lactose by crystallization, (ii) hydrolysis of lactose by beta-galactosidase, (iii) digestion of monosaccharides by yeast, and (iv) column chromatography with Na-form cation exchange resin. Epilactose of 91.1% purity was recovered at 42.5% yield.
TI  - Forage type and fish oil cause shifts in rumen bacterial diversity.
AB  - Despite evidence supporting improved incorporation of beneficial polyunsaturated  fatty acids (PUFA) into ruminant products, such as meat and milk, following red clover and fish oil (FO) inclusion in the ruminant diet, little is known regarding the concomitant bacterial diversity. We evaluated the effects of feeding grass vs. red clover silage with incremental FO inclusion on known lipolytic, biohydrogenating, cellulolytic and proteolytic rumen bacterial communities of steers. Following 14 days of dietary adaptation, liquid-associated (LAB) and solid-associated (SAB) bacterial communities were harvested, DNA extracted and bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and specific-bacterial quantitative PCR (QPCR) were undertaken. DGGE-derived dendrograms showed that diet caused the greatest change in LAB and SAB bacterial diversity, with FO inclusion at the 2% and 3% dry matter intake also causing some changes. QPCR revealed that diet resulted in changes in the DNA concentration of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, the Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. FO inclusion caused changes in A. lipolytica, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens DNA concentration only. In the B. proteoclasticus group, which are the only known bacteria with the capacity to biohydrogenate PUFA to 18:0, DNA concentration did not correlate to 18:0 flow to the duodenum, however, suggesting that other bacteria may play a role in biohydrogenation. A greater understanding of microbial changes that accompany beneficial dietary changes will lead to novel strategies to improve ruminant product quality.
TI  - Associative effects of supplementing rice straw-based diet with cornstarch on intake, digestion, rumen microbes and growth performance of Huzhou lambs.
AB  - Thirty-six male Hu lambs consuming a rice straw-based diet were used in a 60-day  trial to study the associative effects of cornstarch supplementation on intake, digestion, ruminal microbial population and growth performance. All animals were fed rice straw ad libitum together with 160 g/day of rapeseed meal and supplemented with cornstarch at levels of 0 (control), 60, 120 or 180 g/day, respectively. Increment of supplementary cornstarch showed little influence on rice straw intake. Optimal growth performance and highest apparent digestibility of organic matter was achieved in the 120 g/day cornstarch group (P < 0.05), while the digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein were significantly decreased by 180 g/day cornstarch (P < 0.05). Similar results were observed for carboxymethyl cellulose activity and relative populations of cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogene). Blood urea nitrogen was reduced by supplementary cornstarch, indicating enhanced protein utilization efficiency. Carcass traits were all significantly improved by supplementary cornstarch. These results suggested that proper amounts of starch supplementation (within 0.5% BW) has little adverse effect on forage utilization, but could effectively improve growth performance. High levels of cornstarch, however, would decrease cellulase activity and populations of cellulolytic bacteria, and hence the digestibility of forage.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - Soybean oil and linseed oil supplementation affect profiles of ruminal microorganisms in dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal microorganisms and fermentation parameters due to dietary supplementation of soybean and linseed oil alone or in combination. Four dietary treatments were tested in a Latin square designed experiment using four primiparous rumen-cannulated dairy cows. Treatments were control (C, 60 : 40 forage to concentrate) or C with 4% soybean oil (S), 4% linseed oil (L) or 2% soybean oil plus 2% linseed oil (SL) in a 4 x 4 Latin square with four periods of 21 days. Forage and concentrate mixtures were fed at 0800 and 2000 h daily. Ruminal fluid was collected every 2 h over a 12-h period on day 19 of each experimental period and pH was measured immediately. Samples were prepared for analyses of concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) by GLC and ammonia. Counts of total and individual bacterial groups (cellulolytic, proteolytic, amylolytic bacteria and total viable bacteria) were performed using the roll-tube technique, and protozoa counts were measured via microscopy in ruminal fluid collected at 0, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. Content of ruminal digesta was obtained via the rumen cannula before the morning feeding and used immediately for DNA extraction and quantity of specific bacterial species was obtained using real- time PCR. Ruminal pH did not differ but total VFA (110 v. 105 mmol/l) were lower (P < 0.05) with oil supplementation compared with C. Concentration of ruminal NH3-N (4.4 v. 5.6 mmol/l) was greater (P < 0.05) due to oil compared with C. Compared with C, oil supplementation resulted in lower (P < 0.05) cellulolytic bacteria (3.25 x 108 v. 4.66 x 108 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml) and protozoa (9.04 x 104 v. 12.92 x 104 cell/ml) colony counts. Proteolytic bacteria (7.01 x 108 v. 6.08 x 108 CFU/ml) counts, however, were greater in response to oil compared with C (P < 0.05). Among oil treatments, the amount of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in ruminal fluid was substantially lower (P < 0.05) when L was included. Compared to C, the amount of Ruminococcus albus decreased by an average of 40% regardless of oil level or type. Overall, the results indicate that some ruminal microorganisms, except proteolytic bacteria, are highly susceptible to dietary unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, particularly when linolenic acid rich oils were fed. Dietary oil effects on ruminal fermentation parameters seemed associated with the profile of ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Detection of fiber-digesting bacteria in the ceca of ostrich using specific primer sets.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect three fibrolytic bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus, in the cecal digesta of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) by PCR using a species-specific primer set for each 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA). Although amplified DNA fragments obtained from each primer set had the expected size, the clone library derived from the amplimer contained non-specific sequences. The F. succinogenes-specific primer set recovered a partial 16S rDNA sequence of an uncultivated Fibrobacter with low similarity (<95%) and distantly related phylogenetic positioning to Fibrobacter sequences deposited in the databases, indicating a novel species of Fibrobacter. The sequence was considered to be identical to a clone detected in our previous experiment. Thus, we confirm that the gastrointestinal tract of the ostrich is one of the habitats of Fibrobacter species. The clone library derived from the R. flavefaciens-specific primer set contained a 16S rDNA sequence with 97% similarity to R. flavefaciens, indicating it could be one of a major fibrolytic bacterium in the ostrich ceca. No R. albus 16S rDNA sequence was found in the clone library of the R. albus-specific primer set.
TI  - Ionized calcium requirement of rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Ionized calcium (Ca(+2)) appears to be required by the 3 predominant species of rumen cellulolytic bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. The present study evaluated the role of ionized calcium in growth and cellulose digestion. Maximum growth or rate and extent of digestion and lag time were the criteria used to evaluate Ca(+2) requirements. All cultures except F. succinogenes A3c grew when repeatedly transferred in a medium without added Ca(+2). As Ca(+2) concentration increased in cellobiose medium, the rate of growth increased and lag time decreased for F. succinogenes A3c, whereas F. succinogenes S85 exhibited increases in both maximum growth and rate of growth. No responses in any of the criteria were observed for the ruminococci in cellobiose medium. Both strains of F. succinogenes had an absolute requirement for Ca(+2) with cellulose as the only substrate. For strain A3c the requirement was 0.36 to 0.42 mM and for S85, >0.64 mM. Increases in extent of cellulose degradation occurred with all strains of ruminococci as Ca(+2) concentration increased; however, degradation in Ca(+2)-free medium was similar to that of F. succinogenes with Ca(+2). Although the ruminococci presumably have cellulosomes that require Ca(+2) in their structure, such was not evident in our studies. The function of Ca(+2) in cellulose degradation by F. succinogenes is unknown, but may be related to the secretion or activation of their cellulolytic enzymes. Based on reported concentrations of Ca(+2) in the rumen, it seems unlikely that an in vivo deficiency would occur for these bacteria.
TI  - Valorisation of wastepaper using the fibrolytic/hydrogen producing bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the biotransformation of different kinds of wastepaper to hydrogen by the fibrotylic bacterium Ruminococcus albus. Five different types i.e. paper tissue, office paper, illustrated magazine paper, paperboard and newspaper, were selected as representatives of the most common types of wastepaper found in municipal solid wastes. The percentage of total carbohydrates measured as glucose equivalents, ranged from 50% to 100% (w/w), whereas the bioconversion by R. albus ranged from 18% to 100% of their initial weigh. The only metabolic products detected in all cases were acetate, ethanol, formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen yields ranged from 46 to 280 L H(2)/kg paper, indicating that wastepaper could be a promising candidate for second generation biohydrogen production. Subsequently, hydrolysis was investigated for paper tissue and paperboard. It was shown that in both cases the degradation process could be satisfactory described by zero order kinetics and it was identified to be the rate limiting step for the whole process, controlling biomass growth and metabolites generation rate.
TI  - Differential translocation of green fluorescent protein fused to signal sequences of Ruminococcus albus cellulases by the Tat and Sec pathways of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus is a Gram-positive bacterium that degrades plant cell walls in the rumen of herbivores. It was described to synthesize two major glycoside-hydrolases (Cel9B and Cel48A), which are exported and anchored at the cell surface. In bacteria, proteins destined to cross the cytoplasmic membrane are synthesized as precursors and possess a signal sequence (SS) directing them to the 'Sec' (general secretory) or 'Tat' (twin arginine translocation) pathway. SS composition of Cel9B and Cel48A suggests that these two enzymes translocate using different secretory pathways. In order to confirm this hypothesis, the SSs of Cel9B and Cel48A were fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in wild-type Escherichia coli and in its Tat and Sec isogenic mutants. The SS cleavage and the formation of the mature protein were then followed by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy. This study shows that the SS of Cel9B directs the preprotein to the 'Tat' translocation pathway while the GFP fused to the SS of Cel48A is exported through the 'Sec' machinery. These observations suggest that R. albus possess a Tat pathway, in addition to the general secretory pathway.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of possible catalytic residues of cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus (RaCE) catalyzes the epimerization of cellobiose and lactose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose and 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose (epilactose). Based on the sequence alignment with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerases of known structure and on a homology-modeled structure of RaCE, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of possible catalytic residues in the enzyme, and the mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli cells. We found that R52, H243, E246, W249, W304, E308, and H374 were absolutely required for the activity of RaCE. F114 and W303 also contributed to catalysis. These residues protruded into the active-site cleft in the model (alpha/alpha)(6) core barrel structure.
TI  - Proteomic identification of CBM37-containing cellulases produced by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus 20 and their putative involvement in bacterial adhesion to cellulose.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and characterize other proteins than  fimbrial proteins potentially involved in R. albus 20 adhesion to cellulose using an adhesion-related antiserum preparation (i.e. anti-Adh serum). From protein fractions of R. albus 20 grown on cellulose, the serum recognized at least 10 cellulose-binding proteins (CBPs), among which homologs of glycoside hydrolases (family 5, 9 and 48) of R. albus 8 (i.e. Cel5G, Cel9B and Cel48A) were identified by a proteomic approach. In strain 20, Cel9B and Cel48A were identified as two major CBPs and as bacterial cell-associated proteins. The anti-Adh serum was also shown to target the C-terminal family 37 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM37) of Cel9B and Cel48A, indicating that this module, unique to R. albus, may play a significant role in bacterial adhesion to cellulose as suggested previously for R. albus 8. Overall, our results support the hypothesis of an adhesion mechanism involving the CBM37 of Cel9B and Cel48A. This adhesion mechanism may not be restricted to these two enzymes but may also involve other CBM37-containing proteins such as Cel5G and the other uncharacterised proteins recognized by the anti-Adh serum.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Molecular properties and transcriptional control of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK; EC 4.1.1.32) in Ruminococcus albus were examined. The putative 537-amino acid PCK polypeptide has a predicted mass of 59.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.82. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses of pck mRNA suggest that the transcript is monocistronic and that pck transcription is not affected by changes in sugar sources present in growth medium. PCK enzymatic activity requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) and an optimal pH of 7.0. R. albus PCK phosphorylated ADP more readily than GDP. Apparent K ( m ) values of PCK for PEP and ADP were considerably lower than those for OAA and ATP, suggesting that the reaction from PEP to OAA is favored in R. albus. The enzyme properties of PCK in R. albus appear to be more similar to Selenomonas ruminantium PCK than to Ruminococcus flavefacience, although R. albus and R. flavefacience belong to the same genus. The specific activity of PCK, representing the amount of enzyme per cell, in R. albus was much lower than that in S. ruminantium. The amount of succinate produced in R. albus from one unit of cellobiose was also much lower than the sum of succinate and propionate produced in S. ruminantium. Based on these results, we propose enhancement of PCK activity by stimulating PCK transcription as a method to decrease R. albus H(2) production without suppressing growth.
TI  - Prebiotic properties of epilactose.
AB  - We recently reported that cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus effectively converted lactose to epilactose. In this study, we examined the biological effects of epilactose on intestinal microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and postadministrative plasma glucose by animal tests. Dietary supplementation with epilactose or fructooligosaccharide (4.5% each) increased cecal wall weight and cecal contents and decreased the pH of the cecal contents in Wistar-ST rats. The number of total anaerobes tended to be greater in rats fed epilactose and fructooligosaccharide than in those fed the control diet. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were more numerous in rats fed epilactose and fructooligosaccharide diets than in those fed the control diet. Analysis of clone libraries of 16S rRNA suggests that supplementation with epilactose did not induce the proliferation of harmful bacteria belonging to classes Clostridia or Bacteroidetes. Epilactose, as well as fructooligosaccharide, inhibited the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids, which are suggested to be promoters of colon cancer. In addition, oral administration of epilactose did not elevate the plasma glucose concentration in ddY mice. These results clearly indicate that epilactose is a promising prebiotic. We also showed that cellobiose 2-epimerase converted lactose in cow milk and a spray-dried ultrafiltrate of cheese whey to epilactose. Cellobiose 2-epimerase may increase the value of dairy products by changing lactose to epilactose possessing prebiotic properties.
TI  - Use of real-time PCR technique in studying rumen cellulolytic bacteria population as affected by level of roughage in swamp buffalo.
AB  - A real-time polymerase chain reaction approach was used in this study to determine the population of major ruminal bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) in digesta and rumen fluid of swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Four rumen-fistulated, male swamp buffalo were randomly assigned according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design to evaluate the effect of the urea-treated rice straw (roughage source)-to-concentrate ratio on cellulolytic bacterial distribution. Animals were fed roughage-to-concentrate (R:C) ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75, respectively. At the end of each period, rumen fluid and digesta were collected at 0 h and 4 h post-morning-feeding. It was found that feeding urea-treated rice straw solely increased these three cellulolytic bacteria numbers up to 2.65 x 10(9) and 3.54 x 10(9) copies per milliliter for F. succinogenes, 5.10 x 10(7) and 7.40 x 10(7) copies per milliliter for R. flavefaciens, and 4.00 x 10(6) and 6.00 x 10(6) copies per milliliter for R. albus in rumen fluid and digesta, respectively. The distribution of the three cellulolytic bacteria species in digesta were highest at 3.21 x 10(9), 4.55 x 10(7), and 4.56 x 10(6) copies per milliliter for F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, and R. albus, respectively. Moreover, at 4 h post-morning-feeding, the populations of the three cellulolytic bacteria were higher than found at 0 h post-morning-feeding. It is most notable that F. succinogenes were the highest in population in the rumen of swamp buffalo and cellulolytic bacteria mostly adhered to feed digesta in the rumen.
TI  - Cell surface enzyme attachment is mediated by family 37 carbohydrate-binding modules, unique to Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus binds to and degrades crystalline cellulosic substrates via a unique cellulose degradation system. A unique family of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM37), located at the C terminus of different glycoside hydrolases, appears to be responsible both for anchoring these enzymes to the bacterial cell surface and for substrate binding.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - Effects of epilactose on calcium absorption and serum lipid metabolism in rats.
AB  - Epilactose (4-O-beta-galactopyranosyl-D-mannnose) is a rare disaccharide in cow milk that can be synthesized from lactose by the cellobiose 2-epimerase of Ruminococcus albus. In this study, we examined the biological activities of epilactose using male Wistar-ST rats. The apparent rates of calcium and magnesium absorption of rats fed epilactose and fructooligosaccharide diets were greater than those fed control and lactose diets, accompanied by greater weight gain of the cecal wall and higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and other organic acids. Epilactose also increased the calcium absorption in everted small intestinal sacs. In addition, the levels of plasma total cholesterol and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower in epilactose-fed rats. These results indicate that epilactose promotes calcium absorption in the small intestine and possibly lowers the risk of arteriosclerosis. Cecal microbes may efficiently utilize epilactose and contribute to these biological activities.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in Ruminococcus albus cells. Here, we report a CE in a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. The nucleotide sequence of the CE had an ORF of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 Da). The CE from E. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium phytofermentans, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium siraeum. Surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a CE from R. albus. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees C and pH 7.0-8.5. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose).
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
TI  - NMR study of cellulose and wheat straw degradation by Ruminococcus albus 20.
AB  - Cellulose and wheat straw degradation by Ruminococcus albus was monitored using NMR spectroscopy. In situ solid-state (13)C-cross-polarization magic angle spinning NMR was used to monitor the modification of the composition and structure of cellulose and (13)C-enriched wheat straw during the growth of the bacterium on these substrates. In cellulose, amorphous regions were not preferentially degraded relative to crystalline areas by R. albus. Cellulose and hemicelluloses were also degraded at the same rate in wheat straw. Liquid state two-dimensional NMR experiments were used to analyse in detail the sugars released in the culture medium, and the integration of NMR signals enabled their quantification at various times of culture. The results showed glucose and cellodextrin accumulation in the medium of cellulose cultures; the cellodextrins were mainly cellotriose and accumulated to up to 2 mm after 4 days. In the wheat straw cultures, xylose was the main soluble sugar detected (1.4 mm); arabinose and glucose were also found, together with some oligosaccharides liberated from hemicellulose hydrolysis, but to a much lesser extent. No cellodextrins were detected. The results indicate that this strain of R. albus is unable to use glucose, xylose and arabinose for growth, but utilizes efficiently xylooligosaccharides. R. albus 20 appears to be less efficient than Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 for the degradation of wheat straw.
TI  - Enzymatic properties of cellobiose 2-epimerase from Ruminococcus albus and the synthesis of rare oligosaccharides by the enzyme.
AB  - The gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) from Ruminococcus albus NE1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant CE was purified to homogeneity by a simple purification procedure with a high yield of 88%, and the molecular mass was 43.1 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 44.0 kDa on gel chromatography. It exhibited optimal activity around at 30 degrees C and pH 7.5, and the enzyme activity was inhibited by Al3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ag+, N-bromosuccinimide, iodoacetate, and 4-chloromercuribenzoate. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, the enzyme was found to effectively 2-epimerize lactose to yield 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose (epilactose), which occurs in cow milk as a rare oligosaccharide. The Km and kcat/Km values toward lactose were 33 mM and 1.6 s(-1) mM(-1), and those toward cellobiose were 13.8 mM and 4.6 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively. N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose, D-glucose 6-phosphate, maltose, sophorose, laminaribiose, and gentiobiose were inert as substrates for the recombinant CE. We demonstrated that epilactose was resistant to rat intestinal enzymes, utilized by human adult bifidobacteria, and stimulated the tight junction permeability in Caco-2 cells. These results strongly suggest that this rare disaccharide is promising for use as a prebiotic.
TI  - Quantification by real-time PCR of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen of sheep after supplementation of a forage diet with readily fermentable carbohydrates: effect of a yeast additive.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of concentrate and yeast additive on the number of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen of sheep. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were quantified using real-time PCR (targeting 16S rDNA) in parallel to cellulolytic flora enumeration with cultural techniques. Whatever the conditions tested, R. flavefaciens was slightly more abundant than F. succinogenes, with both species outnumbering R. albus. Before feeding, the shift from hay to hay plus concentrate diet had no effect on rumen pH and on the number of the three specie; while after feeding, the concentrate-supplemented diet induced a decrease (-1 log) of the number of the three species concomitant with the rumen acidification. Overall, the presence of the live yeast resulted in a significant increase (two- to fourfold) of the Ruminococci. CONCLUSION: The use of real-time PCR allowed us to show changes in the number of cellulolytic bacterial species in vivo in response to diet shift and additives that could not be as easily evidenced by classical microbial methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study contributes to the understanding of the negative impact of readily fermentable carbohydrates on rumen cellulolysis and the beneficial effect of yeast on rumen fermentation.
TI  - Effect of sulfur supplements on cellulolytic rumen micro-organisms and microbial  protein synthesis in cattle fed a high fibre diet.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of sulfur-containing compounds on the growth of anaerobic rumen fungi and the fibrolytic rumen bacteria Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes in pure culture and within the cattle rumen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of two reduced sulfur compounds, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid as the sole S source on growth of pure fibroyltic fungal and bacterial cultures showed that these compounds were capable of sustaining growth. An in vivo trial was then conducted to determine the effect of sulfur supplements (MPA and sodium sulfate) on microbial population dynamics in cattle fed the roughage Dichanthium aristatum. Real-time PCR showed significant increases in fibrolytic bacterial and fungal populations when cattle were supplemented with these compounds. Sulfate supplementation leads to an increase in dry matter intake without a change in whole tract dry matter digestibility. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of low S-containing diets with either sodium sulfate or MPA stimulates microbial growth with an increase in rumen microbial protein supply to the animal. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Through the use of real-time PCR monitoring, a better understanding of the effect of S supplementation on discrete microbial populations within the rumen is provided.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the cellobiose 2-epimerase gene from an obligatory anaerobe, Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.11) was first identified in 1967 as an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the reversible epimerization between cellobiose and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in a culture broth of Ruminococcus albus 7 (ATCC 27210(T)). Here, for the first time, we describe the purification of cellobiose 2-epimerase from R. albus NE1. The enzyme was found to 2-epimerize the reducing terminal glucose moieties of cellotriose and cellotetraose in addition to cellobiose. The gene encoding cellobiose 2-epimerase comprises 1170 bp (389 amino acids) and is present as a single copy in the genome. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme contains the possible catalytic residues Arg52, His243, Glu246, and His374. Sequence analysis shows the gene shares a very low level of homology with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerases (EC 5.1.3.8), but no significant homology to any other epimerases reported to date.
TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Studies of the extracellular glycocalyx of the anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7.
AB  - Anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria are thought to adhere to cellulose via several mechanisms, including production of a glycocalyx containing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). As the compositions and structures of these glycocalyces have not been elucidated, variable-pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM) and chemical analysis were used to characterize the glycocalyx of the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus strain 7. VP-SEM revealed that growth of this strain was accompanied by the formation of thin cellular extensions that allowed the bacterium to adhere to cellulose, followed by formation of a ramifying network that interconnected individual cells to one another and to the unraveling cellulose microfibrils. Extraction of 48-h-old whole-culture pellets (bacterial cells plus glycocalyx [G] plus residual cellulose [C]) with 0.1 N NaOH released carbohydrate and protein in a ratio of 1:5. Boiling of the cellulose fermentation residue in a neutral detergent solution removed almost all of the adherent cells and protein while retaining a residual network of adhering noncellular material. Trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis of this residue (G plus C) released primarily glucose, along with substantial amounts of xylose and mannose, but only traces of galactose, the most abundant sugar in most characterized bacterial exopolysaccharides. Linkage analysis and characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that most of the glucosyl units were not present as partially degraded cellulose. Calculations suggested that the energy demand for synthesis of the nonprotein fraction of EPS by this organism represents only a small fraction (<4%) of the anabolic ATP expenditure of the bacterium.
TI  - Unravelling carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria has been investigated essentially in Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. While cellulose depolymerization into soluble sugars by various cellulases is undoubtedly the first step in bacterial metabolisation of cellulose, it is not the only one to consider. Among anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, C. cellulolyticum has been investigated metabolically the most in the past few years. Summarizing metabolic flux analyses in continuous culture using either cellobiose (a soluble cellodextrin resulting from cellulose hydrolysis) or cellulose (an insoluble biopolymer), this review aims to stress the importance of the insoluble nature of a carbon source on bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, some general and specific traits of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria trends, namely, the importance and benefits of (i) cellodextrins with degree of polymerization higher than 2, (ii) intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage, (iii) glycogen cycling on cell bioenergetics, and (iv) carbon overflows in regulation of carbon metabolism, as well as detrimental effects of (i) soluble sugars and (ii) acidic environment on bacterial growth. Future directions for improving bacterial cellulose degradation are discussed.
TI  - In vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  - The role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. Two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94) were used in vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and ruminal H2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H2:CO2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R. albus (P < 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P < 0.05) produced the most H2 among strains and resulted in greater (P < 0.01) CH4 production when cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P < 0.01). Biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.
TI  - Butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  - High concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. The ability of 22 strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (Ruminococcus albus SY3, Ruminococcus flavefaciens RF1,Prevotella ruminicola AR20) and the ruminal phycomycete Neocallimastix patriciarum CX to digest the tropical grass Heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. Significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the B. fibrisolvens strains H17c, A38, LP92-1-1, 49,R. albus SY3 and N. patriciarum. Hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except B. fibrisolvens strains GS113, OB156 and LP1028 and P. ruminicola AR20. The ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different strains of Butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for AR 51 to 0.16 for A38. Butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (H17c and A38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (LP 91-4-1 and AR 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. Cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when Butyrivibrio spp. strains H17c, A38 and E14 and the Ruminococcus spp. were grown on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with N. patriciarum. This is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus Ruminococcus. The fungus N. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. The study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Prokaryote diversity in the rumen of yak (Bos grunniens) and Jinnan cattle (Bos taurus) estimated by 16S rDNA homology analyses.
AB  - Prokaryote diversity in the rumen of yak (Bos grunniens) and Jinnan cattle (Bos taurus) was estimated by 16S rDNA homology analysis. Two rumen 16S rDNA libraries were constructed. Of the 194 clones in the library of yak rumen, the sequences were mainly clustered to two phyla, low G+C Gram-positive bacteria (LGCGPB, 54.12% total clones) and Bacteroidetes (30.93%), respectively. While in the 197 clone-library of the cattle rumen, the sequences were mainly related to three phyla, Bacteroidetes (39.59%), gamma-Proteobacteria (26.9%) and LGCGPB (22.34%), respectively. The sequence analysis indicated that more than half of the species harbored in yak rumen belonged to the not-yet-cultured groups at <90% 16S rDNA similarity levels with cultured species, while 36% 16S rDNA sequences amplified from the rumen of Jinnan cattle fell in these catalogues. By comparing the uncultured sequences in yak rumen with those in Jinnan cattle and cow, the former formed distinct clusters loosely related to the later, implying that yak rumen could harbor some special prokaryote phyla. 10.8% sequences retrieved in yak rumen were related to the known rumen fibrolytic bacterial species; however none was related to the known amylolysis species. While 4% and 17.8% sequences retrieved from Jinnan cattle rumen were related to cultured fibrolytic and amylolysis species, respectively. The bacterial structures seemed to be in accordance with the feed of the two kinds of animals. In both rumens, retrieved methanogenic Archaea-related 16S rDNA sequences were at an unreasonable low level; in addition, none sequence was related to Ruminococcus albus, a classical rumen fibrolytic species. The reason can be due to the experimental biases.
TI  - Assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  - Community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of amplified ribosomal RNA genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. To assess the accuracy of T-RFLP community profiles representing the relative abundance of bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". Template DNA for PCR amplification was generated either by mixing equal quantities of genomic DNA from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to DNA extraction. Pairwise mixtures of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 with Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and Streptococcus bovis JB1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. With genomic DNA mixes, relative abundance calculations based on T-RFLP patterns did not reflect input ratios. These discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rRNA operon copy number. In cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. To determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected PCR product ratios by 6% to 38%. We found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. The unsystematic dependence of T-RFLP peak ratios on variability of DNA extraction and PCR amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of the effects of protozoa on rumen bacteria in cattle.
AB  - A real-time PCR approach was used in this study to clarify the populations of major bacterial species in the rumens of faunated and unfaunated cattle. The sensitivity of this novel real-time PCR assay was evaluated by using 10(1) to 10(8) plasmid copies of target bacteria. The numbers of plasmid copies of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Prevotella ruminicola, and the CUR-E cluster were higher in the unfaunated than in the faunated rumens. The CUR-E cluster belongs to the Clostridium group. In contrast, Fibrobacter succinogenes was higher in the faunated than in the unfaunated rumens. Although it is well known that an absence of protozoa brings about an increase in the bacterial population, it was clarified here that an absence of protozoa exerted differential effects on the populations of cellulolytic bacteria in cattle rumens (i.e., F. succinogenes, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens). In addition, real-time PCR analysis suggested that the CUR-E cluster was more prevalent in the unfaunated rumens.
TI  - The dynamics of major fibrolytic microbes and enzyme activity in the rumen in response to short- and long-term feeding of Sapindus rarak saponins.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the short- and long-term effects of an extract of Sapindus rarak saponins (SE) on the rumen fibrolytic enzyme activity and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two feeding trials were conducted. In the short-term trial, four fistulated goats were fed a basal diet containing sugar cane tops and wheat pollard (65:35, w/w) and were supplemented for 7 days with SE at a level of 0.6 g kg(-1) body weight. Rumen liquor was taken before, during and after SE feeding. In the long-term trial, 28 sheep were fed the same basal diet as the goats and were supplemented for 105 days with 0.24, 0.48 and 0.72 g kg(-1) body mass of the extract. Rumen liquor was taken on days 98 and 100. Protozoal numbers were counted under the microscope. Cell wall degradation was determined by enzyme assays and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms were quantified by dot blot hybridization. Sapindus extract significantly depressed rumen xylanase activity in both trials and carboxymethylcellulase activity in the long-term trial (P < 0.01). Fibrobacter sp. were not affected by the SE in both trials, while ruminococci and the anaerobic fungi showed a short-term response to the application of saponins. Protozoal counts were decreased only in the long-term trial with sheep. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there is an adaptation of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Chytridiomycetes (fungi) to saponin when fed over a long period. The fact that no correlation between the cell wall degrading enzyme activities and the cell wall degrading micro-organisms was observed suggests that the organisms tracked in this experiment are not the only key players in ruminal cell wall degradation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sapindus rarak saponins partially defaunate the rumen flora. Their negative effect on cell wall degradation, however, is not related to rumen organisms currently recognized as the major cell wall degrading species. The adaptation of microbes in the long-term feeding experiment suggests that the results from short-term trial on the ruminal microbial community have to be interpreted carefully.
TI  - Biochemical and mutational analysis of glutamine synthetase type III from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Two different genes encoding glutamine synthetase type I (GSI) and GSIII were identified in the genome sequence of R. albus 8. The identity of the GSIII protein was confirmed by the presence of its associated conserved motifs. The glnN gene, encoding the GSIII, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The recombinant protein was purified and subjected to biochemical and physical analyses. Subunit organization suggested a protein present in solution as both monomers and oligomers. Kinetic studies using the forward and the gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) assays were carried out. Mutations that changed conserved glutamic acid residues to alanine in the four GSIII motifs resulted in drastic decreases in GS activity using both assays, except for an E380A mutation, which rather resulted in an increase in activity in the forward assay compared to the wild-type protein. Reduced GSIII activity was also exhibited by mutating, individually, two lysines (K308 and K318) located in the putative nucleotide-binding site to alanine. Most importantly, the presence of mRNA transcripts of the glnN gene in R. albus 8 cells grown under ammonia limiting conditions, whereas little or no transcript was detected in cells grown under ammonia sufficient conditions, suggested an important role for the GSIII in the nitrogen metabolism of R. albus 8. Furthermore, the mutational studies on the conserved GSIII motifs demonstrated, for the first time, their importance in the structure and/or function of a GSIII protein.
TI  - Expression of a bacterial endoglucanase gene in tobacco increases digestibility of its cell wall fibers.
AB  - Transgenic tobacco plants exhibiting exogenous cellulase activity were produced by introduction of a truncated cellulase (t-EgI) gene from Ruminococcus albus. They accumulated about 0.1-0.5% t-EgI of the total soluble proteins in the cytoplasm. They were normal in morphology and growth. t-EgI expressed in the transgenic plants degraded their own cell wall materials after the cells were disrupted. The plants expressing the t-egI gene could be used as "cellulase-encapsulating plants" for livestock and food industries.
TI  - Naturally occurring DNA transfer system associated with membrane vesicles in cellulolytic Ruminococcus spp. of ruminal origin.
AB  - A genetic transformation system with similarities to those reported for gram-negative bacteria was found to be associated with membrane vesicles of the ruminal cellulolytic genus Ruminococcus. Double-stranded DNA was recovered from the subcellular particulate fraction of all the cellulolytic ruminococci examined. Electron microscopy revealed that the only particles present resembled membrane vesicles. The likelihood that the DNA was associated with membrane vesicles (also known to contain cellulosomes) was further supported by the adherence of the particles associated with the subcellular DNA to cellulose powder added to culture filtrates. The particle-associated DNA comprised a population of linear molecules ranging in size from <20 kb to 49 kb (Ruminococcus sp. strain YE73) and from 23 kb to 90 kb (Ruminococcus albus AR67). Particle-associated DNA from R. albus AR67 represented DNA derived from genomic DNA of the host bacterium having an almost identical HindIII digestion pattern and an identical 16S rRNA gene. Paradoxically, particle-associated DNA was refractory to digestion with EcoRI, while the genomic DNA was susceptible to extensive digestion, suggesting that there is differential restriction modification of genomic DNA and DNA exported from the cell. Transformation using the vesicle-containing fraction of culture supernatant of Ruminococcus sp. strain YE71 was able to restore the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose to two mutants that were otherwise unable to do so. The ability was heritable and transferred to subsequent generations. It appears that membrane-associated transformation plays a role in lateral gene transfer in complex microbial ecosystems, such as the rumen.
TI  - Ethanol production from cellobiose by Zymobacter palmae carrying the Ruminocuccus albus beta-glucosidase gene.
AB  - Its metabolic characteristics suggest Zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov. could serve as a useful new ethanol-fermenting bacterium, but its biotechnological exploitation would require certain genetic improvements. We therefore established a method for transforming Z. palmae using the broad-host vector plasmids pRK290, pMFY31 and pMFY40 as a source of transforming DNA. Using electroporation, the frequency of transformation was 10(5) to 10(6) transformants/mug of DNA. To confer the ability to ferment cellobiose, which is a hydrolysis product from cellulosic materials treated enzymatically or with acid, the beta-glucosidase gene from Ruminococcus albus was introduced into Z. palmae, where its expression was driven by its endogenous promoter. About 56% of the enzyme expressed was localized on the cell-surface or in the periplasm. The recombinant Z. palmae could ferment 2% cellobiose to ethanol, producing 95% of the theoretical yield with no accumulation of organic acids as metabolic by-products. Thus, expression of beta-glucosidase in Z. palmae expanded the substrate spectrum of the strain, enabling ethanol production from cellulosic materials.
TI  - The Ruminococcus albus pilA1-pilA2 locus: expression and putative role of two adjacent pil genes in pilus formation and bacterial adhesion to cellulose.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus produces fimbria-like structures that are involved with the bacterium's adhesion to cellulose. The subunit protein has been identified in strain 8 (CbpC) and strain 20 (GP25) and both are type IV fimbrial (Pil) proteins. The presence of a pil locus that is organized similarly in both strains is reported here together with the results of an initial examination of a second Pil protein. Downstream of the cbpC/gp25 gene (hereafter referred to as pilA1) is a second pilin gene (pilA2). Northern blot analysis of pilA1 and pilA2 transcripts showed that the pilA1 transcript is much more abundant in R. albus 8, and real-time PCR was used to measure pilA1 and pilA2 transcript abundance in R. albus 20 and its adhesion-defective mutant D5. Similar to the findings with R. albus 8, the relative expression of pilA1 in the wild-type strain was 73-fold higher than that of pilA2 following growth with cellobiose, and there were only slight differences between the wild-type and mutant strain in pilA1 and pilA2 transcript abundances, indicating that neither pilA1 nor pilA2 transcription is adversely affected in the mutant strain. Western immunoblots showed that the PilA2 protein is localized primarily to the membrane fraction, and the anti-PilA2 antiserum does not inhibit bacterial adhesion to cellulose. These results suggest that the PilA2 protein plays a role in the synthesis and assembly of type IV fimbriae-like structures by R. albus, but its role is restricted to cell-associated functions, rather than as part of the externalized fimbrial structure.
TI  - Ethanol production from cellulosic materials by genetically engineered Zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  - To confer the ability to ferment cello-oligosaccharides on the ethanol-producing  bacterium, Zymomonas mobilis, the beta-glucosidase gene from Ruminococcus albus, tagged at its N-terminal with the 53-amino acid Tat signal peptide from the periplasmic enzyme glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Z. mobilis, was introduced into the strain. The tag enabled 61% of the beta-glucosidase activity to be transported through the cytoplasmic membrane of the recombinant strain which then produced 0.49 g ethanol/g cellobiose.
TI  - Wood adhesives prepared from lucerne fiber fermentation residues of Ruminococcus  albus and Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Fermentation residues (consisting of incompletely fermented fiber, adherent bacterial cells, and a glycocalyx material that enhanced bacterial adherence) were obtained by growing the anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria Ruminococcus albus 7 or Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 on a fibrous fraction derived from lucerne (Medicago sativa L.). The dried residue was able to serve as an effective co-adhesive for phenol-formaldehyde (PF) bonding of aspen veneer sheets to one another. Testing of the resulting plywood panels revealed that the adhesive, formulated to contain 30% of its total dry weight as fermentation residue, displayed shear strength and wood failure values under both wet and dry conditions that were comparable with those of industry standards for PF that contained much smaller amounts of fillers or extenders. By contrast, PF adhesives prepared with 30% of dry weight as either unfermented lucerne fiber or conventional fillers or extenders rather than as fermentation residues, displayed poor performance, particularly under wet conditions.
TI  - Effect of short-chain acids on the carboxymethylcellulase activity of the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The addition of 100-300 mmol/L of acetic, propionic, butyric or lactic acids (short-chain acids), or of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids (volatile fatty acids, VFA) mixtures increased the degradation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) by R. albus (7.5 to 46 and 6 to 39 %, respectively). Differences among individual acids were observed at 300 mmol/L whereas VFA mixtures differed at 100 mmol/L. When assayed at the same concentration, CMCase activity was increased less by NaCl than by the short-chain acids, whereas ethylene glycol decreased the activity. Since osmolarity and/or ionic strength changes in the medium cannot completely account for the observed increases of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) activity, it is suggested that the anions of short-chain acids produce changes in the reaction media polarity that contribute to the effects observed. Alterations in the media could also bring about conformational changes in CMCase leading to increased rates of reaction and subsequent increases in CMC degradation. Finally, explanations for the observed phenomena based on the direct effect of the compounds tested on the cellulosome complex, its domains, and/or its component enzymes are proposed.
TI  - Variation in antimicrobial action of proanthocyanidins from Dorycnium rectum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - The proanthocyanidin polymer fractions of the leaves of the forage legume Dorycnium rectum were analysed by acid catalysis with benzyl mercaptan, NMR and ES-MS. The results showed that D. rectum differs from other temperate proanthocyanidin-containing forage legumes in that the range of polymers extends up to very high degrees of polymerisation. Three fractions were characterised as low, medium, and high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fractions with mean degree of polymerisations of 10.3, 41 and 127, respectively. Epigallocatechin was the most abundant extension unit and the terminating flavan-3-ols comprised largely catechin and gallocatechin units in equal proportions. Formation of thiolyated dimer products showed the interflavan-linkages of the lower molecular weight proanthocyanidins to be predominantly C4-->C8 with a small amount of C4-->C6. ES-MS spectra distinguished lower from higher polymeric proanthocyanidins from M2- to M8(2)-. The antibacterial activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against pure cultures of microbes selected from the ruminal population to represent fibre degrading, proteolytic and hyper ammonia producing bacteria in broth culture was evaluated. The activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against Clostridium aminophilum, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Clostridium proteoclasticum was significantly dependent on their structure but not so against Ruminococcus albus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The latter observation was unique in that they were sensitive to all proanthocyanidin fractions evaluated, even at the lowest concentration (100 microg/ml). The results suggest the effects of the extractable proanthocyanidins on rumen microbes should be considered when evaluating an alternative proanthocyanidin-containing forage source for ruminants, such as D. rectum.
TI  - Cloning of the Ruminococcus albus cel5D and cel9A genes encoding dockerin module-containing endoglucanases and expression of cel5D in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An EcoRI chromosomal DNA fragment of Ruminococcus albus F-40 that conferred endoglucanase activity on Escherichia coli was cloned. An open reading frame (ORF1) and another incomplete reading frame (ORF2) were found in the EcoRI fragment. The ORF2 was completed using inverse PCR genome walking technique. ORF1 and ORF2, which confront each other, encoded cellulases belonging to families 5 and 9 of the glycoside hydrolases and were designated cel5D and cel9A respectively. The cel5D gene encodes 753 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 83,409. Cel5D consists of a signal peptide of 24 amino acids, a family-5 catalytic module, a dockerin module, and two family-4 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). The cel9A gene encodes 936 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 104,174, consisting of a signal peptide, a family-9 catalytic module, a family-3 CBM, and a dockerin module. The catalytic module polypeptide (rCel5DCat) derived from Cel5D was constructed, expressed, and purified from a recombinant E. coli. The truncated enzyme hydrolyzed cellohexaose, cellopentaose, and cellotetraose to yield mainly cellotriose and cellobiose with glucose as a minor product, but the enzyme was less active toward cellotriose and not active toward cellobiose, suggesting that this enzyme is a typical endoglucanase. rCel5DCat had a Km of 3.9 mg/ml and a Vmax of 37.2 micromol/min/mg for carboxymethycellulose.
TI  - Bacteriophages that infect the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus  AR67.
AB  - AIM: To isolate bacterial viruses that infect the ruminal cellulolytic bacterium  Ruminococcus albus. METHODS: Four phages infecting R. albus AR67 were isolated under anaerobic conditions using the soft-agar overlay technique. The phages were characterized on morphology, solvent stability, nucleic acid type and digestion characteristics. Two phages, phiRa02 and phiRa04 comprised icosahedral virions with linear double-stranded DNA and appeared to belong to the family Podoviridae [corrected] The other two phages are most likely filamentous phages with circular single-stranded DNA of the family Inoviridae. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Viruses of the family Inoviridae [corrected] have not previously been isolated from rumen bacteria. The phages isolated in this study are the first phages shown to infect the cellulolytic bacteria of the rumen. This suggests that the cellulolytic populations of the rumen are subject to lytic events that may impact on the ability of these bacteria to degrade plant fibre and on the nutrition of the animal.
TI  - A novel family of carbohydrate-binding modules identified with Ruminococcus albus proteins.
AB  - We recently showed that some of the enzymes underpinning cellulose solubilization by Ruminococcus albus 8 lack the conventional type of dockerin module characteristic of cellulosomal proteins and instead, bear an "X" domain of unknown function at their C-termini. We have now subcloned and expressed six X domains and showed that five of them bind to xylan, chitin, microcrystalline and phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose, as well as more heterogenous substrates such as alfalfa cell walls, banana stem and wheat straw. The X domain that did not bind to these substrates was derived from a family-5 glycoside hydrolase (Cel5G), which possesses two X domains in tandem. Whereas the internal X domain failed to bind to the substrates, the recombinant dyad exhibited markedly enhanced binding relative to that observed for the C-terminal X domain alone. The evidence supports a distinctive carbohydrate-binding role of broad specificity for this type of domain, and we propose a novel family (designated family 37) of carbohydrate-binding modules that appear to be peculiar to R. albus.
TI  - Albusin B, a bacteriocin from the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7 that inhibits growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - An approximately 32-kDa protein (albusin B) that inhibited growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was isolated from culture supernatants of Ruminococcus albus 7. Traditional cloning and gene-walking PCR techniques revealed an open reading frame (albB) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32,168 Da. A BLAST search revealed two homologs of AlbB from the unfinished genome of R. albus 8 and moderate similarity to LlpA, a recently described 30-kDa bacteriocin from Pseudomonas sp. strain BW11M1.
TI  - Cel6B of Thermobifidus fusca and a Cel5-CBM6 of Ruminococcus albus containing a cellulose binding site show synergistic effect on hydrolysis of native plant cellulose.
AB  - Hydrolysis of cellulose requires two different types of cellulases: exo- and endocellulase. Here, we investigated for the hydrolysis of cellulose by two types of cellulases, an endoglucanase (Cel5) from Ruminococcus albus fused with the xylanase A cellulose binding domain II (CBM6) of Clostridium stercorarium and Thermobifidus fusca E3, an exoglucanase (Cel6B). Cel5-CBM6 or Cel6B showed a linear relationship between the production of soluble sugars and the incubation time when native alfalfa cellulose was used as a substrate. Cel5-CBM6 produces more soluble sugars than Cel6B and the hydrolysis of cellulose by a mixture of the two enzymes produces substantially more (22%) soluble sugars than the total amount produced by these enzymes individually. Although Cel5-CBM6 solubilized high quantities of sugars from alfalfa cellulose, it did not significantly decrease its crystallinity, while Cel6B decreased the crystallinity of cellulose by 34%. When the two cellulases were combined, a decrease of more than 50% in the content of crystalline cellulose was observed. The enzyme-gold labeling experiments revealed that both enzymes showed a high affinity for all substrates. Furthermore, simultaneous visualization of the enzyme-binding sites revealed the preferred substrates in native lignocellulosic material. When plant cellulose was pre-incubated with Cel5-CBM6, density of the gold labeling greatly increased suggesting that preliminary exposure of lignocellulosic material to Cel5-CBM6 may have enhanced the accessibility of the substrate to Cel5-CBM6 and Cel6B. This result provides a plausible explanation for the observed endo/exo cellulase synergism during hydrolysis.
TI  - Ruminococcus albus 8 mutants defective in cellulose degradation are deficient in  two processive endocellulases, Cel48A and Cel9B, both of which possess a novel modular architecture.
AB  - The cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus 8 adheres tightly to cellulose, but the molecular biology underpinning this process is not well characterized. Subtractive enrichment procedures were used to isolate mutants of R. albus 8 that are defective in adhesion to cellulose. Adhesion of the mutant strains was reduced 50% compared to that observed with the wild-type strain, and cellulose solubilization was also shown to be slower in these mutant strains, suggesting that bacterial adhesion and cellulose solubilization are inextricably linked. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that all three mutants studied were impaired in the production of two high-molecular-mass, cell-bound polypeptides when they were cultured with either cellobiose or cellulose. The identities of these proteins were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry methods and genome sequence data for R. albus 8. One of the polypeptides is a family 9 glycoside hydrolase (Cel9B), and the other is a family 48 glycoside hydrolase (Cel48A). Both Cel9B and Cel48A possess a modular architecture, Cel9B possesses features characteristic of the B(2) (or theme D) group of family 9 glycoside hydrolases, and Cel48A is structurally similar to the processive endocellulases CelF and CelS from Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum, respectively. Both Cel9B and Cel48A could be recovered by cellulose affinity procedures, but neither Cel9B nor Cel48A contains a dockerin, suggesting that these polypeptides are retained on the bacterial cell surface, and recovery by cellulose affinity procedures did not involve a clostridium-like cellulosome complex. Instead, both proteins possess a single copy of a novel X module with an unknown function at the C terminus. Such X modules are also present in several other R. albus glycoside hydrolases and are phylogentically distinct from the fibronectin III-like and X modules identified so far in other cellulolytic bacteria.
TI  - Phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids do not affect xylan degradation by Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Since the addition of either ruminal fluid or a combination of phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids (PAA/PPA) has previously been shown to dramatically improve cellulose degradation and growth of Ruminococcus albus, it was of interest to determine the effects of these additives on xylan-grown cultures. Although cell-bound xylanase activity increased when either PAA/PPA or ruminal fluid was added to the growth medium, total xylanase did not change, and neither of these supplements affected the growth or xylan-degrading capacity of R. albus 8. Similarly, neither PAA/PPA nor ruminal fluid affected xylan degradation by multiple strains of R. albus when xylan prepared from oat spelts was used as a carbohydrate source. These results show that the xylanolytic potential of R. albus is not conditional on the availability of PAA/PPA or other components of ruminal fluid.
TI  - A comparative study between an endoglucanase IV and its fused protein complex Cel5-CBM6.
AB  - The recombinant endoglucanase IV (Cel5; encoded by egIV) of Ruminococcus albus was compared with protein Cel5-CBM6 comprised of Cel5 fused at the C-terminus with the single-cellulose binding domain II (CBM6) of Clostridium stercorarium xylanase A, in order to improve its binding ability. Previous analyses using ball-milled cellulose had suggested that a cellulose binding domain of xylanase A could enhance cellulase activity, especially with insoluble substrates. Comparison of the catalytic activities of Cel5 and Cel5-CBM6 were determined using carboxymethylcellulose, Avicel, and filter paper as substrates. This study confirmed previous findings, and provided further evidence suggesting that Cel5-CBM6 exhibits enhanced activity with insoluble cellulose compared to native Cel5. However, its hydrolytic activity with soluble substrates such as carboxymethylcellulose was comparable to Cel5. For both cellulases, central linkages of cellulooligosaccharides (up to six glucose residues) were found to be the preferred points of cleavage. The rates of hydrolysis with both cellulases increased with cellulooligosaccharide chain length, and at least three consecutive glycosyl residues seemed to be necessary for hydrolysis to occur. Cel5-CBM6 showed a higher affinity for cellulose substrates than did Cel5, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that CBM6 increases the affinity of Cel5 for insoluble substrates, and this increased binding capacity seems to result in increased catalytic activity.
TI  - Expression and export of a Ruminococcus albus cellulase in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens through the use of an alternative gene promoter and signal sequence.
AB  - Ruminococcal cellulase (Ruminococcus albus F-40 endoglucanase EgI) was successfully expressed in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OB156C, using the erm promoter from pAMbeta1. A newly identified signal peptide coding region of xynA from B. fibrisolvens 49 allowed efficient translocation of the foreign EgI into the extracellular fraction. First, B. fibrisolvens xynA with or without its own putative signal peptide (XynA SP) coding region was cloned into a shuttle vector to transform B. fibrisolvens OB156C. Both plasmids caused a 2- to 2.4-fold increase in xylanase activity. The transformant expressing XynA with the signal peptide showed a significantly higher proportion of activity in the extracellular fraction than the transformant with XynA lacking the signal peptide (75% vs. 19%), demonstrating the significance of XynA SP in the translocation of the expressed enzyme. Second, using the XynA SP coding region, secretion of EgI was attempted in B. fibrisolvens. Since the signal peptide of R. albus EgI did not function in B. fibrisolvens, it was replaced with the XynA SP. A high activity variant of EgI containing the XynA SP was transcribed using the erm promoter, resulting in a 27-fold increase in endoglucanase activity, most of which (>93%) was in the extracellular fraction of the B. fibrisolvens transformant. EgI without the XynA SP was scarcely detected in the extracellular fraction (<10%).
TI  - Solid residues from Ruminococcus cellulose fermentations as components of wood adhesive formulations.
AB  - Residues from the fermentation of cellulose by the anaerobic bacteria Ruminococcus albus (strain 7) or Ruminococcus flavefaciens (strains FD-1 or B34b) containing residual cellulose, bacterial cells and their associated adhesins, were examined for their ability to serve as components of adhesives for plywood fabrication. The residues contained differing amounts of protein (0.4-4.2% of dry weight), but the ratios of monosaccharides recovered following two-stage treatment of the residue with detergent (pH 7) and TFA were similar for all three strains (0.71 glucose:0.18 xylose:0.08 mannose:0.02 galactose), suggesting similarities in exopolysaccharide composition. Three-ply aspen panels prepared with fermentation residues (FR) displayed better shear strength and wood failure under dry conditions than following a vacuum/pressure/soak/dry treatment, but adhesive properties were inferior to those prepared with conventional phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesives. However, panels prepared by incorporating the R. albus 7 FR into PF formulation, at 73% by weight of the total adhesive, exhibited shear strength and wood failure similar to that obtained with PF adhesive alone. Use of residues from fermentations by these bacteria as components of adhesives may add value to biomass fermentations aimed primarily at producing ethanol and other chemical products.
TI  - Expression of Ruminococcus albus xylanase gene ( xynA) in Streptococcus bovis 12-U-1.
AB  - The objective of this study was to ligate the xylanase gene A ( xynA) isolated from Ruminococcus albus 7 into the promoter and signal-peptide region of the lichenase [beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase] gene of Streptococcus bovis JB1. This fusion gene was inserted into the pSBE11 vector, and the resulting recombinant, plasmid pXA, was used to transform S. bovis 12-U-1 cells. The transformant, S. bovis 12UXA, secreted the xylanase, which was stable against freeze-thaw treatment and long-time incubation at 37 degrees C. The introduction of pXA and production of xylanase did not affect cell growth, and the xylanase produced degraded xylan from oat-spelt and birchwood.
TI  - Kinetics of in sacco fiber-attachment of representative ruminal cellulolytic bacteria monitored by competitive PCR.
AB  - Stems of orchardgrass hay in nylon bags were incubated in the rumens of three ruminally fistulated sheep to monitor the rate and extent of fiber attachment by the representative ruminal cellulolytic bacteria via competitive polymerase chain reaction. After incubation for 5 min, the numbers of Fibrobacter succinogenes and the two ruminococcal species attached to stems were 10(5) and 10(4)/g dry matter (DM) of stem, respectively. At 10 min, the numbers of all three species attached to stems increased 10-fold. Thereafter, attached cell numbers of the three species gradually increased and peaked at 24 h (10(9)/g DM for F. succinogenes and 10(7)/g DM for Ruminococcus flavefaciens) or 48 h (10(6)/g DM for Ruminococcus albus). On the other hand, cell numbers of all three species in the whole digesta were constant over 24 h. Changes in the rate of in sacco neutral detergent fiber disappearance of hay stem, which showed a linear increase up to 96 h, were not synchronized with changes in cellulolytic bacterial mass. These results suggest that sufficient numbers of cells of the three cellulolytic species to move to new plant fragments are present at the start of incubation, the initial attachment to new plant matter is mostly accomplished within 10 min and then bacterial growth and fibrolytic action follow. F. succinogenes was most dominant, both in the whole rumen digesta and on the suspended hay stems, demonstrating the ecological and functional significance of this species in ruminal fiber digestion.
TI  - Supplementation of barley straw with Sesbania pachycarpa leaves in vitro: effects on fermentation variables and rumen microbial population structure quantified by ribosomal RNA-targeted probes.
AB  - Tropical livestock is often maintained on roughage-based diets deficient in N, and therefore requires supplementation with protein-rich substrates to achieve reasonable production levels. The optimum inclusion rate of a potential supplement is usually determined by in vivo feeding trials or by in vitro incubation of the diet components to estimate the feed value of the complete diet. The present work simulates a supplementation experiment in vitro, by incubating a pure roughage (barley straw), a pure supplement (Sesbania pachycarpa leaves) and mixtures of the two, with increasing inclusion levels of the supplement, in a short-term batch incubation system. Fermentation kinetics were followed by the release of fermentation endproducts (gas and short-chain fatty acids). Microbial biomass was estimated using ribosomal (r) RNA as internal marker for bacteria and eukaryotes separately. Cell-wall-degrading subpopulations were quantified by hybridisation with taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes targeting Chytridiomycetes, Fibrobacter spp., Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. Carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) was assayed as an indicator for cell-wall-degrading activity. The addition of S. pachycarpa leaves stimulated fermentation in all cases. Gas production, and especially rRNA concentration, showed clear maxima at 40 % S. pachycarpa inclusion, rates that significantly exceeded the values interpolated from the incubations of the pure substrates. Short-chain fatty acid yield changed only slightly, but in the same way. The analysis of the microbial population structure showed that the positive effects were mainly mediated through enhanced growth of Ruminococcus spp. Increasing proportions of S. pachycarpa leaves in the diet led to a drastic decline in the total eukaryotic population. This points to a defaunation, which may also have added to the positive effects. The eukaryotic subpopulation of the rumen fungi were affected to a lesser degree. Although the cell-wall-degrading organisms showed positive responses to the supplementation, the CMCase activity was not affected significantly by the supplementation. The present work shows that it is possible to predict optimum inclusion levels for a new feed supplement in vitro and thus reduce in vivo experiments. It was also demonstrated that true supplementation effects occur particularly for the microbial biomass production, which is the primary source of amino acids for the ruminant animal. The analysis of microbial population structure in context with conventional metabolic measurements adds valuable information to interpret the observed effects on production-related variables.
TI  - Activity and properties of fumarate reductase in ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Fumarate-reducing bacteria were sought from the main ruminal bacteria. Fibrobacter succinogenes, Selenomonas ruminantium subsp. ruminantium, Selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica, and Veillonella parvula reduced fumarate by using H(2) as an electron donor. Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella ruminicola, and Anaerovibrio lipolytica consumed fumarate, although they did not oxidize H(2). Of these bacteria, V. parvula, two strains of Selenomonas, and F. succinogenes had a high capacity to reduce fumarate. In all the fumarate-reducing bacteria examined, fumarate reductase existed in the membrane fraction. Based on the activity per cell mass and the affinity of fumarate reductase to fumarate, these bacteria were divided into two groups, which corresponded to the capacity to use H(2): A group of bacteria with higher activity and affinity were able to use H(2) as an electron donor for fumarate reduction. The bacteria in this group should gain an advantage over the bacteria in another group in fumarate reduction in the rumen. Cellulose digestion by R. albus was improved by fumarate reduction by S. lactilytica as a result of an increased growth of R. albus, which may have been caused by the fact that S. lactilytica immediately consumed H(2) produced by R. albus. Thus fumarate reduction may play an important role in keeping a low partial pressure of H(2) in the rumen.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of natural isolates of ruminococci and properties of plasmid pRA37 encoding erythromycin tolerance of Ruminococcus albus 37].
AB  
TI  - Adhesion to cellulose of the Gram-positive bacterium Ruminococcus albus involves  type IV pili.
AB  - This study was aimed at characterizing a cell-surface 25 kDa glycoprotein (GP25)  that was previously shown to be underproduced by a spontaneous adhesion-defective mutant D5 of Ruminococcus albus 20. An antiserum against wild-type strain 20 was adsorbed with the mutant D5 to enrich it in antibodies 'specific' to adhesion structures of R. albus 20. The resulting antiserum, called anti-Adh serum, blocked adhesion of R. albus 20 and reacted mainly with GP25 in bacterial and extracellular protein fractions of R. albus 20. The N-terminal sequence of purified GP25 was identical to that of CbpC, a 21 kDa cellulose-binding protein (CBP) of R. albus 8. The nucleotide sequence of the gp25 gene was determined by PCR and genomic walking procedures. The gp25 gene encoded a protein of 165 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 16940 Da that showed 72.9% identity with CbpC and presented homologies with type IV pilins of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Negative-staining electron microscopy revealed fine and flexible pili surrounding R. albus 20 cells while mutant cells were not piliated. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy showed that the anti-Adh serum probing mainly GP25, completely decorated the pili surrounding R. albus 20, thereby showing that GP25 was a major pilus subunit. This study shows for the first time the presence of pili at the surface of R. albus and identifies GP25 as their major protein subunit. Though GP25 was not identified as a CBP, isolated pili were shown to bind cellulose. In conclusion, these pili, which belong to the family of type IV pili, mediate adhesion of R. albus 20 to cellulose.
TI  - Cereal supplementation modified the fibrolytic activity but not the structure of  the cellulolytic bacterial community associated with rumen solid digesta.
AB  - 4 ruminally cannulated cows were fed a forage diet (93% hay + 7% straw) and a mixed diet (33 % hay + 7% straw + 40% barley) in a 2 x 2 crossover experimental design. In sacco degradation of forage, fibrolytic activities (polysaccharidases and glycosidases) of the solid-associated bacteria (SAB), and distribution of the 3 main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) were determined for both diets. Barley supplementation decreased the hay degradation rate and mainly the polysaccharidase activities of the SAB (30% on average). The sum of rRNA of the 3 cellulolytic bacterial species represented on average 17% of the total bacterial signal and R. albus was the dominant cellulolytic bacterial species of the 3 studied. Barley supplementation did not modify the proportion of the 3 cellulolytic bacteria attached to plant particles. The negative effect of barley on the ruminal hay degradation rate is due to a decrease in fibrolytic activity of the SAB, and not to a modification of the balance of the three cellulolytic bacterial species examined.
TI  - A comparison of enzymatic and molecular approaches to characterize the cellulolytic microbial ecosystems of the rumen and the cecum.
AB  - We used RNA probes and enzyme activities to compare the cellulolytic microbial ecosystems of the rumen and the cecum. Four rumen- and cecum-cannulated wethers were fed a diet of barley plus hay (60:40). Digesta samples were collected 1 h before feeding and 3, 6, and 9 h after feeding for measurements on microbial populations, and 1 h before feeding and 3 and 6 h after feeding for digestion measurements, pH, and VFA. Polysaccharidase and glycosidase specific activities of solid-adherent microorganisms were measured respectively by the amount of reducing sugars released from xylan or avicel or p-nitrophenol from the p-nitrophenol derivatives of xylose and glucose. The distribution and amounts of the three main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) were determined by dot-blot hybridization using specific 16SrRNA-targeting probes. Enzyme activities were higher in the rumen than in the cecum and before feeding than at 3 h after feeding. The sum of the three cellulolytic bacterial species represented, on average, 4.5% of the total bacterial RNA in the two compartments and did not vary with sampling time. The cellulolytic bacterial community structure was different in the two compartments, with F. succinogenes as the main species in the rumen and R. flavefaciens in the cecum. The lower cellulolytic activity in the cecum than in the rumen could not be ascribed to any difference in the structure of the cellulolytic bacterial community between these two compartments, and other hypotheses related to digestion are proposed.
TI  - Development and use of competitive PCR assays for the rumen cellulolytic bacteria: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - Competitive PCR assays were developed for the enumeration of the rumen cellulolytic bacterial species: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. The assays, targeting species-specific regions of 16S rDNA, were evaluated using DNA from pure culture and rumen digesta spiked with the relevant cellulolytic species. Minimum detection levels for F. succinogenes, R. albus and R. flavefaciens were 1-10 cells in pure culture and 10(3-4) cells per ml in mixed culture. The assays were reproducible and 11-13% inter- and intra-assay variations were observed. Enumeration of the cellulolytic species in the rumen and alimentary tract of sheep found F. succinogenes dominant (10(7) per ml of rumen digesta) compared to the Ruminococcus spp. (10(4-6) per ml). The population size of the three species did not change after the proportion of dietary alfalfa hay was increased. All three species were detected in the rumen, omasum, caecum, colon and rectum. Numbers of the cellulolytic species at these sites varied within and between animals.
TI  - Subcellular distribution of glycanases and related components in Ruminococcus albus SY3 and their role in cell adhesion to cellulose.
AB  - AIMS: To compare the subcellular distribution of glycanase-related components between wild-type Ruminococcus albus SY3 and an adhesion-defective mutant, to identify their possible contribution to the adhesion process, and to determine their association with cellulosome-like complexes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell fractionation revealed that most of the cellulases and xylanases were associated with capsular and cell-wall fractions. SDS-PAGE and gel filtration indicated that most of the bacterial enzyme activity was not integrated into cellulosome-like complexes. The adhesion-defective mutant produced significantly less (5- to 10-fold) overall glycanase activity, and the 'true cellulase activity' appeared to be entirely confined to the cell membrane fractions. Antibodies specific for the cellulosomal scaffoldin of Clostridium thermocellum recognized a single 240 kDa band in R. albus SY3. CONCLUSIONS: The adhesion-defective mutant appeared to be blocked in exocellular transport of enzymes involved in true cellulase activity. A potential cellulosomal scaffoldin candidate was identified in R. albus SY3. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several glycanase-related proteins and more than one mechanism appear to be involved in the adhesion of R. albus SY3 to cellulose.
TI  - Characterization of a spontaneous adhesion-defective mutant of Ruminococcus albus strain 20.
AB  - A spontaneous adhesion-defective mutant (mutant D5) of Ruminococcus albus strain  20 was isolated and compared to the parent to investigate the impact of the mutation on cellulolysis and to identify the adhesion mechanism of R. albus. The comparison of kinetics of cellulose degradation by strain 20 and mutant D5 showed that the mutation delayed and reduced bacterial growth on cellulose and cellulose degradation. These results were partly explained by a twofold lower cellulase activity in the mutant than in the parent. The glycocalyx of strain 20, observed by transmission electron microscopy, was large and homogeneous, and linked cells to cellulose. The mutant glycocalyx was aggregated at its periphery and cells attached loosely to cellulose. A glycoprotein of 25 kDa (GP25), present in the membrane fraction and the extracellular medium of strain 20, was not detected in the same fractions of mutant D5. Though glycoprotein GP25 did not bind to cellulose, it may be involved in adhesion as an intermediate component. Different cell-surface features of mutant D5 (cellulases, glycoprotein GP25, glycocalyx) were thus affected, any or all of which may be involved in its adhesion-defective phenotype. These results suggest that adhesion and cellulolysis are linked and that adhesion is a multifactorial phenomenon that involves at least the extracellular glycocalyx.
TI  - Fibrolytic activities and cellulolytic bacterial community structure in the solid and liquid phases of rumen contents.
AB  - Four sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet. Rumen content samples were collected three hours after feeding in order to total microorganism population (TP), solid attached population (SAP) and solid attached firmly population (SAFP). Fibrolytic specific activities (xylanase, CMCase and beta-glycosidases) were estimated by the amount of reducing sugars or p-nitrophenol released from the appropriate substrate. The distribution of the three main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) was quantified by dot-blot hybridisation using specific 16S-rRNA-targeting probes. Specific activities of polysaccharidase enzymes were higher in SAP than in TP, and in SAFP than in SAP. The sum of RNA of the three cellulolytic bacterial species represented on average 9% of the total bacterial RNA, and increased after filtration. In all samples, the relative population size of F. succinogenes was higher than that of R. albus and of R. flavefaciens. These results demonstrate that the most active enzymes are secreted by the particle-associated microorganisms. The differences in composition of the microflora between the solid and liquid phase suggest that bacteria are not equally distributed throughout the rumen content: the cellulolytic species are present in a higher proportion in the solid phase of rumen contents.
TI  - Invited review: adhesion mechanisms of rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - We divided the adhesion process of the predominant cellulolytic rumen bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus into four phases: 1) transport of the nonmotile bacteria to the substrate; 2) initial nonspecific adhesion of bacteria to unprotected sites of the substrate that is dominated by constitutive elements of bacterial glycocalyx; 3) specific adhesion via adhesins or ligands formation with the substrate, which can be dominated by several bacterial organelles including cellulosome complexes, fimbriae connections, glycosylated epitopes of cellulose-binding protein (CBP) or glycocalyx, and cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of enzymes; 4) proliferation of the attached bacteria on potentially digestible tissues of the substrate. Each of the phases and its significance in the adhesion process are described. Factors affecting bacterial adhesion are described including: 1) factors related to bacterial age, glycocalyx condition, and microbial competition; 2) factors related to the nature of substrate including, cuticle protection, surface area, hydration, and ionic charge; and 3) environmental factors including pH, temperature, and presence of cations and soluble carbohydrate. Based on the information available from the literature, it appears that each of the predominant rumen bacteria--F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, and R. albus--has a specific mechanism of adhesion to cellulose. In F. succinogenes, both the glycosidic residues of the outer membrane CBP and especially of the 180-kDa CBP, and the distinct CBD of EG2 EGF and Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, may play a role in the adhesion to cellulose. No direct evidence, except scanning electron microscopy observations, yet supports the existence of either cellulosome complex or fimbriae structures involved in the adhesion mechanism of F. succinogenes. At least two mechanisms, cellulosome-like complexes and carbohydrate epitopes of the glycocalyx layer are involved in the specific adhesion of R. flavefaciens to cellulose. Ruminococcus albus possesses at least two mechanisms for specific adhesion to cellulose: a cellulosomal-like mechanism, and a CbpC (Pil)-protein mechanism that probably involves the production of fimbrial-like structures. Indirect and direct studies suggested that carbohydrate epitopes of CBPs and CBD epitope of cellulases may also be involved mostly in the nonspecific phase of adhesion of R. albus.
TI  - Incorporation of [(15)N] ammonia by the cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes BL2, Ruminococcus albus SY3, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.
AB  - The origin of cell nitrogen and amino acid nitrogen during growth of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in different growth media was investigated by using (15)NH(3). At high concentrations of peptides (Trypticase, 10 g/liter) and amino acids (15.5 g/liter), significant amounts of cell nitrogen of Fibrobacter succinogenes BL2 (51%), Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 (43%), and Ruminococcus albus SY3 (46%) were derived from non-NH(3)-N. With peptides at 1 g/liter, a mean of 80% of cell nitrogen was from NH(3). More cell nitrogen was formed from NH(3) during growth on cellobiose compared with growth on cellulose in all media. Phenylalanine was essential for F. succinogenes, and its (15)N enrichment declined more than that of other amino acids in all species when amino acids were added to the medium.
TI  - Competition among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in the absence  or presence of non-cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Competition among three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria - Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and Ruminococcus albus 7 - was studied in the presence or absence of the non-cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Selenomonas ruminantium or Streptococcus bovis. Co-cultures were grown under either batch or continuous conditions and populations were estimated using species-specific oligonucleotide probes to 16S rRNA. The three cellulolytic species co-existed in cellobiose batch co-culture, but inclusion of either Sel. ruminantium or Str. bovis yielded nearly a monoculture of the non-cellulolytic competitor. In cellobiose chemostats, R. albus completely dominated the triculture, but R. flavefaciens became predominant over F. succinogenes and R. albus when Sel. ruminantium was co-inoculated into the chemostats. Similar effects on competition were observed in the presence of Str. bovis at a lower (0.021 h(-1)), but not at a higher (0.045 h(-1)) dilution rate. In cellulose batch co-cultures, R. albus was more abundant than both F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens, regardless of the presence of the non-cellulolytic species. Co-existence among the three cellulolytic species was observed in almost all cellulose chemostats, but Sel. ruminantium altered the relative proportions of the cellulolytic species. R. albus and R. flavefaciens were found to produce inhibitors that suppressed growth of R. flavefaciens and F. succinogenes, respectively. These data indicate that interactions among cellulolytic bacteria, while complex, can be modified further by non-cellulolytic species.
TI  - Regulation of H(+)-ATPase synthesis in response to reduced pH in ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The capacity of ruminal bacteria to regulate H(+)-ATPase synthesis in response to reduced pH was investigated to explain acid tolerance. The activity of H(+)-ATPase in Streptococcus bovis, an acid-tolerant bacterium, was 2.2-fold higher at pH 4.5 than at pH 5.5. The increase in the amount of H(+)-ATPase protein was similar, suggesting that the increase in H(+)-ATPase activity is owing to the increase in H(+)-ATPase synthesis. The level of atp-mRNA at pH 4.5 was 2.5-fold higher than at pH 5.5, indicating that H(+)-ATPase synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level, responding to low pH. In Ruminococcus albus, an acid-sensitive bacterium, H(+)-ATPase activity, the amount of H(+)-ATPase protein, and the level of atp-mRNA at pH 7.0 were similar to the values at pH 6.0, the lowest pH permitting growth. This result suggests that R. albus is incapable of enhancing H(+)-ATPase synthesis at low pH. Thus, acid tolerance appeared to be related to the capacity to augment the synthesis of H(+)-ATPase responding to low pH.
TI  - Anaerobic bioconversion of cellulose by Ruminococcus albus, Methanobrevibacter smithii, and Methanosarcina barkeri.
AB  - A system is described that combines the fermentation of cellulose to acetate, CH4, and CO2 by Ruminococcus albus and Methanobrevibacter smithii with the fermentation of acetate to CH4 and CO2 by Methanosarcina barkeri to convert cellulose to CH4 and CO2. A cellulose-containing medium was pumped into a co-culture of the cellulolytic R. albus and the H2-using methanogen, Mb. smithii. The effluent was fed into a holding reservoir, adjusted to pH 4.5, and then pumped into a culture of Ms. barkeri maintained at constant volume by pumping out culture contents. Fermentation of 1% cellulose to CH4 and CO2 was accomplished during 132 days of operation with retention times (RTs) of the Ms. barkeri culture of 7.5-3.8 days. Rates of acetate utilization were 9.5-17.3 mmol l(-1) day(-1) and increased with decreasing RT. The Ks for acetate utilization was 6-8 mM. The two-stage system can be used as a model system for studying biological and physical parameters that influence the bioconversion process. Our results suggest that manipulating the different phases of cellulose fermentation separately can effectively balance the pH and ionic requirements of the acid-producing phase with the acid-using phase of the overall fermentation.
TI  - The effect of a methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, on the growth rate, organic acid production, and specific ATP activity of three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Three predominant ruminal cellulolytic organisms, Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 8, and R. flavefaciens FD-1, were cultured with a methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii. Growth rates, bacterial protein, organic acids, and methane production were measured. When grown in diculture with the methanogen, a fermentative advantage was observed with F. succinogenes S85 as seen by an increase in specific rate of ATP production and organic acid concentration. The introduction of the methanogen did not improve the growth rate, organic acid yield, or specific rate of ATP production for R. albus 8. The growth rate and amount of organic acid end products increased when R. flavefaciens FD-1 was cultured with the methanogen; however, the specific activity of ATP production did not increase.
TI  - Effects of the Fusarium spp. mycotoxins fusaric acid and deoxynivalenol on the growth of Ruminococcus albus and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium.
AB  - The Fusarium spp. mycotoxins fusaric acid and deoxynivalenol (DON) were tested for antimicrobial activity against Ruminococcus albus and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium. The growth of both organisms was inhibited by fusaric acid as low as 15 micrograms/mL (84 microM) but not by DON, at levels as high as 100 micrograms/mL (338 microM). No synergistic inhibitory effect was observed with DON plus fusaric acid. Neither organism was able to adapt to the fusaric acid and responses of each organism to the compound were different. The optical density (OD) maximum for R. albus, but not for M. ruminantium, was diminished after 28 days incubation at concentrations of fusaric acid below 240 micrograms/mL. Inhibition of R. albus started before significant growth had occurred, while M. ruminantium doubled twice before the onset of inhibition. Responses to picolinic acid, an analog of fusaric acid, were also dramatically different between the two microorganisms with M. ruminantium exhibiting a severe lag followed by a complete recovery of growth, while R. albus was only slightly inhibited with no lag. These results suggest that the mechanism of fusaric acid inhibition is specific to each microorganism. This is the first demonstration of the common mycotoxin fusaric acid inhibiting the growth of rumen bacteria.
TI  - Effect of steroidal saponin from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  - The effects of steroidal saponins (SAP) isolated from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. Prevotella bryantii, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg SAP ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). The four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to SAP, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves were determined. The cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on Whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram SAP ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. The ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to SAP. Steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of Strep. bovis (P < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), P. bryantii (P < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and Rb. amylophilus (P < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of S. ruminantium was enhanced (P < 0.05) at 10, 14 and 24 h. The growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (P > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total SAP and soluble (deglycosylated) SAP in the liquid fraction were unchanged (P > 0.05) over time. Steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but F. succinogenes was less (P < 0.05) sensitive to SAP and more (P < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating SAP than were Rc. flavefaciens or Rc. albus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that SAP altered the cell walls of the SAP-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. The ruminal fungi, Neocallimastix frontalis and Piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram SAP ml-1. Filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram SAP ml-1. Steroidal saponins from Y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. As such, SAP may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.
TI  - Use of 16S-rRNA Based Techniques to Investigate the Ecological Succession of Microbial Populations in the Immature Lamb Rumen: Tracking of a Specific Strain of Inoculated Ruminococcus and Interactions with Other Microbial Populations in Vivo.
AB  - The establishment of microorganisms in the rumen is a critical step if rumen manipulation is to be accomplished by use of microbial inoculants. Microbial populations in the maturing rumen undergo successional changes and, while in a state of flux, provide a possible opportunity for the introduction of specific strains of bacteria. While the rumen of the young lamb was maturing, we measured changes in several microbial populations with 16S-rRNA specific oligonucleotides: Rumincoccus, Fibrobacter, eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, the Bacteroides-Porphromonas-Prevotella group, and anaerobic rumen fungi. In this study we repeatedly dosed 15 lambs with approximately 3.4 x 10(8) to 0.8 x 10(9) Ruminococcus cells dose(-1), twice a week, for 7 wk from 23 d to 63 d of age. Of the five Ruminococcus strains dosed (R. albus SY3 and AR67, and R. flavefaciens Y1, LP9155, and AR72) the most specific primers (based on 16S rDNA) were obtained for strain SY3. There was an increase in the eukaryotic population during dosing, and it was hypothesized that protozoal predation contributed to the disappearance of strain SY3. At the end of dosing PCR amplification showed that SY3 were approximately 10(9) cells ml(-1), but decreased to below the detection limit of the PCR system (8.6 x 10(4) ml(-1)) within 28 d postdosing. These experiments showed that fibrolytic populations increased significantly (P < 0.1) above the controls during the dosing period and were elevated for several days postdosing. This suggests that dosing of highly fibrolytic bacteria makes more of the fiber available to other organisms able to degrade fiber, and in so doing increases the overall fibrolytic activity of the rumen. Examination of the succession of gram-positive bacteria and the Bacteroides-Porphromonas-Prevotella group showed a decline in relative abundance as the lambs matured.
TI  - Adhesion to cellulose by Ruminococcus albus: a combination of cellulosomes and Pil-proteins?
AB  - An obligatory step in cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria is the adhesion of the bacterium to the polysaccharide. In many anaerobic bacteria the adhesion protein, and the enzymes required for extensive polysaccharide hydrolysis, are organized into a complex and interesting structure called the cellulosome. The Gram-positive anaerobe Ruminococcus albus also produces a cellulosome-like complex, but the bacterium appears to possess other mechanism(s) for adhesion to plant surfaces and genes encoding functions relevant to growth on cellulose are conditionally expressed, as suggested by a combination of functional proteomics, differential display reverse-transcriptase PCR, and mutational analysis. A novel form of cellulose-binding protein has been identified and shown to belong to the Pil-protein family, being most similar to the type 4 fimbrial proteins of Gram-negative, pathogenic bacteria. These studies have provided new insights into the adhesion of bacteria to plant surfaces, and call attention to the likely existence of genetically analogous adhesion determinants in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the cellulolytic complex (cellulosome) from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The cellulolytic complex was isolated from the culture supernatant of Ruminococcus albus strain F-40 grown on cellulose by a Sephacryl S-300HR column chromatography. The molecular mass of the cellulolytic complex was found to be larger than 1.5 x 10(6) Da. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis indicated that the cellulolytic complex contained at least 15 proteins with molecular weights from 40kDa to 250 kDa. Among them, 11 proteins showed endoglucanase and/or xylanase activities on the zymograms. Immunological analysis using an antiserum raised against the dockerin domain of endoglucanase VII of R. albus (DocVII) suggested that at least 7 proteins in the cellulolytic complex contained a dockerin domain immunoreactive with the anti-Doc-VII antiserum. Furthermore, DocVII was shown to specifically interact with a 40-kDa protein of the cellulolytic complex by Far-Western blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that the cellulolytic complex produced by R. albus resembles the cellulosome specified for the cellulolytic complex of several clostridia such as Clostridium thermocellum and respective components are assembled into the cellulosome by the mechanism common in all of the cellulolytic clostridia, i.e., the cellulosome is formed by the interaction between a dockerin domain of catalytic components and a cohesin domain of a scaffolding protein.
TI  - Sequence of egV and properties of EgV, a Ruminococcus albus endoglucanase containing a dockerin domain.
AB  - The Ruminococcus albus F-40 egV gene, encoding endoglucanase V (EGV), consists of an open reading frame of 1,833 nucleotides and encodes 611 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 67,103. The deduced EGV is a modular enzyme composed of a catalytic domain of family 5 of glycosyl hydrolases, a domain of unknown function, and a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly, suggesting that R. albus F-40 produces a cellulosome, and EGV is a component of the cellulosome. A truncated form of EGV with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000 was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli and characterized since EGV suffered from partial proteolysis by E. coli protease(s). The truncated EGV was active toward carboxylmethyl cellulose, xylan, lichenan, and acid-swollen cellulose. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. By Western blot analysis using the antiserum raised against the truncated enzyme, EGV was detected in the whole cells but not in the culture supernatant of R. alubus F-40, suggesting that EGV was located on the cell surface.
TI  - Feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. Recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. The problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. When the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. Recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast RNA was 100.6+/-3.2%. Purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, D16f, H10b, and H17c; Fibrobacter succinogenes B21a; Lachnospira multiparus D25e; Lactobacillus lactis ARD26e; Prevotella ruminicola H15a; Ruminococcus albus 7; Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b; and Streptococcus bovis ARD5d. The CV for the most-probable-number (MPN) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. Considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. More consistent values were obtained when these components were expressed on a dry matter basis. Purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. For samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. The value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. Based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. Limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which results in lower purine:protein ratios.
TI  - 16S rDNA sequencing of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens: design of a signature probe and its application in adult sheep.
AB  - The ruminococci are an important group of fibrolytic bacteria inhabiting the rumen. Seventeen strains of presumptively identified Ruminococcus were evaluated by a combination of nearly complete and partial 16S rDNA sequence that identified all strains as either Ruminococcus albus or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. All sequences fell into cluster IV of the clostridia, while other species of ruminococci (e.g. Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus lactaris) fall into cluster XIVa of the clostridia. Ruminococcus cluster IV sequences were used to design a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe to assess the relative abundance of target populations in a stable ruminal environment. A stable population (animals fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to diurnal rumen fluctuations. The steady state populations were sampled six times over a 24 d period and direct microscopic counts (DC), total culturable counts (TCC), and total cellulolytic counts (CEL) were determined. DC and culturable data (TCC and CEL) were compared with relative abundance estimates of Ruminococcus IV and Fibrobacter succinogenes. A combination of the Ruminococcus and F. succinogenes probes accounted for 4.0% of the bacterial population and cellulolytic bacteria (measured by most-probable numbers) were 5.2% of the total culturable count. These data suggest that a major portion of the Ruminococcus and Fibrobacter diversity has been cultured and is represented by available sequences. Steady state populations were measured over several days in three sheep and an estimate of variation in DC, TCC, CEL and 16S-based data were obtained. These variance estimates could be used to determine the theoretical sample sizes required to obtain statistically significant differences under different experimental conditions.
TI  - Identification of Ruminococcus flavefaciens as the predominant cellulolytic bacterial species of the equine cecum.
AB  - Detection and quantification of cellulolytic bacteria with oligonucleotide probes showed that Ruminococcus flavefaciens was the predominant species in the pony and donkey cecum. Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus were present at low levels. Four isolates, morphologically resembling R. flavefaciens, differed from ruminal strains by their carbohydrate utilization and their end products of cellobiose fermentation.
TI  - Effect of diet on populations of three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The effects of four contrasting diets were determined on populations of three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes) using oligonucleotide probes to rRNA. Diets based on alfalfa silage or corn silage as the primary fiber source were formulated to contain either 24 or 32% neutral detergent fiber measured after alpha-amylase treatment. The diets were fed twice daily to four ruminally fistulated, lactating Holstein cows in a trial using a Latin square design. The cows fed the alfalfa silage diets had higher dry matter intakes and milk production and smaller pH fluctuations than did cows fed the corn silage diets (0.3 vs. 0.8 units). The total populations of the three cellulolytic species at 3 h after feeding ranged from 0.3 to 3.9% of the bacterial domain; R. albus was generally the most abundant of the three species. The data are in general agreement with population assessments obtained by some traditional methods of culture enumeration. Although diet and individual cows had major effects on ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid concentrations and on milk production and composition, differences in cellulolytic populations that were attributable to individual cows were larger than those attributable to diet, suggesting that each cow maintained a unique assemblage of cellulolytic species.
TI  - Adherence of the gram-positive bacterium Ruminococcus albus to cellulose and identification of a novel form of cellulose-binding protein which belongs to the Pil family of proteins.
AB  - The adherence of Ruminococcus albus 8 to crystalline cellulose was studied, and an affinity-based assay was also used to identify candidate cellulose-binding protein(s). Bacterial adherence in cellulose-binding assays was significantly increased by the inclusion of either ruminal fluid or micromolar concentrations of both phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids in the growth medium, and the addition of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to assays decreased the adherence of the bacterium to cellulose. A cellulose-binding protein with an estimated molecular mass following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of approximately 21 kDa, designated CbpC, was present in both cellobiose- and cellulose-grown cultures, and the relative abundance of this protein increased in response to growth on cellulose. Addition of 0.1% (wt/vol) CMC to the binding assays had an inhibitory effect on CbpC binding to cellulose, consistent with the notion that CbpC plays a role in bacterial attachment to cellulose. The nucleotide sequence of the cbpC gene was determined by a combination of reverse genetics and genomic walking procedures. The cbpC gene encodes a protein of 169 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 17,655 Da. The amino-terminal third of the CbpC protein possesses the motif characteristic of the Pil family of proteins, which are most commonly involved with the formation of type 4 fimbriae and other surface-associated protein complexes in gram-negative, pathogenic bacteria. The remainder of the predicted CbpC sequence was found to have significant identity with 72- and 75-amino-acid motifs tandemly repeated in the 190-kDa surface antigen protein of Rickettsia spp., as well as one of the major capsid glycoproteins of the Chlorella virus PBCV-1. Northern blot analysis showed that phenylpropionic acid and ruminal fluid increase cbpC mRNA abundance in cellobiose-grown cells. These results suggest that CbpC is a novel cellulose-binding protein that may be involved in adherence of R. albus to substrate and extends understanding of the distribution of the Pil family of proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Cellulosolytic bacteria of the genus Ruminococcus from cattle rumen].
AB  - Fifty-eight strains of cellulolytic cocci were isolated from the rumen of cows bred at different farms. These cultures were referred to Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Investigation of the rate of cellulose hydrolysis showed that the ruminococci were heterogeneous with respect to this parameter and could be classified into high-, medium-, and low-activity strains, hydrolyzing substrate in 50, 60-80, and 100 h, respectively. This rate was shown to be directly related (r = 0.69) to the capacity of ruminococci to adhere to the substrate.
TI  - Effect of Aspergillus oryzae extract alone or in combination with antimicrobial compounds on ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The effect of an Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on the growth rates of pure cultures of ruminal bacteria was determined. Bacteria were grown in an anaerobic ruminal fluid and carbohydrate medium. A sterile filtrate made with 10% A. oryzae was added to the medium at 2 or 5% (vol/vol) to provide a final A. oryzae concentration of 2 or 5 mg/ml, respectively. The filtrate had no effect on the growth rates of 10 of the 19 ruminal bacteria tested; however, the filtrate increased the growth rates of the bacteria that digest fiber, Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes, and the bacteria that utilize lactate, Megasphaera elsdenii, Selenomonas lactilytica, and Selenomonas ruminantium. No differences in growth rate were detected between the two concentrations of A. oryzae filtrate. We also investigated the interactions between A. oryzae and antimicrobial compounds on the growth rates of six species of ruminal bacteria that had shown positive responses or no response to the filtrate. The addition of A. oryzae filtrate to medium containing chlortetracycline or neomycin tended to diminish the negative effects of those compounds on the growth rates of some ruminal bacteria, although the bacteria had no positive growth response to the filtrate alone. In contrast, the combination of A. oryzae filtrate and tylosin decreased the growth rate of Sel. ruminantium D. These results indicated that A. oryzae stimulates growth of some bacteria that digest fiber and ferment lactate in the rumen and interacts positively or negatively with certain antimicrobial feed additives.
TI  - Partial purification and characterization of RalF40I, a class II restriction endonuclease from Ruminococcus albus F-40, which recognizes and cleaves 5'-/GATC-3'.
AB  - Restriction endonuclease RalF40I was purified from cell-free extracts of the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus F-40 heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The preparation was active only on DNA substrates that were not Dammethylated. RalF401 recognizes the 4-bp palindrome, 5'-/GATC-3', and cleaves DNA at the 5' side of G in the sequence, producing 5' tetranucleotide protruding ends. RalF40I is a class II restriction endonuclease and an isoschizomer of MboI and DpnII.
TI  - A cysteine desulphurase gene from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - A gene whose predicted product shows 40-50% sequence identity with the products of nifS genes from nitrogen-fixing bacteria was found downstream from a cellulase gene in a DNA fragment from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe, Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17. The R. flavefaciens gene product released sulphur from l-cysteine when expressed in Escherichia coli, indicating that the R. flavefaciens NifS enzyme may play a role in sulphuration, perhaps, as in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, supplying sulphur to FeS proteins. Sequences hybridising with the R. flavefaciens 17 nifS-like gene were also detected in R. flavefaciens 007 and in R. albus SY3.

TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.
TI  - Structural analysis of a new cryptic plasmid pAR67 isolated from Ruminococcus albus AR67.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of a new cryptic plasmid pAR67 isolated from a rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus AR67 has been determined. The plasmid pAR67 was 3419 bp in size with a 45% GC content. Two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding potential polypeptides of 285 and 165 amino acids, with limited sequence similarity to replication and mobilization proteins, respectively, were identified within the sequence. The region upstream of ORF1 had an AT-rich (80%) segment followed by four 19-bp direct repeats, which is similar to the structural organization characteristic of replication origins of some bacterial plasmids.
TI  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: is it an autoimmune disease due to bacteria showing molecular mimicry with brain antigens?
AB  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) could be an autoimmune disease produced following exposure of cattle to feedstuffs containing bacteria showing molecular mimicry between bacterial components and bovine tissue. Analysis of molecular sequence databases (Genbank and SwissProt) shows that three bacteria (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus,Ruminococcus albus, and Agrobacter tumefaciens) share sequences with the encephalitogenic peptide of bovine myelin, while three molecules in Escherichia coli show molecular mimicry with host-encoded prion protein. Immune responses against these bacteria at both T and B cell levels may cause neurological tissue injury resembling BSE. The role of these bacteria in BSE, if any, merits further investigation.
TI  - Microbial perspective on fiber utilization by swine.
AB  - Dietary fiber may contribute up to 30% of the maintenance energy needs of growing pigs. Higher energy contributions may be obtained from dietary fiber fed to sows, along with some improvements in reproduction, health, and well-being. As long as cereal grain supplies and high-quality protein supplements are abundant, the use of fibrous feeds for swine most likely will be limited. However, as the human demand for cereal grains increases, swine producers, especially those with reproductive animals, may be economically forced to incorporate alternative feedstuffs. These feedstuffs might include lignified plant cell wall material such as grasses and legumes, and feed-milling and distillery by-products that contain a high level of fiber residues. The microflora in swine large intestine will be able to adapt to these lignified forages and by-product feeds much better than the microflora in humans. Swine microflora contain highly active ruminal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacterial species, which include Fibrobacter succinogenes (intestinalis), Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio spp., and Prevotella ruminicola. Additionally, a new highly active cellulolytic bacterium, Clostridium herbivorans, has been recently isolated from pig large intestine. The populations of these microorganisms are known to increase in response to the ingestion of diets high in plant cell wall material. The numbers of cellulolytic bacteria from adult animals are approximately 6.7 times greater than those found in growing pigs. None of these highly active cellulolytic bacterial species are found in the human large intestine. Thus, the pig large intestinal fermentation of fiber seems to more closely resemble that of ruminants than that of humans.
TI  - Effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae culture on ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) culture on lactate utilization and cellulose digestion by ruminal bacteria. Growth of Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 in medium that contained 5 g/L of DL-lactate, Trypticase, and yeast extract was stimulated 7 and 15% by 1 and 5% (vol/vol) yeast culture filtrate respectively. The 1 and 5% yeast culture filtrate stimulated growth of Selenomonas ruminantium H18 and Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and T81 on 5 g/L of DL-lactate in medium without Trypticase or yeast extract. Growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and Ruminococcus albus B199 on 6 g/L of cellobiose was stimulated by the addition of yeast culture filtrate to medium without Trypticase or yeast extract. The yeast culture filtrate increased the concentrations of acetate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by Sel. ruminantium HD4 and increased the concentrations of propionate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by Sel. ruminantium H18 but did not alter end-product formation of M. elsdenii or cellulolytic bacteria. Treatment with yeast culture increased the initial rate but not the extent of cellulose digestion by F. succinogenes S85 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1. Collectively, these results suggest that yeast culture provides soluble growth factors (i.e., organic acids, B vitamins, and amino acids) that stimulate growth of ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
TI  - Cellobiose and cellodextrin metabolism by the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus is an important fibrolytic bacterium in the rumen. Cellobiose  is metabolized by this organism via hydrolytic and well as phosphorylytic enzymes, but the relative contributions of each pathway were not clear. The cellobiose consumption rate by exponentially growing cells was less than that of crude extracts (75 versus 243 nmol/min/mg protein). Cellobiose phosphorolytic cleavage was much greater than hydrolytic activity (179 versus 19 nmol/min/mg protein) indicating that phosphorylases were key enzymes in the initial metabolism of the soluble products of cellulose degradation. Cellodextrin phosphorylase appeared to be active against substrates as large as cellohexaose. Phosphorylase activities were cytoplasmic, but hydrolytic activities were associated with both the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Free glucose was phosphorylated with a GTP-dependent glucokinase, and this enzyme showed 20-fold higher activity with GTP or ITP (>324 nmol/min/mg protein) than with ATP, UTP, CTP, GDP, or PEP. The activity was decreased at least 57% when mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, or fructose was used as substrate compared with glucose. The Kms for glucose and GTP were 321 and 247 microM, respectively. Since phosphorolytic cleavage conserves more metabolic energy than simple hydrolysis, it is likely that such pathways provide for more efficient growth of R. albus in substrate-limiting conditions like those found in the rumen.
TI  - PCR detection of Ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faecal samples.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures for Ruminococcus spp. were developed and used for the detection of Ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faeces. The PCR specificity was established for Ruminococcus albus, R. bromii, R. obeum, R. callidus and R. flavefaciens. The PCR sensitivity ranged from 4 to 100 cells of the pure cultures, depending on the species. Ruminococcus albus, R. bromii, R. obeum and R. callidus were detected in human faeces. R. bromii, R. albus and R. obeum were also detected in animal faeces. R. flavefaciens was not detected in most of the samples tested, except for a weak positive in monkey faecal specimens. The PCR appears to be a specific and efficient method for the detection of Ruminococcus spp. in faecal specimens.
TI  - Competition between ruminal cellulolytic bacteria for adhesion to cellulose.
AB  - Competition for adhesion to cellulose among the three main ruminal cellulolytic bacterial species was studied using differential radiolabeling (14C/3H) of cells. When added simultaneously to cellulose, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1 and Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 showed some competition; however, both species were surpassed competitively by Ruminococcus albus 20. When R. flavefaciens FD1 and F. succinogenes S85 were already adherent, R. albus 20 adhesion occurred without inhibition but involved R. flavefaciens FD1 detachment.
TI  - Activity of H(+)-ATPase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  - Batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much H(+)-ATPase as Megasphaera elsdenii and Streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. Even in the cells grown in continuous culture at pH 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much H(+)-ATPase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. The amounts of H(+)-ATPase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest pH permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. These results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of H(+)-ATPase at neutral pH but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of H(+)-ATPase in response to low pH than the acid-tolerant bacteria. In addition, the H(+)-ATPases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low pH than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal pHs were similar.
TI  - Method for preparation of RNA from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  
TI  - Molecular beacons: trial of a fluorescence-based solution hybridization technique for ecological studies with ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Molecular beacons are fluorescent probes developed for solution rather than membrane hybridization. We have investigated the utility of these probes to study rumen microbial ecology. Two cellulolytic species, Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter succinogenes, were tested. Membrane and solution hybridizations gave similar results in competition experiments with cocultures of R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85.
TI  - Competition for cellobiose among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria  under substrate-excess and substrate-limited conditions.
AB  - The ruminal cellulolytic bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and Fibrobacter  succinogenes S85 coexisted in substrate-excess coculture with about equal population size, but R. flavefaciens outcompeted F. succinogenes for cellobiose in the substrate-limited cocultures whether the two strains were coinoculated or a steady-state culture of F. succinogenes was challenged by R. flavefaciens. This outcome of competition between these two strains is due to a classical pure and simple competition mechanism based on affinity for cellobiose. Although the population size of F. succinogenes was much higher (> 70%) than that of another cellulolytic species, Ruminococcus albus 7 in substrate-excess coculture, F. succinogenes was replaced by a population of R. albus in the substrate-limited coculture in both coinoculation and challenge experiments. R albus outcompeted F. succinogenes, apparently due to selection in the chemostat of a population of R. albus with a higher affinity for cellobiose. R. albus also outcompeted R. flavefaciens under substrate-limited conditions.
TI  - Competition for cellulose among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria under substrate-excess and substrate-limited conditions.
AB  - Three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and Ruminococcus albus 7) were grown in different binary combinations to determine the outcome of competition in either cellulose-excess batch culture or in cellulose-limited continuous culture. Relative populations of each species were estimated by using signature membrane-associated fatty acids and/or 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. Both F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens coexisted in cellulose-excess batch culture with similar population sizes (58 and 42%, respectively; standard error, 12%). By contrast, under cellulose limitation R. flavefaciens predominated (> 96% of total cell mass) in coculture with F. succinogenes, regardless of whether the two strains were inoculated simultaneously or whether R. flavefaciens was inoculated into an established culture of F. succinogenes. The predominance of R. flavefaciens over F. succinogenes under cellulose limitation is in accord with the former's more rapid adherence to cellulose and its higher affinity for cellodextrin products of cellulose hydrolysis. In batch cocultures of F. succinogenes and R. albus, the populations of the two species were similar. However, under cellulose limitation, F. succinogenes was the predominant strain (approximately 80% of cell mass) in cultures simultaneously coinoculated with R. albus. The results from batch cocultures of R. flavefaciens and R. albus were not consistent within or among trials: some experiments yielded monocultures of R. albus (suggesting production of an inhibitory agent by R. albus), while others contained substantial populations of both species. Under cellulose limitation, R. flavefaciens predominated over R. albus (85 and 15%, respectively), as would be expected by the former's greater adherence to cellulose. The retention of R. albus in the cellulose-limited coculture may result from a combination of its ability to utilize glucose (which is not utilizable by R. flavefaciens), its demonstrated ability to adapt under selective pressure in the chemostat to utilization of lower concentrations of cellobiose, a major product of cellulose hydrolysis, and its possible production of an inhibitory agent.
TI  - Why don't ruminal bacteria digest cellulose faster?
AB  - The bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus generally are regarded as the predominant cellulolytic microbes in the rumen. Comparison of available data from the literature reveals that these bacteria are the most actively cellulolytic of all mesophilic organisms described to date from any habitat. In light of numerous proposals to improve microbial cellulose digestion in ruminants, it is instructive to examine the characteristics of these species that contribute to their superior cellulolytic capabilities and to identify the factors that prevent them from digesting cellulose even more rapidly. As a group, these species have extreme nutritional specialization. They are able to utilize cellulose (or in some cases xylan) and its hydrolytic products as their nearly sole energy sources for growth. Moreover, each species apparently has evolved to similar maximum rates of cellulose digestion (first-order rate constants of 0.05 to 0.08 h-1). Active cellulose digestion involves adherence of cells to the fibers via a glycoprotein glycocalyx, which protects cells from protozoal grazing and cellulolytic enzymes from degradation by ruminal proteases while it retains-at least temporarily-the cellodextrin products for use by the cellulolytic bacteria. These properties result in different ecological roles for the adherent and nonadherent populations of each species, but overall provide an enormous selective advantage to these cellulolytic bacteria in the ruminal environment. However, major constraints to cellulose digestion are caused by cell-wall structure of the plant (matrix interactions among wall biopolymers and low substrate surface area) and by limited penetration of the nonmotile cellulolytic microbes into the cell lumen. Because of these constraints and the highly adapted nature of cellulose digestion by the predominant cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen, transfer of cellulolytic capabilities to noncellulolytic ruminal bacteria (e.g., by genetic engineering) that display other desirable properties offers limited opportunities to improve ruminal digestion of cellulose.
TI  - Identification and characterization of cellulose-binding domains in xylanase A of Clostridium stercorarium.
AB  - The xynA gene encoding a major xylanase of Clostridium stercorarium F-9 was sequenced. The structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1533 bp encoding a protein of 511 amino acids with an M(r) of 56,519. XynA consists of a catalytic domain belonging to family G at the NH2-terminus and two direct repeats of about 90 amino acids with a short spacing at the COOH-terminus. The repeated sequences, CBDI and CBDII, were not homologous with amino acid sequences of the CBDs classified into families I to V. Nevertheless, XynA showed an affinity for insoluble cellulose such as Avicel. Binding of XynA to Avicel was strongly dependent on the concentration of the incubation buffer and was inhibited by Triton X-100. XynA bound to Avicel (2.4 nmol/g-cellulose) and acid-swollen cellulose (180 nmol/g-cellulose), suggesting that this enzyme has higher affinity for amorphous cellulose than for crystalline cellulose. Functions of CBDI and CBDII were investigated by constructing the mutant enzymes and evaluating the cellulose-binding ability of each of them. XynA4 lacking CBDI and XynA5 lacking CBDII bound to Avicel to a lesser extent than the parental enzyme XynA; but XynA6, devoid of both CBDs, did not bind at all, indicating that CBDI and CBDII each functioned independently as CBD in XynA and their binding capacity was additive. Although the Ruminococcus albus endoglucanase EgIV that was joined to CBDs of XynA acquired cellulose-binding ability, the substrate specificity of EgIV was not altered in the presence or absence of CBDs.
TI  - Utilization of individual cellodextrins by three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Growth of the ruminal bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and R. albus 7 followed Monod kinetics with respect to concentrations of individual pure cellodextrins (cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and cellohexaose). Under the conditions tested, R. flavefaciens FD-1 possesses the greatest capacity to compete for low concentrations of these cellodextrins.
TI  - An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene (celA) from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus albus 8: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional analysis.
AB  - A genomic library of Ruminococcus albus 8 DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli using bacteriophage lambda ZapII. This library was screened for cellulase components and several Ostazin brilliant red/carboxymethyl cellulose positive clones were isolated. All of these clones contained a common 3.4-kb insert, which was recovered as a plasmid by helper phage excision. The carboxymethyl cellulase coding region was localized to a 1.4-kb region of DNA by nested deletions, and a clone containing the entire celA gene was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed a 1231-bp open reading frame, coding for a protein of 411 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45 747. This protein, designated CelA, showed extensive homology with family 5 endoglucanases by both primary amino acid sequence alignment and hydrophobic cluster analysis. Cell-free extracts of E. coli containing the celA clone demonstrated activity against carboxymethyl cellulose and acid swollen cellulose but not against any of the p-nitrophenol glycosides tested, indicating an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase type of activity. In vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that three proteins of 48,000, 44,000, and 23,000 molecular weight were produced by clones containing the celA gene. Northern analysis of RNA extracted from R. albus 8 grown on cellulose indicated a celA transcript of approximately 2700 bases, whereas when R. albus 8 was grown on cellobiose, celA transcripts of approximately 3000 and 600 bases were detected. Primer extension analysis of these RNAs revealed different transcription initiation sites for the celA gene when cells were grown with cellulose or cellobiose as the carbon source. These two sites differed by 370 bases in distance. A model, based on transcription and sequence data, is proposed for celA regulation.
TI  - Bioconversion of Cellulose to Acetate with Pure Cultures of Ruminococcus albus and a Hydrogen-Using Acetogen.
AB  - Bioconversion of cellulose to acetate was accomplished with cocultures of two organisms. One was the cellulolytic species Ruminococcus albus. It ferments crystalline cellulose (Avicel) to acetate, ethanol, CO(inf2), and H(inf2). The other organism (HA) obtains energy for growth by using H(inf2) to reduce CO(inf2) to acetate. HA is a gram-negative coccobacillus that was isolated from horse feces. Coculture of R. albus with HA in batch or continuous culture alters the fermentation products formed from crystalline cellulose by the ruminococcus via interspecies H(inf2) transfer. The major product of the fermentation by R. albus and HA coculture is acetate. High concentrations of acetate (333 mM) were obtained when batch cocultures grown on 5% cellulose were neutralized with Ca(OH)(inf2). Continuous cocultures grown at retention times of 2 and 3.1 days produced 109 and 102 mM acetate, respectively, when fed 1% cellulose with utilization of 84% of the substrate.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
TI  - Enumeration of transconjugated Ruminococcus albus and its survival in the goat rumen microcosm.
AB  - A transconjugant Ruminococcus albus A3 culture was released into a goat rumen, and the extent of its survival in the rumen microcosm was measured by distinguishing this bacterium from indigenous microbes by antibiotic resistance. A3 cells remained roughly constant for 14 days in this goat rumen.
TI  - Response to various amounts of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on ruminal metabolism in cattle.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract stimulated or inhibited ruminal fermentation when fed at higher than recommended doses (3 g/d). Four dietary treatments of A. oryzae fermentation extract were fed daily to six cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. For each of four periods, bromegrass hay (6% CP) with and without extract was fed for 28 d. Dacron bags containing bromegrass cell walls were ruminally incubated to determine ruminal fiber degradation. The A. oryzae fermentation extract did not affect degradation of cell walls, cellulose, or hemicellulose. Total ruminal anaerobic or cellulolytic bacteria were not different among treatments; neither were the proportions of cellulolytic species, Butyrivibrio sp., Ruminococcus albus, or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Ruminal ammonia was not different; however, total VFA were higher, and pH tended to be lower, when 27 g/d of A. oryzae fermentation extract was fed. The proportion of VFA was not different among treatments. The A. oryzae fermentation extract fed at nine times the recommended dosage did not produce any stimulatory effects, except for total VFA, and was not inhibitory or toxic to ruminal metabolism and forage fiber degradation.
TI  - The use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: pure-culture studies with cellulose and alkaline peroxide-treated wheat straw.
AB  - Specific oligonucleotide probes targeted to sites on the 16S rRNA of Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and a domain Bacteria probe were used to study bacterial interactions during the fermentation of cellulose and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw in monocultures, dicultures, and tricultures. Results showed that R. albus 8 inhibited the growth of R. flavefaciens FD-1 when grown as a diculture with cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw as the carbon source. In dicultures containing R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85 grown on cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw, competition was not detected. R. flavefaciens FD-1 outcompeted F. succinogenes S85 when cellulose was used as the carbon source. In tricultures with cellulose as the carbon source, R. flavefaciens FD-1 was inhibited, R. albus 8 appeared to dominate during the early phase of degradation (12 to 48 h), while F. succinogenes S85 became predominant during the later phase of degradation (60 to 70 h). When alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw was used as a growth substrate, F. succinogenes S85 showed better growth than either R. albus 8 or R. flavefaciens FD-1. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 was present in small numbers throughout the incubation period, unlike the growth patterns when cellulose was the carbon source.
TI  - The use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: development of probes for Ruminococcus species and evidence for bacteriocin production.
AB  - A total of six oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the 16S rRNA, were evaluated for quantitative and determinative studies of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. On the basis of specificity studies, probes for R. albus (probe RAL196) and R. flavefaciens (probe RFL196) were selected to quantitate these species in mixed culture. In combination with a Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 subspecies probe (SUB1) and a domain Bacteria (formerly kingdom Eubacteria) probe (EUB338), they were used to quantitate these species competing in mixed cultures for cellobiose as the carbon source. In dicultures containing R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85, competition was not observed. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 eventually outcompeted F. succinogenes S85 when cellobiose was the substrate. When R. albus 8 and R. flavefaciens FD-1 were grown together on cellobiose medium, R. albus 8 outcompeted R. flavefaciens FD-1, resulting in undetectable R. flavefaciens 16S rRNA only 1 to 3 h after inoculation, suggesting production of an antagonistic compound by R. albus 8 during rapid growth on soluble substrates. Further, when R. albus 8, R. flavefaciens FD-1, and F. succinogenes S85 were grown together in a triculture, R. flavefaciens FD-1 16S rRNA was detectable for only 2 h after inoculation, while R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85 showed a similar competition pattern to that of the dicultures. The results show that the Ruminococcus probes were effective in the measurement of relative populations of selected R. albus and R. flavefaciens strains during in vitro competition studies with F. succinogenes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  - The maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus prevotii, 3% in Ruminococcus albus, 4% in Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptococcus niger and Megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in Peptococcus magnus. The biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
TI  - Pentose utilization by the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus is an important fibrolytic ruminal bacteria which degrades hemicellulose and ferments the resulting pentose sugars. However, little information is available on the utilization of pentoses by this organism or the effect of hexose sugars on pentose metabolism. Enzymatic studies indicated that R. albus metabolized pentoses via the pentose phosphate pathway and possessed constitutive transketolase activity. Cellobiose was preferred over xylose and arabinose, and it appeared that the disaccharide decreased pentose metabolism by repression of transport activity and catabolic enzymes (isomerases and kinases). Glucose and xylose were co-utilized, and transport studies suggested that there was a common transport system for both sugars. In contrast, glucose was preferred over arabinose and the hexose noncompetitively inhibited the transport of arabinose. Since R. albus lacks a glucose phosphotransferase system, the inhibition of arabinose uptake could not be explained by previously described models of inducer exclusion involving such a system. Because accumulation of radiolabeled xylose, arabinose, and glucose proceeded in the absence of a proton motive force and since transport was correlated with the intracellular ATP concentration, it appeared that monosaccharide uptake was driven by ATP hydrolysis.
TI  - Utilization of xylooligosaccharides by selected ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of ruminal bacteria to utilize xylooligosaccharides was examined. Xylooligosaccharides were prepared by partially hydrolyzing oat spelt xylan in phosphoric acid. This substrate solution was added (0.2%, wt/vol) to a complex medium containing yeast extract and Trypticase that was inoculated with individual species of ruminal bacteria, and growth and utilization were monitored over time. All of the xylanolytic bacteria examined were able to utilize this oligosaccharide mixture as a growth substrate. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium ruminantium, and Ruminococcus albus used xylooligosaccharides and whole, unhydrolyzed xylan to similar extents, while Prevotella ruminicola used twice as much xylooligosaccharides as xylan (76 versus 34%). Strains of Selenomonas ruminantium were the only nonxylanolytic species that were able to grow on xylooligosaccharides. The ability of individual S. ruminantium strains to utilize xylooligosaccharides was correlated with the presence of xylosidase and arabinosidases activities.
TI  - Cellobiose versus glucose utilization by the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Cellulose degradation and metabolism in the rumen can be adversely affected by the presence of soluble sugars, but relatively little information is available on substrate preferences of cellulolytic bacteria. When the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus was incubated with a combination of cellobiose and glucose, the organism preferentially utilized the disaccharide. This preference appeared to be related to repression of glucose uptake systems in cellobiose-grown cells. Glucose transport kinetics exhibited low- and high-affinity uptake, and high-affinity transport was apparently driven by ATP hydrolysis. Bacterial yield in continuous culture was as much as 38% greater when the organism was grown on cellobiose versus glucose, and the increased yield could be partially attributed to constitutive cellobiose phosphorylase activity. The maintenance coefficient of glucose-grown cells was significantly greater than that of cells provided with cellobiose (0.225 g of glucose per g of protein per h versus 0.042 g of cellobiose per g of protein per h), and this result suggested that more energy was devoted to glucose uptake. Substrate affinities were examined in carbon-excess continuous culture, and affinities for glucose and cellobiose were relatively low (0.97 and 3.16 mM, respectively). Although R. albus maintained a proton motive force of approximately 60 mV from pH 6.7 to 5.5, growth ceased below pH 6.0, and this inhibition of growth may have been caused by a depletion of ATP at low pH.
TI  - Interactions between proteolytic and cellulolytic rumen bacteria during hydrolysis of plant cell wall protein.
AB  - During the degradation of the plant cell wall protein of dried alfalfa, interactions may occur between hydrolytic activities of cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus or Fibrobacter succinogenes) and proteolytic (Prevotella ruminicola or Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) bacteria. In vitro the hydrolysis of these protein compounds begins after the depolymerization of the cell wall polysaccharides has started. Maximal degradation of cell wall protein of dried alfalfa (37.2%) was obtained with cocultures of Prevotella ruminicola and Ruminococcus albus.
TI  - The inhibition of fungal cellulolysis by cell-free preparations from ruminococci.
AB  - The degradation of filter paper by the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis  strain RE1 was reduced by the addition of cell-free supernates from cultures of Ruminococcus albus strain J6 and R. flavefaciens strains 17 and 007. Fungal uptake of, and growth on, glucose was not affected. After gel permeation and anion exchange chromatography, inhibitory activity towards fungal cellulolysis was recovered in a fraction from strain 17 that contained at least five negatively charged polypeptide components, molecular mass 45-68 kDa, on SDS-PAGE.
TI  - Plasmid transformation of Ruminococcus albus by means of high-voltage electroporation.
AB  - To apply recombinant DNA techniques to the genetic manipulation of cellulolytic ruminal bacteria, a plasmid vector transformation system must be available. The objective of this work was to develop a system for plasmid transformation of Ruminococcus albus. Using high voltage electrotransformation, pSC22 and pCK17 plasmid vectors, derived from lactic acid bacteria plasmids and replicating via single-stranded DNA intermediate, were successfully introduced into three freshly isolated R. albus strains and into R. albus type strain ATCC 27210. The optimization of the electrotransformation condition raised the electroporation efficiency up to 3 x 10(5) transformants per microgram of pSC22 plasmid.
TI  - Partial purification and characterization of Ral8I, a class-IIS restriction endonuclease from Ruminococcus albus 8 which recognizes 5'-GGATC.
AB  - Heparin-agarose chromatography was used to isolate a restriction endonuclease (ENase) from the cellulolytic Gram+ anaerobe, Ruminococcus albus 8. The enzyme, Ral8I, was eluted from the column using 230-310 mM Na+. However, the preparation was active only with DNA substrates that were not Dam-methylated. Moreover, the restriction fragment pattern generated from simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA was not consistent with the expected number of Dam-methylation sites. Alignment of the Dam-methylation sites in SV40 DNA indicated that Ral8I may actually recognize the asymmetric sequence, GGATC. This was confirmed by nucleotide (nt) sequence analysis and, further, Ral8I was found to cause cleavage of the DNA approx. 5 nt downstream from the recognition sequence. Ral8I can therefore be classified as a type-IIS restriction endonuclease and is an isoschizomer of AlwI, BinI and BthII.
TI  - Partial characterization of a DNA restriction endonuclease from Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and its inhibition by site-specific adenine methylation.
AB  - The principal DNA restriction-modification system of the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 is described. The restriction endonuclease RflFI could be separated from cell extracts by phosphocellulose and heparin-sepharose chromatography. Restriction enzyme digests utilizing RflFI alone or in combination with SalI, a restriction enzyme isolated from Streptomyces albus G, showed that the DNA sequence recognized by RflFI either overlapped or was the same as that recognized by SalI. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that RflFI was identical in activity to SalI, with the recognition sequence being 5'-GTCGAC-3' and cleavage occurring between G and T. Adenine methylation within this sequence can be catalyzed in vitro by TaqI methylase, and this inhibited the cleavage of plasmid DNA molecules by RflFI and SalI. Chromosomal DNA from R. flavefaciens FD-1 is also methylated within this DNA sequence because neither restriction endonuclease could degrade this DNA substrate. These findings provide a means to protect plasmid molecules from degradation prior to gene transfer experiments with R. flavefaciens FD-1.
TI  - Cloning of a beta-glucosidase gene from Ruminococcus albus and its expression in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - A HindIII fragment of R. albus DNA encoding beta-glucosidase was cloned into E. coli. The DNA sequence (3158 bp) was determined, and the longest potential encoding sequence consisted of 2,841 bp (947 amino acids with the calculated molecular weight of 104,276. The deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence from the first (methionine) to the twentieth (glycine) was identical to that of the purified enzyme, suggesting that the gene for beta-glucosidase does not encode a signal peptide. The enzyme purified from the culture supernatant of the transformant had a molecular weight of 120,000 and its maximum activity was revealed at pH 6.5 and 30 degrees C. Reducing reagents activated the enzyme, whereas the sulfhydryl group-blocking reagents and reaction products (glucose) inhibited the activity. Hydrolyzates of celloorigomers contained glucose as a major product, indicating that the enzyme acts as beta-glucosidase. The enzyme from the transformant revealed similar properties to that from R. albus, and both enzyme proteins were immunologically the same to each other, indicating that the cloned gene encodes beta-glucosidase from R. albus.
TI  - Degradation of cellulose and forage fiber fractions by ruminal cellulolytic bacteria alone and in coculture with phenolic monomer-degrading bacteria.
AB  - We hypothesized that bacterial species capable of metabolizing phenolic monomers  may act as catalysts for forage fiber breakdown by increasing microbial access to cell wall polysaccharides. Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria alone and in combination with phenolic-degrading bacteria were examined for differences in their ability to degrade fiber fractions of alfalfa or bromegrass. Electron micrographs of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 cultured in combination with the ruminal phenolic-degrading organisms Eubacterium oxidoreducens G41 and Syntrophococcus sucromutans S195 indicated that bromegrass was degraded more extensively by the triculture than by the monoculture. The sequential detergent system was used to quantify the digestibility of fiber components from alfalfa and bromegrass. F. succinogenes incubated with the two phenolic-degrading organisms did not degrade more cell wall material than did F. succinogenes alone. However, with two other ruminal cellulolytic organisms, Clostridium longisporum B6405 and Ruminococcus albus B6403, greater (P less than .05, P less than .10, respectively) amounts of hemicellulose were degraded (72 h in vitro fermentation) from whole-plant alfalfa when E. oxidoreducens and S. sucromutants were combined with the cellulolytic species than when their monocultures were tested. Similar increases were not observed using a NDF preparation of alfalfa as the substrate. Based on these in vitro experiments, it does not seem that E. oxidoreducens and S. sucromutans play an important role in improving forage fiber degradation by cellulolytic ruminal bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of hybrid proteins consisting of the catalytic domains of Clostridium and Ruminococcus endoglucanases, fused to Pseudomonas non-catalytic cellulose-binding domains.
AB  - The N-terminal 160 or 267 residues of xylanase A from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, containing a non-catalytic cellulose-binding domain (CBD), were fused to the N-terminus of the catalytic domain of endoglucanase E (EGE') from Clostridium thermocellum. A further hybrid enzyme was constructed consisting of the 347 N-terminal residues of xylanase C (XYLC) from P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, which also constitutes a CBD, fused to the N-terminus of endoglucanase A (EGA) from Ruminococcus albus. The three hybrid enzymes bound to insoluble cellulose, and could be eluted such that cellulose-binding capacity and catalytic activity were retained. The catalytic properties of the fusion enzymes were similar to EGE' and EGA respectively. Residues 37-347 and 34-347 of XYLC were fused to the C-terminus of EGE' and the 10 amino acids encoded by the multiple cloning sequence of pMTL22p respectively. The two hybrid proteins did not bind cellulose, although residues 39-139 of XYLC were shown previously to constitute a functional CBD. The putative role of the P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa CBD in cellulase action is discussed.
TI  - Sequence of a cellulase gene from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.
AB  - A cellulase gene (endA) was isolated from a library of Ruminococcus flavefaciens  strain 17 DNA fragments inserted in pUC13. The endA product showed activity against acid-swollen cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, lichenan, cellopentaose and cellotetraose, but showed no activity against cellotriose or binding to avicel. Nucleotide sequencing indicated an encoded product of 455 amino acids which showed significant sequence similarity (ranging from 56% to 61%) with three endoglucanases from Ruminococcus albus, and with Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase E. Little relatedness was found with a cellodextrinase previously isolated from R. flavefaciens FD1.
TI  - The hydrolysis of lucerne cell-wall monosaccharide components by monocultures or  pair combinations of defined ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The defined ruminal bacterial strains Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus  flavefaciens FD1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, and Bacteroides ruminicola GA33 were grown, in monocultures or as combinations of pair strains, on isolated lucerne cell-walls (CW) as the sole carbohydrate substrate. Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was the dominant strain determining extent of CW hydrolysis in all combinations with S85. The hydrolysis of cellulose, xylan, hemicellulose side-sugars, and total CW monosaccharides by pure S85 were: 58.8, 47.3, 66.9 and 57.0%, respectively. The strains combination S85 plus D1 comprised the highest complementary effect, increasing significantly the hydrolysis of cellulose and total CW monosaccharides by 16% and 13%, respectively, above the values obtained by pure S85. This complementation was expressed also in growth pattern of bacteria. The monocultures of FD1, D1 and GA33 had very little hydrolytic effect on lucerne cellulose, but higher effects on xylan and hemicellulose side-sugars. The combinations D1 plus GA33 and 7 plus GA33 were complementary in the hydrolysis of all CW polysaccharides. The combinations FD1 plus D1, FD1 plus GA33, and 7 plus D1 were complementary only with respect to hemicellulose hydrolysis. On the other hand, the cellulolytic combinations S85 plus FD1, S85 plus 7 and FD1 plus 7 demonstrated negative interactions in lucerne CW polysaccharides hydrolysis. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), S85 comprised the most dense layer of bacterial cell mass attached to and colonized on CW particles. The cell surface topology of the cellulolytic strains S85, FD1 and 7 attached to CW particles was specified by a coat of characteristic protuberant structures.
TI  - Degradation of wheat straw and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw by  Ruminococcus albus 8 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
AB  - Degradation of wheat straw (WS) and alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP)-treated wheat straw (AHPWS) by Ruminococcus albus 8 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was determined by measuring the growth (OD600) of each bacterium and determining DM disappearance (DMD) of the substrate. Complex medium and defined medium with or without the addition of phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA) were used. Tubes were incubated at 39 degrees C for 8 d. Both OD600 and DMD indicated that AHPWS was degraded to a much greater extent by either bacterium (R. flavefaciens FD-1, 60.8 +/- 1.8% and R. albus 8, 42.3 +/- 3.5%) vs untreated WS (R. flavefaciens FD-1, 16.5 +/- 1.8% and R. albus 8, 8.6 +/- 6%) in the complex medium. Most degradation occurred between d 1 and 4. With the complex medium, addition of PPA and PAA did not stimulate degradation by either bacterium. When the defined medium was used, the addition of PPA and PAA enhanced (P less than .05) degradation of AHPWS (39.6 +/- 2.6%) vs AHPWS with no added PPA and PAA (24.9 +/- 7.6%) by R. albus 8. There was no synergistic effect on degradation when the two species were co-cultured with either WS or AHPWS as the substrate. No effect of PPA and PAA on disappearance of AHPWS was observed for R. flavefaciens FD-1 or when the two bacteria were grown together. Dry matter disappearance analysis showed that R. flavefaciens FD-1 degraded AHPWS more rapidly (6.1 mg/d) than R. albus 8 did (4.2 mg/d) in complex medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Modification of the properties of a Ruminococcus albus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase by gene truncation.
AB  - An endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (EgI) gene isolated from Ruminococcus albus was deleted at the 5'-flanking region by gene truncation or at the 3'-flanking region by insertion of an omega (omega) fragment with a universal stop codon at the EcoRI or BamHI site. These modified genes were integrated into pUC vectors to construct chimera plasmids for Escherichia coli. The truncated EgIs were produced from transformants (E. coli) harboring the chimera plasmids. An EgI with a 15-amino-acid N-terminal deletion exibited higher activity at lower pH and temperature compared with the activity of the original EgI. The EgIs with 59- and 75-amino-acid deletions from the N and C terminals, respectively, had no activity, indicating that both terminal moieties are essential for enzyme activity.
TI  - 3-Phenylpropanoic Acid Improves the Affinity of Ruminococcus albus for Cellulose  in Continuous Culture.
AB  - A continuous-culture device, adapted for use with solid substrates, was used to evaluate the effects of 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) upon the ability of the South African strain Ruminococcus albus Ce63 to ferment cellulose. Steady states of fermentation were established with a dilution rate of 0.17 h, and the extent and volumetric rates of cellulose fermentation were determined over four consecutive days. When the growth medium contained no additions (control), 25 muM phenylacetate alone, 25 muM PPA alone, or 25 muM each of phenylacetate and PPA, the extent of cellulose hydrolysis was determined to be 41.1, 35.7, 90.2, and 86.9%, respectively, and the volumetric rate of cellulose hydrolysis was 103.0, 97.9, 215.5, and 230.4 mg liter h, respectively. To evaluate the effect of PPA availability on affinity for cellulose, the values for dilution rate and extent of cellulose hydrolysis were used in combination with values for maximum specific growth rate determined from previous studies of growth rates and kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis. The findings support the contention that PPA maintains a competitive advantage for R. albus when grown in a dynamic, fiber-rich environment.
TI  - Mode of action and substrate specificity of a purified exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase cloned from the cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus albus AR67.
AB  - A gene encoding exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase, from Ruminococcus albus AR67, was cloned in Escherichia coli, restriction mapped, and shown to be expressed from sequences within the insert that function as a promoter in E. coli. The cloned enzyme was located predominantly in the cytoplasm (40%) and attached to insoluble cell components (48%). After purification to homogeneity, the enzyme (Mr = 64,000, monomeric) was specific for substrates with beta-D-glucopyranosyl configuration and was inactive against alpha-glucosides, lactosides and xylosides. Km values of the enzyme decreased with increasing chain length (G2-G5). Glucose was the major product of hydrolysis from cellodextrins. Preference for longer chain cellodextrins is consistent with exo-1,4-beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase mode of action [E.C. 3.2.1.74].
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Ruminococcus albus SY3 endoglucanase genes celA and celB.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Ruminococcus albus genes celA and celB coding for endoglucanase A (EGA) and endoglucanase B (EGB), respectively, have been determined. The celA structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. Confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by N-terminal analysis of purified EGA. The celB structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227 bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celB is a typical gram-positive Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The deduced N-terminal region of EGB conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. The complete celB gene, cloned into pUC vectors, caused lethality in Escherichia coli. In contrast, celA cloned in pUC18, under the control of lacZp, directed high-level synthesis of EGA in E. coli JM83. EGA in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a Mr of 44.5 kDa. Gene deletion and subcloning studies with celA revealed that EGA hydrolysed both CMC and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. EGA and EGB showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with Eg1 (R. albus), EGE (Clostridium thermocellum) and End (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).
TI  - Hydrophobic cluster analysis: procedures to derive structural and functional information from 2-D-representation of protein sequences.
AB  - Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) [15] is a very efficient method to analyse and compare protein sequences. Despite its effectiveness, this method is not widely used because it relies in part on the experience and training of the user. In this article, detailed guidelines as to the use of HCA are presented and include discussions on: the definition of the hydrophobic clusters and their relationships with secondary and tertiary structures; the length of the clusters; the amino acid classification used for HCA; the HCA plot programs; and the working strategies. Various procedures for the analysis of a single sequence are presented: structural segmentation, structural domains and secondary structure evaluation. Like most sequence analysis methods, HCA is more efficient when several homologous sequences are compared. Procedures for the detection and alignment of distantly related proteins by HCA are described through several published examples along with 2 previously unreported cases: the beta-glucosidase from Ruminococcus albus is clearly related to the beta-glucosidases from Clostridum thermocellum and Hansenula anomala although they display a reverse organization of their constitutive domains; the alignment of the sequence of human GTPase activating protein with that of the Crk oncogene is presented. Finally, the pertinence of HCA in the identification of important residues for structure/function as well as in the preparation of homology modelling is discussed.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4 endoglucanase gene.
AB  - Bacteroides ruminicola B(1)4, a noncellulolytic rumen bacterium, produces an endoglucanase (carboxymethylcellulase [CMCase]) that is excreted into the culture supernatant. Cultures grown on glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, and cellobiose had high specific activities of CMCase (greater than 3 mmol of reducing sugar per mg of protein per min), but its synthesis was repressed by sucrose. B. rumincola did not grow on either ball-milled or acid-swollen cellulose even though the CMCase could hydrolyze swollen cellulose. The CMCase gene was cloned into Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for a protein of 40,481 daltons. The enzyme was overproduced in E. coli under the control of the tac promoter and purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and molecular weight of the purified enzyme were similar to the values predicted from the open reading frame of the DNA sequence. However, the CMCase present in B. ruminicola was found to have a monomer molecular weight of 88,000 by Western immunoblotting. This discrepancy appeared to have resulted from our having cloned only part of the CMCase gene into E. coli. The amino acid sequence of the CMCase showed homology to sequences of beta-glucanases from Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - Antigenic nature of the chloride-stimulated cellobiosidase and other cellulases of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 and related fresh isolates.
AB  - Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 reacted with numerous proteins of both higher and lower molecular weights from F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85, but not with Escherichia coli proteins, and only one protein each from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Ruminococcus albus. Different profiles were observed for Western blots (immunoblots) of peptide digests of both the purified enzyme from F. succinogenes and immunoreactive proteins of higher and lower molecular weights, demonstrating that they were different proteins. Therefore, F. succinogenes appeared to produce numerous proteins with one or more common antigenic determinants. However, with the exception of Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, none were cellulases that have been characterized. An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase reacted with numerous proteins in cells of each of three fresh isolates of F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes and one of F. succinogenes subsp. elongata when analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies to periplasmic cellodextrinase, endoglucanase 2 (EG2), and EG3, when reacted in Western blots with the various cellulases, including Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, revealed limited antigenic similarity among the different proteins and none with either B. fibrisolvens or R. albus proteins. The periplasmic cellodextrinase antibody reacted with an antigen with a size corresponding to cellodextrinase in each of the three F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes isolates but not with any antigens from the F. succinogenes subsp. elongata isolate. The anti-EG2 antibody reacted with single antigens in each of the four isolates, while the anti-EG3 antibody reacted with only one of the four isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - DNA sequence of a beta-glucosidase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  
TI  - Modification of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Ruminococcus albus by gene truncation.
AB  
TI  - Structure of a Ruminococcus albus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase I (Eg I) gene from Ruminococcus albus cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli with pUC18 was fully sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method. The sequence contained a consensus promoter sequence and a structural amino acid sequence. The initial 43 amino acids of the protein were deduced to be a signal sequence, since they are missing in the mature protein (Eg I). High homology was found when the amino acid sequence of the Eg I was compared with that of endoglucanase E from Clostridium thermocellum. Codon usage of the gene was not biased. These results suggested that the properties of the Eg I gene from R. albus was specified from the known beta-glucanase genes of the other organisms.
TI  - Degradation of barley straw, ryegrass, and alfalfa cell walls by Clostridium longisporum and Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The recently isolated ruminal sporeforming cellulolytic anaerobe Clostridium longisporum B6405 was examined for its ability to degrade barley straw, nonlignified cell walls (mesophyll and epidermis) and lignified cell walls (fiber) of ryegrass, and alfalfa cell walls in comparison with strains of Ruminococcus albus. R. albus strains degraded 20 to 28% of the dry matter in barley straw in 10 days, while the clostridium degraded less than 2%. A combined inoculum of R. albus SY3 and strain B6405 was no more efficient than SY3 alone, and the presence of Methanobacterium smithii PS did not increase the amount of dry matter degraded. In contrast, with alfalfa cell walls as the substrate, the clostridium was twice as active (28% weight loss) as R. albus SY3 (15%). The percentages of dry matter degraded from ryegrass cell walls of mesophyll, epidermis, and fiber for the clostridium were 50, 47, and 32%, respectively, and for R. albus SY3 they were 77, 73, and 63%, respectively. Analyses of the predominant neutral sugars (arabinose, xylose, and glucose) in the plant residues after bacterial attack were consistent with the values for dry matter weight loss. Measurements of the amount of carbon appearing in the fermentation products indicated that R. albus SY3 degraded ryegrass mesophyll cell walls most rapidly, with epidermis and fiber cell walls being degraded at similar rates. Strain B6405 attacked alfalfa cell walls at a rate greater than that of any of the ryegrass substrates. These results indicate an unexpected degree of substrate specificity in the ability of C. longisporum to degrade plant cell wall material.
TI  - The isolation and comparison of cellulase genes from two strains of Ruminococcus  albus.
AB  - Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase genes have been cloned from two strains of Ruminococcus albus recently isolated in this laboratory. Although the strains were phenotypically similar, cross-hybridization studies between them showed significant genetic differences, with only 20% of the genome forming DNA heteroduplexes. Heteroduplexes displayed an average dissociation temperature 9 degrees C lower than that of the homoduplex. Consistent with this, restriction maps of the two endoglucanase genes showed no similarity, and hybridization work using the endoglucanase genes as probes revealed that neither gene was present in the genome of the other isolate of R. albus. Comparative enzyme characterization showed differences between the enzymes in their response to temperature, pH and substrate preference.
TI  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. The total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x 10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7) to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. The genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of Entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of Diplodiniinae was higher (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. Bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (P less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). This was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic Butyrivibrio isolates. The numbers of Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although R. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. In vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (P less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. The concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Kinetics of Insoluble Cellulose Fermentation by Continuous Cultures of Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Data from analyses of continuous culture fermentation of insoluble cellulose by Ruminococcus albus 7 were used to derive constants for the rate of cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation, growth yield, and maintenance. Cellulose concentration was 1% in the nutrient reservoir, and hydraulic retention times of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.0 days were used. Concentrations of reducing sugars in the cultures were negligible (less than 1%) compared with the amount of hydrolyzed cellulose, indicating that cellulose hydrolysis was the rate-limiting step of the fermentation. The rate of utilization of cellulose depended on the steady-state concentration of cellulose and was first order with a rate constant (k) of 1.18 day. The true microbial growth yield (Y) was 0.11 g g, the maintenance coefficient (m) was 0.10 g g h, and the maximum Y(ATP) was 7.7 g of biomass (dry weight) mol of ATP.
TI  - Fermentation of Insoluble Cellulose by Continuous Cultures of Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The hydrolysis and fermentation of insoluble cellulose (Avicel) by continuous cultures of Ruminococcus albus 7 was studied. An anaerobic continuous culture apparatus was designed which permitted gas collection, continuous feeding, and wasting at different retention times. The operation of the apparatus was controlled by a personal computer. Cellulose destruction ranged from ca. 30 to 70% for hydraulic retention times of 0.5 to 2.0 days. Carbon recovery in products was 92 to 97%, and the oxidation-reduction ratios ranged from 0.91 to 1.15. The total product yield (biomass not included) per gram of cellulose (expressed as glucose) was 0.83 g g, and the ethanol yield was 0.41 g g. The product yield was constant, indicating that product formation was growth linked.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and extrachromosomal DNA content of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - Seventeen Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens strains have been screened for naturally occurring antibiotic resistance, as determined by zones of inhibition from antibiotic disks. These strains were also examined for extrachromosomal DNA content. All strains screened are resistant to low levels (10-200 micrograms/mL) of streptomycin. In contrast to the previously reported data, we have found that R. flavefaciens C-94 is now susceptible to both kanamycin and tetracycline. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 is not susceptible to kanamycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 40 micrograms/mL). Furthermore, R. albus 8 is resistant to tetracycline (MIC = 40 micrograms/mL), and erythromycin (MIC = 100 micrograms/mL). Six freshly isolated strains showed resistance to tetracycline (35-70 micrograms/mL), and all tetracycline-resistant strains also showed resistance to minocycline. None of these Ruminococcus determinants share homology with the streptococcal tetL, tetM, or tetN determinants. All 17 strains were screened for extrachromosomal DNA content. Nine different techniques for the detection and isolation of extrachromosomal DNA were tested. However, owing to difficulties in demonstrating or isolating plasmid DNA, it has not been possible to determine if these antibiotic resistance genes are plasmid borne. Evidence is presented to suggest that the presence of oxygen may affect the quality of the DNA obtained from Ruminococcus.
TI  - Escherichia coli Spheroplast-Mediated Transfer of pBR322 Carrying the Cloned Ruminococcus albus Cellulase Gene into Anaerobic Mutant Strain FEM29 by Protoplast Fusion.
AB  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Escherichia coli HB101 with pBR322 carrying the cloned o-(carboxymethyl)cellulase (CMCase) gene of Ruminococcus albus (Pro Leu Ap Km) and an anaerobic mutant strain, FEM29 (Trp His Ap Km), with dehydrodivanillin-degrading activity was performed in the presence of 40% polyvinyl alcohol 300 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to transfer the cloned cellulase gene into the mutant. The mutant FEM29 had a unique property. When it was incubated in liquid medium with 1% glucose and sucrose, protoplasts could be produced autogenously and regenerated on the agar slant. E. coli spheroplasts formed from a plasmid-amplified overnight culture after 10 min of treatment with lysozyme (20 mug/ml) in a hypertonic solution (0.01 M Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.5], 0.4 M mannitol). Protoplast regeneration rates of FEM29 and HB101 were 30 and 83%, respectively, on the agar-yeast extract medium. Ap Km fusants were obtained at high frequency: 1.7 x 10 anaerobically and 8.2 x 10 aerobically. These fusants showed 23 to 57% of CMCase and dehydrodivanillin-degrading activities, respectively, as compared with parental strains. All the fusants isolated were gram-negative rods with main phenotypes such as urease and catalase activities as in HB101 and esterase and chymotrypsin activities as in FEM29. Southern hybridization experiments suggested that pBR322 with the cloned CMCase gene existed autonomously in the fusant cells. This is the first report describing transfer of pBR322 with a cloned cellulase gene into an anaerobic mutant by polyvinyl alcohol-mediated fusion with an E. coli spheroplast.
TI  - Molecular Cloning and Expression of Cellulase Genes from Ruminococcus albus 8 in  Escherichia coli Bacteriophage lambda.
AB  - A genomic library of Ruminococcus albus 8 DNA was constructed by using the Escherichia coli bacteriophage lambdaDASH. Recombinants were screened for cellulolytic activity by plating in soft agar (0.7%) overlays containing either 1% (wt/vol) carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobioside (MUC, 1 mg/ml), or 1% (wt/vol) Ostazin brilliant red-hydroxyethyl cellulose (OBR-HEC). One hundred and three recombinant phage exhibiting activity against OBR-HEC were found, and these fell into different classes based on the size of the zone of hydrolysis. Twenty-one recombinant phage exhibiting activity against CMC and 19 recombinant phage exhibiting activity against MUC were isolated. Four OBR-HEC, five CMC, and seven MUC clones were further analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and cellulase substrate specificity to identify unique clones and to determine their cellulase type. Three different clone types representing endoglucanase activity were identified. Three clones that appeared to encode exoglucanase type activity and four clones that had a mixed specificity, including beta-glucosidase activity, were also identified.
TI  - Cloning of the cellulase gene from Ruminococcus albus and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene for cellulase from Ruminococcus albus F-40 was cloned in Escherichia coli HB101 with pBR322. A 3.4-kilobase-pair HindIII fragment encoding cellulase hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of R. albus. The Ouchterlony double-fusion test gave a single precipitation line between the cloned enzyme and the cellulase from R. albus. The size of the cloned fragment was reduced by using HindIII and EcoRI. The resulting active fragment had a size of 1.9 kilobase pairs; and the restriction sites EcoRI, BamHI, PvuII, EcoRI, PvuII, and HindIII, in that order, were ligated into pUC19 at the EcoRI and HindIII sites (pURA1). Cellulase production by E. coli JM103(pURA1) in Luria-Bertani broth was remarkably enhanced, up to approximately 80 times, by controlling the pH at 6.5 and by reducing the concentration of NaCl in the broth to 80 mM.
TI  - Intergeneric Protoplast Fusion between Ruminococcus albus and an Anaerobic Recombinant, FE7.
AB  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium (Pc Sm Km), and an anaerobic recombinant, FE7 (Pc Sm Km), having lignin-related compound-degrading activities, was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to introduce cellulase genes into strain FE7. The fusion frequency varied with different selected markers from 3.0 x 10 to 3.3 x 10. Two fusants, obtained from a synthetic medium with selective pressures of penicillin and streptomycin and with cellooli-gomer as the sole carbon source, were gram-negative rods. One of them, named FE7R2, showed 45 to 47% of the beta-glucosidase and cellobiosidase activities of its parent R. albus and still maintained a level of degradation activity against dehydrodivanillin, a lignin-related compound, of up to 87% of that of the parent strain FE7. To verify that the cellulolytic activities expressed in the fusant FE7R2 originated from R. albus cellulase genes, the beta-glucosidase gene of R. albus was cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 with plasmid pBR322. Cells bearing a recombinant plasmid, pRAII, produced high enzyme activities against both p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside and could degrade cellobiose to glucose. Southern blot results showed that the cloned DNA fragment could hybridize with chromosomal DNAs of both R. albus and FE7R2, but did not with the chromosomal DNA of FE7, indicating that the beta-glucosidase gene fragment was introduced into the chromosome of FE7R2 from R. albus via the protoplast fusion. The fusant FE7R2 could utilize simultaneously both cellobiose and dehydrodivanillin. These results gave evidence that the fusion product FE7R2 is a recombinant strain between its parents R. albus and FE7. This recombinant has stably kept the above properties for about 2 years.
TI  - Fermentation of xylans by Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria (6 species, 18 strains) to ferment a crude xylan from wheat straw or to ferment xylans from larchwood or oat spelts was studied. Liquid cultures were monitored for carbohydrate utilization, cell growth (protein), and fermentation acid production. B. fibrisolvens 49, H17c, AcTF2, and D1 grew almost as well on one or more of the xylans as they did on cellobiose-maltose. B. fibrisolvens 12, R28, A38, X10C34, ARD22a, and X6C61 exhibited moderate growth on xylans. Partial fermentation of xylans was observed with Bacteroides ruminicola B14, Bacteroides succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94 and FD1, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 22B. All xylans tested appeared to have a small fraction of carbohydrate that supported low levels of growth of nonxylanolytic strains such as Selenomonas ruminantium HD4. Compared to growth on hexoses, the same array of fermentation acids was produced upon growth on xylans for most strains; however, reduced lactate levels were observed for B. fibrisolvens 49 and Selenomonas ruminantium HD4. Measurements of enzyme activities of B. fibrisolvens AcTF2, 49, H17c, and D1 indicated that the xylobiase activities were cell associated and that the xylanase activities were predominantly associated with the culture fluid. The pattern of expression of these enzymes varied both between strains and between the carbon sources on which the strains were grown.
TI  - Effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mM). The growth of Eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of Streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. The MICs of the ionophores for strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. High concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of Selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. Increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mM) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mM). The data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.
TI  - Electron microscopic study of the methylcellulose-mediated detachment of cellulolytic rumen bacteria from cellulose fibers.
AB  - The presence of methylcellulose prevents the attachment of cellulolytic rumen bacteria to cellulose fibers. The addition of methylcellulose to pure cultures of these organisms in which the cells are already adherent to cellulose causes their detachment from this insoluble substrate and the inhibition of their growth. Methylcellulose is not used as a carbon source by these organisms and has no effect on their growth when glucose and cellobiose are the carbon sources. Attached cells of Bacteroides succinogenes orient themselves in the plane of the individual cellulose fibers and their methylcellulose-induced detachment, which is complete (almost 100%), leaves grooves where the cellulose has been digested. Attached cells of Ruminococcus albus colonize the cellulose in a looser and less regular pattern and their almost complete methylcellulose-induced detachment leaves less regular pits in the cellulose surface. On the other hand, attached cells of Ruminococcus flavefaciens colonize the cellulose surface in a random orientation by means of a discernible exopolysaccharide network, and their less complete methylcellulose-induced detachment leaves no residual impressions on the cellulose surface. These data support the suggestion that bacterial attachment is necessary for the digestion of highly ordered crystalline cellulose, and that cellulolytic species differ in the nature of their attachment to this insoluble substrate and in the nature of their enzymatic attack. Methylcellulose is an effective agent for detaching major rumen cellulolytic bacteria from their cellulosic substrate.
TI  - Interactions between Treponema bryantii and cellulolytic bacteria in the in vitro degradation of straw cellulose.
AB  - To assess the contribution of individual bacterial species to the overall process of cellulose digestion in the rumen, cellulolytic bacteria (Bacteroides succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus) were tested as pure cultures and as cocultures with noncellulolytic Treponema bryantii. In studies of in vitro barley straw digestion, Treponema cocultures surpassed pure cultures of the cellulolytic organisms in dry matter disappearance, volatile fatty acid generation, and in the production of succinic acid, lactic acid, and ethanol. Morphological examination, by electron microscopy, showed that cells of T. bryantii associate with the plant cell wall materials in straw, but that cellulose digestion occurs only when these organisms are present with cellulolytic species such as B. succinogenes. These results show that cellulolytic bacteria interact with noncellulolytic Treponema to promote the digestion of cellulosic materials.
TI  - Seasonal changes in the cecal microflora of the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  - The dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic Svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal pH was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter, when it is very poor. In summer the total culturable viable bacterial population was (8.9 +/- 5.3) X 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) X 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. Of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. Streptococcus bovis represented 17% in summer and 5% in winter. Bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and 26% in winter. In summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. The most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was Ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. The most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was Bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. The cecal bacterial of the Svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. The cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.
TI  - Effect of phenolic monomers on ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Ruminal bacteria were subjected to a series of phenolic compounds in various concentrations to acquire fundamental information on the influence on growth and the potential limits to forage utilization by phenolic monomers. Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Lachnospira multiparus D-32 were tested against 1, 5, and 10 mM concentrations of sinapic acid, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and hydrocinnamic acid. Responses were variable and dependent on the phenolic compound and microbial species. Compounds especially toxic (i.e., resulting in poor growth, effect on several species, dose-related response) were p-coumaric acid and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and adaptation to the toxins did not occur after three 24-h periods. Syringic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and hydrocinnamic acids stimulated growth of all four species and also stimulated filter paper degradation by R. flavefaciens. None of the stimulatory compounds supported microbial growth in the absence of carbohydrates. In vitro dry matter digestibility of cellulose (Solka-Floc) was not stimulated by any of the phenolic compounds (10 mM), but the cinnamic acids and benzoic aldehydes (10 mM) reduced (P less than 0.05) digestion by the mixed population in ruminal fluid. Growth of R. flavefaciens in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (10 mM) or p-coumaric acid (5 mM) resulted in recognizable alterations in cell ultrastructure. Both phenolics caused a reduction in cell size (P less than 0.05), and p-coumaric acid caused a reduction in capsular size (P less than 0.05) and produced occasional pleomorphic cells.
TI  - Palladium-Mediated Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons with Hydrogen Gas Released during Anaerobic Cellulose Degradation.
AB  - Among five hydrogenation catalysts, palladium on charcoal was the most reactive one when suspended in anaerobic culture medium, and Lindlar catalyst (Pd on CaCO(3)) was the most reactive one when suspended in the gas phase of culture tubes. Palladium on charcoal in the culture medium (40 to 200 mg 10 ml) completely inhibited growth of Neocallimastix frontalis and partly inhibited Ruminococcus albus. Lindlar catalyst (40 to 200 mg per tube) suspended in a glass pouch above the culture medium did not affect the rate of cellulose degradation or the ratio of fermentation products by these organisms. Acetylene added to tubes containing Lindlar catalyst in pouches, and either of the two organisms in monoculture or coculture with Methanospirillum hungatei, was reduced to ethylene and then ethane, followed by hydrogen production. Similar results were obtained with 1-pentene. Neither acetylene nor 1-pentene affected cellulose degradation but both inhibited methanogenesis. In the presence of Lindlar catalyst and propylene or 1-butene, fermenter-methanogen cocultures continued to produce methane at the same rate as controls and no olefin reduction occurred. Upon addition of bromoethanesulfonic acid, methanogenesis stopped and olefin reduction took place followed by hydrogen evolution. In a gas mixture consisting of propylene, 1-butene, and 1-pentene, the olefins were reduced at rates which decreased with increasing molecular size. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of combining in one reactor the volatile fatty acid production by anaerobic digestion with chemical catalyst-mediated reductions, using the valuable by-product hydrogen.
TI  - Influence of forage phenolics on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria and in vitro fiber degradation.
AB  - In vitro cultures of ruminal microorganisms were used to determine the effect of  cinnamic acid and vanillin on the digestibility of cellulose and xylan. Cinnamic acid and vanillin depressed in vitro dry matter disappearance of cellulose 14 and 49%, respectively, when rumen fluid was the inoculum. The number of viable Bacteroides succinogenes cells, the predominant cellulolytic organism, was threefold higher for fermentations which contained vanillin than for control fermentations. When xylan replaced cellulose as the substrate, a 14% decrease in the digestibility of xylan was observed with vanillin added; however, the number of viable xylanolytic bacteria cultured from the batch fermentation was 10-fold greater than that of control fermentations. The doubling time of B. succinogenes was increased from 2.32 to 2.58 h when vanillin was added to cellobiose medium, and absorbance was one-half that of controls after 18 h. The growth rate of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens was inhibited more by p-coumaric acid than by vanillin, although no reduction of final absorbance was observed in their growth cycles. Vanillin, and to a lesser extent cinnamic acid, appeared to prevent the attachment of B. succinogenes cells to cellulose particles, but did not affect dissociation of cells from the particles. B. succinogenes, R. albus, R. flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens all modified the parent monomers cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin, with B. fibrisolvens causing the most extensive modification. These results suggest that phenolic monomers can inhibit digestibility of cellulose and xylan, possibly by influencing attachment of the fibrolytic microorganisms to fiber particles. The reduced bacterial attachment to structural carbohydrates in the presence of vanillin may generate more free-floating fibrolytic organisms, thus giving a deceptively higher viable count.
TI  - Effect of 3-phenylpropanoic Acid on growth of and cellulose utilization by cellulolytic ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The growth of several cellulolytic species of ruminal bacteria was measured in media containing either cellobiose or cellulose as the energy source and with or without added 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PPA). With Ruminoccoccus albus 7 and 8, the addition of PPA greatly enhanced the rate of cellulose utilization but had little effect on the rate of growth when cellobiose was the energy source. Comparative rates of growth obtained on either cellobiose or cellulose for Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1 or C94 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 12, 49, or A38 were similar regardless of the PPA content of the growth medium.
TI  - Degradation of bermuda and orchard grass by species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Fiber degradation in Bermuda grass and orchard grass was evaluated gravimetrically and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy after incubation with pure cultures of rumen bacteria. Lachnospira multiparus D-32 was unable to degrade plant cell wall components. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 degraded 6 and 14.9% of the fiber components in Bermuda grass and orchard grass, respectively, and Ruminococcus albus 7 degraded 11.4% orchard grass fiber but none in Bermuda grass. Both B. fibrisolvens and R. albus lacked capsules, did not adhere to fiber, and degraded only portions of the more easily available plant cell walls. R. flavefaciens FD-1 was the most active fiber digester, degrading 8.2 and 55.3% of Bermuda and orchard grass fiber, respectively. The microbe had a distinct capsule and adhered to fiber, especially that which is slowly degraded, but was able to cause erosion and disorganization of the more easily digested cell walls, apparently by extracellular enzymes. Results indicated that more digestible cell walls could be partially degraded by enzymes disassociated from cellulolytic and noncellulolytic bacteria, and data were consistent with the hypothesis that the more slowly degraded plant walls required attachment. Microbial species as well as the cell wall architecture influenced the physical association with and digestion of plant fiber.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - A metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. To standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees C was generally less than 10 micrograms X mL-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and Streptococcus bovis Pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. In general, the Gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the Gram positive. The minimum inhibitory concentration for Bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms X mL-1; for B. ruminicola GA33 (glucose), B. succinogenes S85 (cellobiose), and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram X mL-1. When added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms X mL-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by B. succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, and R. flavefaciens FD1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms X mL-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. In the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of ammonia treatment on the solubilization of straw and the growth of  cellulolytic rumen bacteria.
AB  - Pre-treatment of straw with anhydrous ammonia increased its susceptibility to solubilization by the predominant cellulolytic bacteria from the rumen, Bacteroides succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. Ammonia treatment also increased the production of microbial protein and fermentation products by all three species. Scanning electron microscope observations of straw during digestion suggested that the attack of straw by these bacteria was accompanied by the formation of substantial numbers of adherent microcolonies.
TI  - Isolation and properties of beta-glucosidase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - An enzyme active against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside was purified from logarithmic-phase cells of Ruminococcus albus cultivated in a medium containing ball-milled cellulose. The purification yielded homogeneous enzyme after an approximately 520-fold increase in specific activity and a 9% yield. The enzyme was identified as a beta-glucosidase because it can hydrolyze cellobiose and cellooligosaccharides to glucose from the nonreducing ends.
TI  - Effect of 3-Phenylpropanoic Acid on Capsule and Cellulases of Ruminococcus albus  8.
AB  - The morphology and cellulases of Ruminococcus albus 8 were markedly affected by the inclusion of 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) in a defined growth medium. PPA-grown bacteria produced substantial quantities of cell-bound cellulase, as well as a very high-molecular-weight extracellular enzyme and lesser amounts of two low-molecular-weight enzymes. PPA-deprived bacteria produced greater total amounts of cellulase, but all of it exists in soluble, low-molecular-weight forms. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the availability of PPA did not affect the kinds of proteins produced, but the distribution of two major proteins between cells and supernatant was PPA dependent. These two proteins (85 and 102 kilodaltons) were primarily associated with the cells of PPA-grown bacteria but were found chiefly in the supernatants of PPA-deprived cultures. Examination of thin sections of PPA-grown R. albus 8 by transmission electron microscopy showed a lobed ruthenium red-staining capsule surrounding the cell wall, as well as small vesicular structures (diameter, 0.05 to 0.06 mum) which appeared to aggregate into larger spherical units (diameter, 0.2 to 0.3 mum). In contrast, thin sections of PPA-deprived cells were devoid of vesicles and showed little or no capsule surrounding the cells.
TI  - Muralytic Activities of Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus 8 was cultured with isolated alfalfa cell walls as the carbon  source. The culture broth was assayed for muralytic enzyme activities. The effect, with respect to the production of such muralytic enzymes, of growing the microorganism on different carbon sources was also investigated. Also, the rates of solubilization and utilization by R. albus of individual alfalfa cell wall sugars during a 96-h growth period were examined.
TI  - alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Ruminococcus albus 8: purification and possible  role in hydrolysis of alfalfa cell wall.
AB  - An alpha-L- arabinofuranosidase has been purified from the extracellular broth of cultures of Ruminococcus albus 8. The purification procedure utilized gel filtration, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, and isoelectric focusing. The purified enzyme appeared to be homogeneous when chromatographed on disc and analytical isoelectric focusing gels. The estimated molecular weight of the native protein was 305,000 to 310,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis analysis suggested that the native protein is a tetramer composed of 75,000-molecular-weight subunits. The enzyme appeared to have no metal cofactor requirement but was sensitive to several sulfhydryl reagents. The pH optimum with p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside as the substrate was 6.9 and the Km was 1.3 mM. Several lines of evidence indicated that the enzyme is a glycoprotein. When assayed against alfalfa cell wall material, the enzyme hydrolyzed only small amounts of arabinose from the substrate. When assayed together with hemicellulolytic or pectinolytic enzymes against the same substrate, the arabinosidase significantly enhanced the hydrolytic action of the glycanases .
TI  - Microtus species as new herbivorous laboratory animals: reproduction; bacterial flora and fermentation in the digestive tracts; and nutritional physiology.
AB  - In a study of the possible introduction of Japanese field vole (Microtus montebelli ) and Hungarian voles (M. arvalis) as herbivorous experimental animals, the following biological characteristics were investigated: breeding and reproductive performance; bacterial flora and fermentation in the digestive tracts; and nutritional physiology. The animals are polyestrus , show postpartum estrus on the day of parturition, and there is little or no delay in implantation due to lactation, especially in M. arvalis. On examination of vaginal smears, Japanese field vole did not show any definite pattern, whereas most Hungarian voles showed 6- to 18- day cycles. From the esophageal sac of voles fed rations with a high fiber content, cellulolytic bacteria similar to Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens , and Bacteroides succinogenes were isolated. More than 1 000 000/g anaerobic bacteria were present in the esophageal sac and the pattern and the types of bacteria resembled those found in the rumen. Gastric fermentation took place in the esophageal sac. The pH and total VFAs were much smaller in the fundic and pyloric regions of the stomach than in the esophageal sac. Acetic and lactic acids were the major fermentation products in the esophageal sac. Following deficiency or lowering of the cellulose decomposing abilities, a decrease of VFAs and an increase in lactic acid production in the esophageal sac were observed. These effects resulted in high glucose, FFA and ketone bodies in the blood, and a higher incidence of glucosuria. Diabetes induced by administrations of drugs such as alloxan, streptozotocin and phloridzin were compared using Microtus and mice. Microtus had low sensitivity to alloxan but high sensitivity to streptozotocin. The influence of monensin on Microtus was also investigated by using diets containing 20 and 80 mg/kg monensin. Diets containing 80 mg/kg monensin led to 50 % mortality in 7 weeks and growth was hindered. Gas production from the esophageal sac contents of voles in the monensin-medicated group was much smaller than that of the non-medicated group. In the monensin group the total VFA concentrations of the esophageal sac contents was decreased.
TI  - Effects of chetomin on growth and acidic fermentation products of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Chetomin, an antibiotic metabolite of Chaetomium spp., was tested in the form of  its tetrathiol derivative for its effects on growth and carbohydrate metabolism by five strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. The compound was bacteriostatic for the strains tested and Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition than Gram-negative bacteria. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chetomin which completely inhibited growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1 for 18 h at 39 degrees C was 40 micrograms X mL-1. The MICs determined under the same conditions for Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Selenomonas ruminantium GA192, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 were 160, 600, and 60 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. The MIC for cellulose hydrolysis by Ruminococcus albus 7 was 20 micrograms X mL-1. Chetomin at concentrations below the MIC appeared to inhibit the separation and division of cells in cultures of B. fibrisolvens D1. Chetomin consistently stimulated acetate production from glucose by B. fibrisolvens D1, M. elsdenii B159, and S. ruminantium GA192 at the expense of compounds which comprised major soluble end products of fermentation in cultures lacking chetomin.
TI  - Effect of soluble carbohydrates on digestion of cellulose by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - The rate of cellulose digestion in the presence of either glucose or cellobiose was studied for the three predominant species of cellulolytic rumen bacteria: Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Bacteroides succinogenes. When a soluble carbohydrate was added to cellulose broth, the lag phase of cellulose digestion was shortened. Presumably, this was due to greater numbers of bacteria, because increasing the size of the inoculum had a similar effect. Cellulose digestion occurred simultaneously with utilization of the soluble carbohydrate. The rate of cellulose digestion slowed markedly for B. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens and slowed less for R. albus after the cellobiose or glucose had been utilized, and was accompanied by a decrease in pH. Both the rate and the extent of cellulose digestion were partially inhibited when the initial pH of the medium was 6.3 or below. R. albus appeared to be less affected by a low-pH medium than were B. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens. When a soluble carbohydrate was added to the fermentation during the maximum-rate phase of cellulose digestion, the rate of cellulose digestion was not affected until after the soluble carbohydrate had been depleted and the pH had decreased markedly. Prolonged exposure of the bacteria to a low pH had little if any effect on their subsequent ability to digest cellulose. Cellulase activity of intact bacterial cells appeared to be constitutive in nature for these three species of rumen bacteria.
TI  - Phenylacetic acid stimulation of cellulose digestion by Ruminococcus albus 8.
AB  - The rate of cellulose digestion by Ruminococcus albus 8 grown on a defined medium could be increased by adding a minimum of 6.6% (vol/vol) rumen fluid. Strain 8 was grown on half this concentration, and the culture medium before and after growth was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine which components of the rumen fluid were used. Phenylacetic acid was identified as the component needed to make the defined medium nutritionally equivalent to one supplemented with rumen fluid. [14C]phenylacetic acid fed to cultures of strain 8 was primarily incorporated into protein. Hydrolysis of protein samples and separation of the resulting amino acids showed that only phenylalanine was labeled. The results indicate that cellulose digestion by strain 8 was probably limited by phenylalanine biosynthesis in our previously reported medium. The data obtained on the utilization of other rumen fluid components, as well as on the production of metabolites, illustrate the potential usefulness of this method in formulating defined media to simulate those in nature.
TI  - Influence of plant phenolic acids on growth and cellulolytic activity of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Isolated rumen bacteria were examined for growth and, where appropriate, for their ability to degrade cellulose in the presence of the hydroxycinnamic acids trans-p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid and the hydroxybenzoic acids vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Ferulic and p-coumaric acids proved to be the most toxic of the acids examined and suppressed the growth of the cellulolytic strains Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Bacteroides succinogenes when included in a simple sugars medium at concentrations of >5 mM. The extent of cellulose digestion by R. flavefaciens and B. succinogenes but not R. albus was also substantially reduced. Examination of rumen fluid from sheep maintained on dried grass containing 0.51% phenolic acids showed the presence of phloretic acid (0.1 mM) and 3-methoxyphloretic acid (trace) produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric and ferulic acids, respectively. The parent acids were found in trace amounts only, although they represented the major phenolic acids ingested. Phloretic and 3-methoxyphloretic acids proved to be considerably less toxic than their parent acids. All of the cellulolytic strains (and Streptococcus bovis) showed at least a limited ability to hydrogenate hydroxycinnamic acids, with Ruminococcus spp. proving the most effective. No further modification of hydroxycinnamic acids was produced by the single strains of bacteria examined. However, a considerable shortfall in the recovery of added phenolic acids was noted in media inoculated with rumen fluid. It is suggested that hydrogenation may serve to protect cellulolytic strains from hydroxycinnamic acids.
TI  - Phenylpropanoic Acid: Growth Factor for Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Phenylpropanoic acid accounted for part of the stimulatory effect of rumen fluid  on the rate of growth and of cellulose digestion by cultures of Ruminococcus albus strain 8 grown on a chemically defined medium. As little as 3 muM concentration gave maximum response.
TI  - Preparation of the cellulase from the cellulolytic anaerobic rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus and its release from the bacterial cell wall.
AB  - 1. Most of the cellulase (CM-cellulase) elaborated by the rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus strain SY3, which was isolated from a sheep, was cell-wall-bound. 2. The enzyme could be released readily by washing either with phosphate buffer or with water. 3. The amount of enzyme released was affected by the pH and ionic strength of the phosphate buffer. 4. The cell-wall-bound enzyme was of very high molecular weight (>>1.5x10(6)) as judged by its chromatographic behaviour on Sephacryl S-300. 5. The molecular weight of the extracellular enzyme was variable and depended on the culture conditions. 6. When cellobiose was used as the energy source and the medium contained rumen fluid (30%), the extracellular enzyme was, in the main, of high molecular weight. 7. When cellulose replaced the cellobiose, the cell-free culture filtrate contained only low-molecular-weight enzyme (M(r) approx. 30000) in late-stationary-phase cultures (7 days). 8. Cultures that did not contain rumen fluid contained mainly low-molecular-weight enzyme. 9. Under some conditions the high-molecular-weight enzyme could be broken down to some extent into low-molecular-weight enzyme by treatment with dissociating agents. 10. Cell-free and cell-wall-bound enzymes showed the same relationship when the change in fluidity effected by them on a solution of CM-cellulose was plotted against the corresponding increase in reducing sugars, suggesting that the enzymes were the same. 11. It is possible that R. albus cellulase exists as an aggregate of low-molecular-weight cellulase components on the bacterial cell wall and in solution under certain conditions.
TI  - Purification and properties of cellobiosidase from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - An enzyme active against p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside was purified from Ruminococcus albus to homogeneity. The enzyme was identified as a cellobiosidase.
TI  - Effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  - Lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium cellulosolvens, E. ruminantium, Lachnospira multiparus, Lactobacillus ruminis, L. vitulinus, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis). Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. Among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (Bacteroides, Selenomonas, Succinimonas, Succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Also, none of the major lactate fermenters (Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. Hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. Lasalocid and monensin appeared to inhibit selectively the production of L(+), but not D(-) lactic acid. The inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus and Lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants.
TI  - Nutritional Interdependence Among Rumen Bacteria, Bacteroides amylophilus, Megasphaera elsdenii, and Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Nutritional interdependence among three representatives of rumen bacteria, Bacteroides amylophilus, Megasphaera elsdenii, and Ruminococcus albus, was studied with a basal medium consisting of minerals, vitamins, cysteine hydrochloride, and NH(4). B. amylophilus grew well in the basal medium supplemented with starch and produced branched-chain amino acids after growth ceased. When cocultured with B. amylophilus in the basal medium supplemented with starch and glucose, amino acid-dependent M. elsdenii produced an appreciable amount of branched-chain fatty acids, which are essential growth factors for cellulolytic R. albus. A small addition of starch (0.1 to 0.3%) to the basal medium containing glucose and cellobiose brought about successive growth of the three species in the order of B. amylophilus, M. elsdenii, and R. albus, and successive growth was substantiated by the formation of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids in the culture. Supplementation with 0.5% starch, however, failed to support the growth of R. albus. On the basis of these results, the effects of supplementary starch or branched-chain fatty acids on cellulose digestion in the rumen was discussed.
TI  - Effect of pH on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  - A total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Lactobacillus vitulinus GA1, Bacteroides ruminicola B14, B. ruminicola GA33, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94, and Bacteroides succinogenes S85, were grown in energy-limiteH of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 pH units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and pH were determined. A low pH appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. Large variations were seen among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower pH values and in the pH at which the culture washed out. Lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of pH on the efficiency of protein synthesis in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.
TI  - Molybdate and sulfide inhibit H2 and increase formate production from glucose by  Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - H2 production from glucose by Ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) M molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. Inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. Extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. Active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. The results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form H2 are used to reduce CO2 to formate. Growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) M. Reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of H2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M molybdate. H2 production by R. bromei but not by R. flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Veillonella alcalescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
TI  - Effect of monensin and lasalocid-sodium on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria.
AB  - It is thought that monensin increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. We studied the effect of monensin and the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (Hoffman-LaRoche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Growth of Bacteroides succinogenes and Bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Populations of B. succinogenes and B. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 mug of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth in the presence of each drug at 5.0 mug/ml. Selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Either antibiotic (10 mug/ml) inhibited Methanobacterium MOH, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanosarcina barkeri MS. Methanobacterium ruminantium PS was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or 20 mug of lasalocid per ml. The methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin but sensitive to 10 mug of lasalocid per ml. The results suggest that monensin or lasalocid acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming Bacteroides and for S. ruminantium, a propionate producer that decarboxylates succinate to propionate. The selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. Selection against H(2) and formate producers, e.g. R. albus, R. flavefaciens, and B. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen.
TI  - [Effect of methanosarcina on the growth of primary anaerobes].
AB  - The effect of Methanosarcina vacuolata on the mixed celluloytic population and on pure cultures of anaerobic bacteria was studied. In the pasteurized enrichment culture decomposing cellulose but producing no methane, the biomass of primary anaerobes increased at a higher rate when Methanosarcina was introduced; the rate of cellulose hydrolysis did not change. Methanosarcina stimulated also the growth of Escherichia intermedia and Ruminococcus albus on a medium containing glucose and cellobiose. The growth of combined cultures with the production of methane was possible only on a medium with a low content of carbohydrates since an increase in the concentration of glucose inhibited the growth of Methanosarcina.
TI  - Fermentations by saccharolytic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Most nonsporing anaerobes of the intestinal tract use the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas  scheme to ferment carbohydrates. Almost all of them oxidize pyruvate, the key fermentation intermediate, to acetyl coenzyme A and CO2 with reduction of a low-potential electron acceptor. H2 is formed from the low potential acceptor or from NADH. Pyruvate is a precursor of lactate, and phosphoenolpyruvate is a precursor of succinate and propionate. Ethanol, acetate, and butyrate are formed from acetyl coenzyme A. Formate is produced by reduction of CO2 by Ruminococcus albus. Heme is required by human Bacteroides for the formation of succinate and, in the presence of vitamin B12, propionate. A fermentation equation derived from the concentration of volatile acids found in human feces suggests that the fermentation in the large intestine is similar to the rumen fermentation.
TI  - The extracellular cellulases of Ruminococcus albus.
AB  
TI  - Effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. The elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were Hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), Cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), Cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), Se4+ (73 microgram/ml), Ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), Cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), As3+ (304 microgram/ml) and As5+ (1610 microgram/ml). The elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included Zn2+, Cr2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Co2+. Methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. When the inhibitory effect of Cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. The inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic cultures of rumen bacteria. The bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were Bacteroides succinogenses, Ruminococcus albus, Bacteroides amylophilus, and Eubacterium ruminantium. Those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Megasphera elsdenii, while Streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. Rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.
TI  - Partial purification of ferredoxin from Ruminococcus albus and its role in pyruvate metabolism and reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by H2.
AB  - Extracts of Ruminococcus albus were not able to convert pyruvate to acetyl phosphate, CO2, and H2 after passage through a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column. Activity was restored by a brown protein fraction eluted from the column with 0.4 M Cl-. The protein was partially purified and shown to have the spectral and biological characteristics of ferredoxin. R. albus ferredoxin, Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin, and methyl viologen restored activity for pyruvate decomposition by DEAE-cellulose-treated R. albus extracts. R. albus or C. pasteurianum ferredoxin restored the ability of DEAE-cellulose-treated C. pasteurianum extracts to form H2 and acetyl phosphate from pyruvate. Ferredoxin-free extracts of R. albus reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) when supplemented with R. albus or C. pasteurianum ferredoxin or with methyl viologen. These extracts reduced NADP with H2 poorly unless both ferredoxin and NAD were added, which indicates the presence of an NADH:NADP transhydrogenase. Flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide were rapidly reduced by H2 by ferredoxin-free extracts in the absence of ferredoxin.
TI  - Cellulolytic cocci isolated from the cecum of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).
AB  - Five strains of anaerobic, gram-variable cellulolytic cocci, belonging to the genus Ruminococcus, were isolated from the cecum of a guinea pig. They differed from most previously described strains of cellulolytic ruminococci as follows. (i) Lactate was the major fermentation product; lesser amounts of formate and ethanol and a trace of succinate were also produced, along with an uptake of acetate. (ii) No growth occurred at 30 degrees C; however, good growth was observed at 38 and 45 degrees C, (iii) Glucose, cellobiose, cellulose, xylose, arabinose, xylan, sucrose, and lactose were fermented by all strains. Rumen fluid was required for growth in a complete medium containing all nutrients previously found to be required by species in this genus. Limited growth occurred when rumen fluid was replaced by yeast extract, and maximum, but delayed, growth occurred when a water extract of alfalfa was added to the complete medium. No qualitative differences were found in the cell wall amino acids and sugar composition of these strains as compared to Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus; however, cell walls of the guinea pig strains appeared to contain a higher proportion of glucose.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - Characterization of a Cytoplasmic Reserve Glucan from Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus, an anaerobic bacterium that digests cellulose in the rumen of cattle, produces intracellular polysaccharide granules varying from 0.05 to 0.31 mum in diameter when grown in batch culture. This polysaccharide material was purified and found to contain d-glucose as the only reducing sugar. The polyglucose polymer was slightly opalescent in aqueous solution and formed a strong reddish purple iodine complex with a maximum absorbance at 550 nm. Its infrared spectrum had characteristic absorption bands at 8.70, 9.25, and 9.75 mum and was identical with that of the amylopectin-glycogen type of Megasphaera elsdenii and that of the glycogen of enteric bacteria and beef liver. It reacted strongly with concanavalin A. Methylation analysis showed that the glucan contained 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-MeG-2,3,6-Tri-O-MeG-2,3-Di-O-MeG in a ratio of 8:84:8. Characterization of the products obtained by treatment with isoamylase indicates that the glucan of R. albus is of the glycogen type.
TI  - Studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: Bacteroides clostridiiformis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Enbacterium limosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Clostridium pasteurianum and Escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. Hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. All species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only C. pasteurianum, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii produced hydrogen from dithionite. All species except E. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but activity was low or absent in extracts of E. limosum, F. necrophorum, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. Hydrogen was produced from formate only by E. coli, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, F. necrophorum, and R. flavefaciens. Extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. The hydrogenase of all species except E. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. Treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with DEAE-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. Activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. It is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
TI  - The hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids by five bacterial isolates from the  sheep rumen, including a new species.
AB  - Five strictly anaerobic bacteria able to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids were isolated from sheep rumen. One was characterized as Ruminococcus albus, two as Eubacterium spp. and two as Fusocillus spp., one of which is named as a new species. The Fusocillus organisms were able to hydrogenate oleic acid and linoleic acid to stearic acid, and linolenic acid to cis-octadec-15-enoic acid. The R. albus and the two Eubacteria did not hydrogenate oleic acid but converted linoleic and linolenic acids to a mixture of octadecenoic acids; trans-octadec-II-enoic acid predominated but several isomeric cis and trans octadecenoic acids were produced together with isomers of non-conjugated octadecadienoic acids. The intermediate and final products of hydrogenation by each organism were compatible with the results from mixed rumen bacteria.
TI  - Ultrastructure and adhesion properties of Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Morphological studies have shown that cells of the anaerobic rumen bacterium Ruminococcus albus have electron-translucent granules of reserve carbohydrate in their cytoplasm, and that they have a polysaccharide "coat" layer external to their gram-negative cell wall. This coat layer, which stains specifically with ruthenium red, forms a compact mat of fibers adjacent to the cell, and fibrous elements also project as much as 0.6 mum from the cells. These radial fibers are clearly visualized by freeze-etching, and can be seen to extend throughout the extensive intercullular space in centrifuged pellets of these bacteria. Cells of R. albus adhere to cellulose fibers added to the culture medium, and the coat material is seen to mediate this adhesion in addition to its function in the general protection of these cells.

TI  - Tryptophan biosynthesis from indole-3-acetic acid by anaerobic bacteria from the  rumen.
AB  - Microbes in ruminal contents incorporated (14)C into cells when they were incubated in vitro in the presence of [(14)C]carboxyl-labeled indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Most of the cellular (14)C was found to be in tryptophan from the protein fractions of the cells. Pure cultures of several important ruminal species did not incorporate labeled IAA, but all four strains of Ruminococcus albus tested utilized IAA for tryptophan synthesis. R. albus did not incorporate (14)C into tryptophan during growth in medium containing either labeled serine or labeled shikimic acid. The mechanism of tryptophan biosynthesis from IAA is not known but appears to be different from any described biosynthetic pathway. We propose that a reductive carboxylation, perhaps involving a low-potential electron donor such as ferredoxin, is involved.
TI  - Formation of hydrogen and formate by Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - Radioisotopic growth studies with specifically labeled (14)C-glucose confirmed that Ruminococcus albus, strain 7, ferments glucose mainly by the Embden-Myerhof-Parnas pathway to acetate, ethanol, formate, CO(2), H(2), and an unidentified product. Cell suspensions and extracts converted pyruvate to acetate, H(2), CO(2), and a small amount of ethanol. Formate was not produced from pyruvate and was not degraded to H(2) and CO(2), indicating that formate was not an intermediate in the production of H(2) and CO(2) from pyruvate. Cell extract and (14)C-glucose growth studies showed that the H(2)-producing pyruvate lyase reaction is the major route of H(2) and CO(2) production. An active pyruvate-(14)CO(2) exchange reaction was demonstrable with cell extracts. The (14)C-glucose growth studies indicated that formate, as well as CO(2), arises from the 3 and 4 carbon positions of glucose. A formate-producing pyruvate lyase system was not demonstrable either by pyruvate-(14)C-formate exchange or by net formate formation from pyruvate. Growth studies with unlabeled glucose and labeled (14)CO(2) or (14)C-formate suggest that formate arises from the 3 and 4 carbon positions of glucose by an irreversible reduction of CO(2). The results of the studies on the time course of formate production showed that formate production is a late function of growth, and the rate of production, as well as the total amount produced, increases as the glucose concentration available to the organism increases.

TI  - Glucose fermentation products in Ruminococcus albus grown in continuous culture with Vibrio succinogenes: changes caused by interspecies transfer of H 2 .
AB  - The influence of a H(2)-utilizing organism, Vibrio succinogenes, on the fermentation of limiting amounts of glucose by a carbohydrate-fermenting, H(2)-producing organism, Ruminococcus albus, was studied in continuous cultures. Growth of V. succinogenes depended on the production of H(2) from glucose by R. albus. V. succinogenes used the H(2) produced by R. albus to obtain energy for growth by reducing fumarate in the medium. Fumarate was not metabolized by R. albus alone. The only products detected in continuous cultures of R. albus alone were acetate, ethanol, and H(2). CO(2) was not measured. The only products detected in the mixed cultures were acetate and succinate. No free H(2) was produced. No formate or any other volatile fatty acid, no succinate or other dicarboxylic acids, lactate, alcohols other than ethanol, pyruvate, or other keto-acids, acetoin, or diacetyl were detected in cultures of R. albus alone or in mixed cultures. The moles of product per 100 mol of glucose fermented were approximately 69 for ethanol, 74 for acetate, 237 for H(2) for R. albus alone and 147 for acetate and 384 for succinate for the mixed culture. Each mole of succinate is equivalent to the production of 1 mol of H(2) by R. albus. Thus, in the mixed cultures, ethanol production by R. albus is eliminated with a corresponding increase in acetate and H(2) formation. The mixed-culture pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form), formed during glycolysis by R. albus, is reoxidized during ethanol formation when R. albus is grown alone and is reoxidized by conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and H(2) when R. albus is grown with V. succinogenes. The ecological significance of this interspecies transfer of H(2) gas and the theoretical basis for its causing changes in fermentation patterns of R. albus are discussed.
TI  - Factors affecting cellulolysis by Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - The factors influencing the digestion of pebble-milled cellulose by enzymes were  studied by using several strains of Ruminococcus albus including a mutant characterized by a more eccentric location of its colony in the clearing produced by digestion of the cellulose in the thin layer lining the wall of a culture tube. Most of the cellulase is extracellular. As much as 65% of the cellulose could be digested by the cell-free enzymes provided the quantity of cellulose was small. Fresh enzyme was repeatedly administered or the digestion experiment was arranged in a dialysis bag through which digestion products could diffuse. Cellobiose and, to a lesser extent, glucose inhibited digestion. Pebble-milled filter paper, moist crystalline cellulose from cotton, and dry crystalline cellulose (Sigmacel) were digested, but in decreasing rapidity, respectively. Carboxymethylcellulose was digested more rapidly than pebble-milled cellulose but to approximately the same final extent as judged by Cu reduction values. Cell walls from alfalfa were digested. The enzyme preparation was active over the pH range 6.0 to 6.8 and showed most rapid cellulose digestion at 45 C. Part of the cellulolytic activity was irreversibly destroyed by exposure to oxygen. Much of the enzyme was absorbed on cellulose. The absorption and desorption characteristics, as well as the partial inhibition by oxygen, indicate that multiple enzymes are involved.
TI  - An anaerobic chemostat that permits the collection and measurement of fermentation gases.
AB  - A chemostat was designed to allow anaerobic growth in the culture vessel in the absence of a continuous stream of O(2)-free gas. Produced gases were collected within the culture and collection vessels, and pressure build-up was prevented by allowing gases to expand into a collapsed football bladder. The culture overflow was collected in a flask, held at 0 C, that was emptied by applying a positive CO(2) pressure to the system. Ruminococcus albus, a H(2) and CO(2)-producing anaerobe, was used to test the operation of the apparatus. H(2) production was measured by sampling the various gas spaces of known volume and measuring H(2) concentration by gas chromatography. Measurement of accumulated fermentation gases and the effects of the accumulation on fermentations can be studied with the apparatus.
TI  - Fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H10b and D16f, Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and D31d, Lachnospira multiparus D15d, Peptostreptococcus sp. D43e, B. succinogenes A3c, Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b, and R. albus 7). Only three strains, 23, D16f, and D31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except A3c and H10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. Nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. Pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. For bromegrass I, all strains tested (B34b, 23, D16f, D31d, D15d, and D43e) degraded a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of B34b, utilized most of what was degraded. Similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass II, except for the two strains of B. ruminicola, 23 and D31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. All strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and D31d. Synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, B34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, D31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. Similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains B34b and D16f; however, no increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
TI  - Carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  - The carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. Increasing concentrations of CO(2) were added as NaHCO(3) to a specially prepared CO(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. Prior depletion of CO(2) in the inoculum was found to affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. An absolute requirement for CO(2) was observed for eight strains of Bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains of Lachnospira multiparus, one strain of Succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Inconsistent growth responses were obtained in CO(2)-free media with one strain each of B. fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Growth of six additional strains of B. fibrisolvens, and single strains of Eubacterium ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of CO(2). Peptostreptococcus elsdenii B159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for CO(2). Higher concentrations of CO(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end products.
TI  - Volatile fatty acid requirements of cellulolytic rumen bacteria.
AB  - A gas chromatographic method was developed which could separate the isomers isovaleric and 2-methylbutyric acid. Subsequent analyses revealed that most commercially available samples of these acids were cross-contaminated; however, one sample of each acid was found to be pure by this criterion. The growth response of seven strains of cellulolytic rumen bacteria (three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, three strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and one strain of R. albus) to additions of isobutyric, isovaleric, 2-methylbutyric, valeric, and combinations of valeric and a branched-chain acid was determined. Strains of B. succinogenes required a combination of valeric plus either isobutyric or 2-methylbutyric acid. Isovaleric acid was completely inactive. Either isobutyric or 2-methylbutyric acid was required for the growth of R. albus 7. Strain C-94 of R. flavefaciens grew slowly in the presence of any one of the three branched-chain acids, but a combination of isobutyric and 2-methylbutyric acids appeared to satisfy this organism's growth requirements. None of the individual acids or mixtures of straight- and branched-chain acids allowed growth of R. flavefaciens strain C1a which would approach the response obtained from the total mixture of acids. Further work indicated that all three branched-chain acids were required for optimal growth by this strain, although isovaleric acid only influenced the rate of maximal growth. Either 2-methylbutyric or isovaleric acid allowed growth of nearly the same magnitude as that of the positive control for R. flavefaciens B34b. The presence of acetic acid had little influence on the rate or extent of growth of any of the strains except R. albus 7, for which the extent of growth was markedly increased. Determination of the quantitative fatty acid requirements for the three B. succinogenes strains indicated that 0.1 mumole of valeric per ml and 0.05 mumole of 2-methylbutyric per ml permitted maximal growth. However, with isobutyric acid as the branched-chain component, strains A3c and B21a required 0.1 mumole/ml in contrast to S-85 which exhibited optimal growth at the 0.05 mumole/ml level. By use of mixtures of isobutyric and 2-methylbutyric acids, good growth of C-94 was obtained at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.01 mumole/ml, respectively. About 0.3 mumole/ml of each acid was required for satisfactory growth of C1a.

AB  - Joyner, A. E., Jr. (University of California, Davis), and R. L. Baldwin. Enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-The activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. The effects of diet upon the activities of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, Bacteroides succinogenes, B. ruminicola, B. amylophilus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase). The cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. Enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
TI  - Cellulase from Ruminococcus albus and mixed rumen microorganisms.
AB  - Cellulase in the cultural filtrates of Ruminococcus albus and cellulase extracted from mixed rumen microorganisms were investigated with acid-swollen cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose as substrates. Maximal activity occurred at approximately pH 5.8 and 47 C. Apparent Michaelis constants (K(m)) varied between 0.53 and 0.02% carboxymethylcellulose, depending on the level of activity and the method of assay. R. albus cellulase has a lower K(m) value than the enzyme extracted from mixed rumen microorganisms. Antisera from rabbits immunized with a cellulase preparation from R. albus inhibited the cellulolytic activity of both systems. Based on the relative degree of inhibition, approximately 20% of the cellulase of the mixed rumen microorganisms was immunologically similar to R. albus cellulase. Ratios of activity in different assay techniques showed the two sources of activity to be similar in the mechanisms of degradation. However, glucose is the main product of cellulose degradation by mixed rumen microorganisms, and cellobiose is the product of degradation by R. albus.

Bacteriol. 89:1515-1520. 1965.-Hemicelluloses isolated from flax, corn hulls, alfalfa, oat hulls, and fescue grass were used as sole energy sources to study the ability of pure cultures of cellulolytic rumen bacteria to degrade and utilize these materials. From a total of eight bacterial strains tested (three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and one strain of Ruminococcus albus), only three strains of ruminococci were able to utilize the hemicelluloses for growth. Hemicellulose fermentation mixtures were analyzed for total pentose, residual hemicellulose (pentose precipitated in 80% ethyl alcohol), and ethyl alcohol-soluble pentose. The three strains of ruminococci were able to partially utilize the different hemicelluloses as energy sources, as determined by total pentose loss, and they were capable of almost complete degradation of the original hemicellulose from an ethyl alcohol-insoluble to ethyl alcohol-soluble form. The extent of both degradation and utilization varied markedly between the three strains and different substrates. Tests on the other strains indicated that no growth, production of organic acid end products, or appreciable loss of total pentose had occurred. However, analysis of the culture medium for residual hemicellulose indicated that these strains were able to extensively degrade the original hemicelluloses to an ethyl alcohol-soluble form. Marked differences were observed among strains and hemicelluloses in the amount of hemicellulose degraded. Of the different hemicelluloses, corn-hull hemicellulose was the most resistant to degradation and utilization by the cellulolytic rumen bacteria.
TI  - POLYSACCHARIDE STORAGE AND GROWTH EFFICIENCY IN RUMINOCOCCUS ALBUS.
AB  - Hungate, R. E. (University of California, Davis). Polysaccharide storage and growth efficiency in Ruminococcus albus. J. Bacteriol. 86:848-854. 1963.-Ruminococcus albus strain RAM requires biotin, p-aminobenzoic acid, pyridoxamine, isovalerate, isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate, and either cysteine or sulfide. Rumen fluid and casein hydrolysate improve growth but are not essential. Up to 35% iodophilic polysaccharide is stored in cells from batch cultures and 17% in a continuous culture on a 10-hr cycle. The storage product is a polymer of glucose resembling starch. The yield of cells in continuous culture, corrected for stored starch, averaged 102 mg per mmole of cellobiose fermented to waste products. It is postulated that nine high-energy phosphates are derived from each cellobiose molecule. Conversions providing this number are discussed.

AB  - Allison, M. J. (Dairy Cattle Research Branch, USDA, Beltsville, Md.), M. P. Bryant, I. Katz, and M. Keeney. Metabolic function of branched-chain volatile fatty acids, growth factors for ruminococci. II. Biosynthesis of higher branched-chain fatty acids and aldehydes. J. Bacteriol. 83:1084-1093. 1962.-A number of strains of rumen bacteria require branched-chain volatile fatty acids for growth. A strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens that requires either isovalerate or isobutyrate incorporates radioactive carbon from isovalerate-1-C(14) and isovalerate-3-C(14) into leucine and into the lipid fraction of the cells. Evidence obtained by both paper and gas chromatography indicated that most of the label in the lipid of cells grown in isovalerate-1-C(14) was in a branched-chain 15-carbon fatty acid, with some in a 17-carbon acid; about 7.5% of the C(14) was recovered in a branched-chain 15-carbon aldehyde. The aldehydes were in the phospholipid fraction and were presumably present as plasmalogen.A strain of R. albus was shown to require isobutyrate, 2-methyl-n-butyrate, or 2-ketoisovalerate for growth. This strain did not incorporate appreciable C(14) from isovalerate-1-C(14) or isovalerate-3-C(14). When grown in a medium containing isobutyrate-1-C(14), most of the cellular C(14) was found in the lipid fraction. Analysis of the lipid demonstrated that the label was present mainly as branched-chain 14-carbon and 16-carbon fatty acids, with 11% of the C(14) present in 14- and 16-carbon carbonyl compounds, presumably branched-chain aldehydes.Branched-chain 14-, 15-, and 16-carbon fatty acids are major components of the lipids of these rumen bacteria. The possibility that these acids and aldehydes, which are found in ruminant body and milk lipids, may be of microbial origin is discussed.
