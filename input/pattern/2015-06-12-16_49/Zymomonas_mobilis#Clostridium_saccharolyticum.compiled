TI  - Influence of the presence of Zymomonas anaerobia on the conversion of cellobiose, glucose, and xylose to ethanol by Clostridium saccharolyticum.
AB  - To convert sugar mixtures containing cellobiose, glucose, and xylose to ethanol in a single step, the possibility of using a coculture consisting of Clostridium saccharolyticum and Zymomonas anaerobia was studied. In monoculture, C. saccharolyticum utilized all three sugars; however, it preferentially utilized glucose and produced acetic acid in addition to ethanol. The formation of acetic acid from the metabolism of glucose inhibited the growth of C. saccharolyticum and, consequently, the utilization of cellobiose and xylose. In monoculture, Z. anaerobia utilized glucose at a rate of 50 g/L day, but it did not ferment cellobiose or xylose. In coculture, Z. anaerobia converted most of the glucose to ethanol during the lag phase of growth of C. saccharolyticum, which then converted cellobiose and xylose to ethanol. The use of this coculture increased both the rate and the efficiency of the conversion of these three sugars to ethanol, and produced relatively small amounts of acetic acid.
