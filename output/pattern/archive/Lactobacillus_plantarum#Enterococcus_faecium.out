plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by two strains of lactobacillus plantarum isolated from beloura and chourico, traditional pork products from portugal.
bacteriocins bacst202ch and bacst216ch, produced by lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from beloura and chourico, respectively, inhibited the growth of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative meat spoilage bacteria. according to trycine-sds-page, bacst202ch and bacst216ch are approximately 3.5 and 10.0 kda in size, respectively. maximal activity of bacst202ch (25,600 au/ml) was recorded after 27 h of and bacst216ch (102,400 au/ml) after 22 h of growth. the mode of activity, as determined against enterococcus faecium hklhs, is bactericidal. both peptides adsorb to the surface of the producer cells, but at very low concentrations. both peptides remained active after 120 min at 100 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0. treatment for 120 min at 121 degrees c did not affect bacst216ch activity. activity of bacst202ch and bacst216ch was not affected by 1% triton x-100, tween 80, tween 20, sds, nacl, urea and edta. bacteriocin st216ch was deactivated in the presence of 1% triton x-114. the nucleotide sequence of a 1044 bp dna fragment amplified from l. plantarum st202ch is identical to the structural gene encoding pediocin pa-1, suggesting that the two bacteriocins are identical. based on the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, strains st202ch and st216ch may be used as starter cultures in the fermentation of meat products.
coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.
[study of some properties of strain lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) antagonistic factor].
the screening of strains which expressed antagonistic activity, that is not connected with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide synthesis was conducted among 72 cultures of lactic acid bacteria. the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) which inhibited growth of 11 test-cultures including lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium was selected. the antibacterial factor was of protein nature, did not retain the activity after boiling and was active at ph 2.0-8.0, whereas at ph 9.0 its activity fell significantly. the obtained results allow to assume that the formed agent can be bacteriocin-like substance and the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) may be useful for food industry or probiotic construction.
