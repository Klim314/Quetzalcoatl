TI  - Targeted PCR for detection of vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Several novel bacterial species have been detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by using broad-range PCR assays, but this approach is insensitive for detecting minority species. We developed a series of taxon-directed 16S rRNA gene PCR assays for more sensitive detection of key vaginal bacteria. We sought to determine the prevalence of each species in the vagina, its association with BV, and the utility of PCR for the microbiological diagnosis of BV. Targeted PCR assays were developed for 17 vaginal bacterial species and applied to 264 vaginal-fluid samples from 81 subjects with and 183 subjects without BV. The results were compared to those of two widely accepted methods for diagnosing BV, the use of clinical findings (Amsel criteria) and the interpretation of vaginal-fluid Gram stains (Nugent criteria). Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Atopobium vaginae, an Eggerthella-like bacterium, Megasphaera species, and three novel bacteria in the order Clostridiales are among the bacterial species significantly associated with BV. PCR detection of either a Megasphaera species or one of the Clostridiales bacteria yielded a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 89% for diagnosis of BV compared to the Amsel clinical criteria and a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.7% compared to the Nugent criteria (Gram stain). PCR detection of one or more fastidious bacterial species is a more reliable indicator of BV than detection of bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, previously linked to BV, highlighting the potential of PCR for the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16S rRNA gene terminal RFLP fingerprinting.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. The vaginal microbiota in BV patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. In this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with BV and 20 healthy subjects. In the BV samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp., Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order Clostridiales. The number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). In contrast, in normal samples, only Lactobacillus species could be identified. In conclusion, T-RFLP provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of BV and healthy women. As such, T-RFLP may be helpful both in the diagnosis of BV from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of BV.
