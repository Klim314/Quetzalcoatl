TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == studies on water quality and pathogenic bacteria in coastal water langkawi, malaysia.
AB  == a study on physico-chemical parameters and pathogenic bacterial community was carried out at the coastal waters of pulau tuba island, langkawi. the physico-chemical parameters such as temperature (27.43-28.88 degrees c), dissolved oxygen (3.79-6.49 mg l(-1)), ph (7.72-8.20), salinity (33.10-33.96 ppt), total dissolved solids (32.27-32.77 g l(-1)) and specific conductivity (49.83-51.63 ms cm(-1)) were observed. station 3 and station 4 showed highest amount of nitrates (26.93 and 14.61 microg at n l(-1)) than station 1 (2.04 microg at n l(-1)) and station 2 (4.18 microg at n l(-1)). the highest concentration (12.4 +/- microg l(-1)) of chlorophyll a was observed in station 4  in october 2005. high phosphorus content (561 microg p l(-1)) was found in the station 2. thirteen bacterial isolates were successfully identified using api 20e system. the highest amount of bacteria was observed at station 4 (3400 cfu ml(-1)) and the lowest numberwas at station 2 (890 cfu ml(-1)). out of identified 13 gram-negative bacterial isolates dominant species were aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas baumannii, vibrio vulnificus, proteus mirabilis,  providencia alcalifaciens and serratia liquefaciens. apart from this, oil biodegrading pseudomonas putida were also identified. the study reveals the existing status of water quality is still conducive and the reasonably diverse with gram-negative bacteria along the pulau tuba langkawi.

TI  == crystal structures of lysine-preferred racemases, the non-antibiotic selectable markers for transgenic plants.
AB  == lysine racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent amino acid racemase that catalyzes the interconversion of lysine enantiomers, is valuable to serve as a novel non-antibiotic selectable marker in the generation of transgenic plants.  here, we have determined the first crystal structure of a lysine racemase (lyr) from proteus mirabilis bcrc10725, which shows the highest activity toward lysine  and weaker activity towards arginine. in addition, we establish the first broad-specificity amino acid racemase (bar) structure from pseudomonas putida dsm84, which presents not only the highest activity toward lysine but also remarkably broad substrate specificity. a complex structure of bar-lysine is also established here. these structures demonstrate the similar fold of alanine racemase, which is a head-to-tail homodimer with each protomer containing an n-terminal (alpha/beta)(8) barrel and a c-terminal beta-stranded domain. the active-site residues are located at the protomer interface that is a funnel-like  cavity with two catalytic bases, one from each protomer, and the plp binding site is at the bottom of this cavity. structural comparisons, site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, and modeling studies identify a conserved arginine and an adjacent conserved asparagine that fix the orientation of the plp o3 atom in both structures and assist in the enzyme activity. furthermore, side chains of two residues in alpha-helix 10 have been discovered to point toward the cavity and define the substrate specificity. our results provide a structural foundation for the design of racemases with pre-determined substrate specificity and for the development of the non-antibiotic selection system in transgenic plants.

TI  == class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in  southern china.
AB  == non-duplicate multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from january 2008 to december 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as  well as characterisation of gene cassettes. among 825 strains carrying the class  1 integrase gene inti1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and dna sequencing analyses. in addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in escherichia coli, six in klebsiella pneumoniae, six in enterobacter cloacae, three in enterobacter aerogenes, one in  proteus mirabilis, one in acinetobacter spp., one in stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in pseudomonas putida. among them, three cassettes, including had-like, deltamfs-1 and qnrvc-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.

TI  == activities of jatropha curcas phorbol esters in various bioassays.
AB  == jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality  biodiesel. however, jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (pes). in this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (peef) was used to evaluate the activity of pes using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (artemeia salina), daphnia (daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. in all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of pes increased mortality with an ec(50) (48 h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95 mg l(-1) pes for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. the sensitivity of various microorganisms for pes was also tested. among the bacterial species tested, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 215 mg l(-1) pes; and pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with mic of 251 mg l(-1) pes. similarly, fusarium species of fungi exhibited ec(50) of 58 mg l(-1) pes, while aspergillus niger and curvularia lunata had ec(50) of 70 mg l(-1). the snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1 mug of pes ml(-1). in conclusion, snail  bioassay could be used to monitor pes in jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. in addition, pes with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage t5.
AB  == although bacteriophage t5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. this is  the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage t5 lytic hydrolase. the endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage t5 was cloned in escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). the protein purified was shown to be an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase. the enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mm) at ph 8.5. the enzyme was strongly inhibited by edta and bapta, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. it was found that, along with e. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage t5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other gram-negative microorganisms (pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas putida, proteus vulgaris, and proteus mirabilis). this endolysin is the first example of  an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting gram-negative bacteria. there are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage t5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of  endolytic l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidases. the article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. hybrids secreting mabs specific for p. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from p. pseudomallei, p. cepacia, p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. alcaligenes, xanthomonas maltophilia, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, s. krefeld, s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. of the six specific clones, clone 5f8, which was igm-producing and which reacted with all 56 p. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. results obtained from the indirect elisa against various p. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5f8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. the antibody could be readily used to identify p. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. the antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect elisa that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.

AB  == the genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-pcd [ec 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a pseudomonas putida (formerly p. aeruginosa) (atcc 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed  using known amino acid sequences. a 1.5-kb smai fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading  frames, designated pcah and pcag, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-pcd. the amino acid sequences deduced from pcahg matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-pcd in all except three positions. cloning  of pcahg into broad-host-range expression vector pkmy319 allowed high levels of expression in p. putida strains, as well as in proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahg promoter with salicylate. the recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from p. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-pcd. the physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. these studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to  be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of p. putida 3,4-pcd, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.

TI  == novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in pseudomonas.
AB  == novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. we found that a new pseudomonas strain, pseudomonas flavida if-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pni10 and pni20. they were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pni10 and 2.9 kb for pni20. several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (kmr or smr) gene were constructed from pni10 and pni20. these plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid dna by the usual  competent cell method. the vectors derived from pni10 replicated not only in pseudomonas but also in some other gram-negative enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis.

AB  == the microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-o, dnase-b, hyaluronidase, streptozyme). giemsa smears and koh preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups a, b, c, d, f, g, s viridans, s pneumoniae; klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; escherichia coli; enterobacter cloacae, e aerogenes, e agglomerans; proteus mirabilis, p vulgaris; citrobacter freundii, c diversus; morganella morganii; pseudomonas aeruginosa, p maltiphilia, p putida; serratia marcescens; acinetobacter calbio aceticus, a luoffi; flavobacterium specie; cdc groups ve-1, ve-2, e-o2; bacillus subtilis, cereus; staphylococcus aureus; candida albicans, c parapsilosis; torulopsis, glabrata; rhodotorula and dermatophytes. one or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. titers to hepatitis e were elevated in one patient and to hiv in two patients.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [similar organization of beta,beta'-subunit rna-polymerase genes and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas putida].
AB  == the genes coding for the rna-polymerase beta,beta'-subunits and adjacent ribosomal protein genes in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas putida are compared by the southern hybridization procedure. in all the species studied close clustering of the genes rplkajl and rpobc is demonstrated. preliminary physical maps for these genes in s. typhimurium, s. flexneri, s. marcescens and p. mirabilis are proposed. rifampicin is shown to stimulate the beta,beta'-subunit synthesis in all the species studied, suggesting the existence of attenuators localized in front of the rpobc genes. the similar arrangement of  the genes rplkajlrpobc in a number of bacterial species is proposed to be due to  common mechanisms of their coordinate expression.

TI  == expression of the lactose transposon tn951 in escherichia coli, proteus and pseudomonas.
AB  == the control of beta-galactosidase specified by the lactose transposon tn951 (inserted into rp1 to give pgc9114) has been studied in escherichia coli k12, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida; in the first two species comparison could be made with flac. in e. coli k12, the tn951 and chromosomally encoded enzymes showed marked qualitative differences in regulatio, the former giving a substantially lower maximum induced level and induction ratio. several parameters were slightly affected by strain background. in p. mirabilis, beta-galactosidase control determined by both flac (in accord with earlier work) and pgc9114 was markedly different from e. coli in that maximal induced levels were about an order of magnitude lower and the induction ratio was reduced to 3 to 5. in ps. aeruginosa and ps. putida, tn951-specified lac expression was qualitatively similar to that in p. mirabilis. possible reasons for anomalous expression in proteus and pseudomonas are discussed.
