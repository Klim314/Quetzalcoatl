TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
