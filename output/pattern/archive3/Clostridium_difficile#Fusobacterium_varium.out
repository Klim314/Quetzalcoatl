antianaerobic activity of the ketolide ru 64004 compared to activities of four macrolides, five beta-lactams, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
agar dilution methodology (with added oxyrase in the case of the macrolide group  to allow incubation without added co2) was used to compare the activity of ru 64004, a new ketolide, with the activities of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin with and without clavulanate, piperacillin with and without tazobactam, metronidazole, and imipenem against 379 anaerobes. overall, ru 64004 yielded an mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (mic50) of 1.0 microg/ml and an mic90 of 16.0 microg/ml. in comparison, mic50s and mic90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 2.0 to 8.0 and >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. mics of macrolides, including ru 64004, were higher for bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium mortiferum, and clostridium difficile than for the other species. ru 64004 was more active against gram-positive rods and cocci, prevotella and porphyromonas spp., and fusobacteria other than f. mortiferum and f. varium than against the bacteroides fragilis group. overall mic50s and mic90s (in micrograms per milliliter), respectively, of other compounds were as follows: clindamycin, 1.0 and 16.0; amoxicillin, 4.0 and 64.0; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 0.5 and 4.0; piperacillin, 8.0 and >64.0; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.0 and 16.0; metronidazole, 1.0 and 4.0; and imipenem, 0.25 and 1.0.
