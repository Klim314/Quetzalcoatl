TI  - Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods: integration of both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods (GNR) by conventional phenotypic characteristics is a challenge for diagnostic microbiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of molecular methods, e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 158 clinical isolates covering 20 genera and 50 species isolated from 1993 to 2010 were analyzed by comparing biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis based identification. 16S rRNA gene homology analysis identified 148/158 (94%) of the isolates to species level, 9/158 (5%) to genus and 1/158 (1%) to family level. Compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing as reference method, phenotypic identification correctly identified 64/158 (40%) isolates to species level, mainly Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, and 21/158 (13%) isolates correctly to genus level, notably Capnocytophaga sp.; 73/158 (47%) of the isolates were not identified or misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: We herein propose an efficient strategy for accurate identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory by integrating both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We conclude that 16S rRNA gene sequencing is an effective means for identification of fastidious GNR, which are not readily identified by conventional phenotypic methods.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (IMP) were received at the Microbiology Testing Laboratory (MTL) of the University of Pennsylvania over a 2-year period. Paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by MTL from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (AP) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (RP). Patients' mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. Samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. Culture was used for detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, P. micros, Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium sp., enteric Gram-negative rods, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus sp., and yeast. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequently detected microorganisms from IMP were B. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), Fusobacterium (41%), P. micros (39%), and P. gingivalis (27%). Recovery levels (mean +/- SD) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. The most frequently detected organisms for AP were B. forsythus (83%), Fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), P. gingivalis (59%), P. micros (51%), and E. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. Corresponding data for RP were B. forsythus (85%), Fusobacterium (83%), P. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), C. rectus (56%), and P. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.
TI  - Growth differences of Capnocytophaga canimorsus strains and some other fastidious organisms on various Columbia-based blood agar media.
AB  - Three human isolates of Capnocytophaga canimorsus from blood cultures showed no growth when cultivated on sheep blood agar plates based on BBL Columbia agar base, whereas the same three strains grew excellently on sheep blood agar plates based on Difco Columbia agar bases No. 2 or EH. Two of the three strains also grew well on blood agar plates based on bioMerieux Columbia agar. Strains that grew better on either Difco or bioMerieux Columbia based blood agar plates were found among Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Kingella kingae, Lactobacillus sp., and Streptococcus adjacens, but these strains were never lost when cultivated on BBL Columbia agar plates. One strain of Lactobacillus failed to grow on Difco Columbia No. 2 agar and showed best growth on bioMerieux Columbia agar. Strains of Corynebacterium G 2, Corynebacterium afermentans and Streptococcus adjacens showed poor growth on chocolate agar when compared to blood agar media. Microbiologists should be aware of the importance of media formulations for optimal recovery of fastidious organisms.
TI  - Occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in Chile.
AB  - The occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP) patients. The subgingival proportion of the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. The results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%) there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, C. rectus, and F. nucleatum in LJP, and for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum in GJP. The mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (P < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. Capnocytophaga sp, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in LJP. When taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with LJP and GJP in Chile are P. gingivalis (66% of LJP and 80% of GJP affected sites), and A. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of LJP and 50% in GJP affected sites). Different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Dental bacterial plaques. Nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  - Antony van Leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. However, not until almost 200 years later was the famous Koch postulate introduced. Since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. In spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession of organisms. Lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. Among the commonly mentioned are: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as Eubacterium species. Anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. However, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. The general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis in adults. The definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  - In this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. During 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls 10 times. At the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI). A total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. Children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean PBI scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and Eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). The mean proportion of Actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). Among the species discriminated, only Capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of PBI (p less than = 0.05). The detection frequencies of black-pigmented Bacteroides (particularly B. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). These findings implicate Capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of Bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.
TI  - Microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. In the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. From 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. The proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented Bacteroides sp., B. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella sp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter sp., and Candida sp. Spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. Calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. The spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all individuals.
TI  - Humoral immune responses in experimental gingivitis in rats.
AB  - Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels to extracts of rat dental plaque and five oral bacteria (Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans Y-4, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Bact. intermedius ATCC 25261, Capnocytophaga sp. M-12, Eikenella corrodens ODU) were determined by ELISA. In addition, the presence of rat dental plaque and oral bacterial components in the inflamed gingival tissue was studied using immunofluorescence techniques. Serum and gingival tissue samples were obtained from ODU plaque-susceptible and plaque-resistant rats. In several susceptible rats, IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected. There was a correlation between the levels of IgG antibody to dental plaque and pocket probing depth, but not between pocket probing depth and the levels of IgM and IgA. Furthermore, components of rat dental plaque and oral bacteria were detected in the inflamed gingival tissue.
TI  - Immunoglobulin G response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  - Serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin G antibodies to antigens from Bacteroides gingivalis 381, Bacteroides intermedius 24, Bacteroides loescheii ATCC 15930, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Eikenella corrodens 1073, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, and Capnocytophaga sp. strain M-12. Immunoglobulin G antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibody levels to B. gingivalis in serum and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. Although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin G levels to B. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. The antibodies to F. nucleatum (P less than 0.05), E. corrodens (P less than 0.05), and A. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. There were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to B. intermedius, B. loescheii, and Capnocytophaga sp.
