TI  == oral administration of multispecies microbial supplements to sows influences the  composition of gut microbiota and fecal organic acids in their post-weaned piglets.
AB  == the timings of the administration of microbial supplements to control the populations of gut microbiota of piglets have been poorly understood. here the effects of temporal administering multispecies microbial supplements to sows on the composition of gut microbiota and on the bacteria-mediated fecal metabolites  in their offsprings were investigated. during gestation and lactation, pregnant sows were fed either a normal diet (group a) or a diet with multispecies supplements comprised of nine microbial species such as lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, candida pintolopesii, and aspergillus oryzae etc. (group b). all of the sows' piglets were temporarily fed with the same supplements around weaning in accordance with  the guideline of the farm. this regimen was followed by a normal diet in both groups over one month thereafter. under such conditions, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (scfas) in fecal samples remarkably increased in group b  compared to group a. when 16s rdna sequences of the fecal bacteria were analyzed, the microbial structure of bacteria was different between both goups. especially  the clostridium cluster iv and subcluster xiva were particularly increased in group b, although the administered microbes were undetectable. thus, temporal administration of multispecies-microbial supplements to pregnant sows changes the composition of scfas and gut microbiota in their offsprings.

TI  == use of gases to improve survival of bifidobacterium bifidum by modifying redox potential in fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the effect of the oxidoreduction potential, modified using gas, on the growth and survival of a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium bifidum, and 2 yogurt strains, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. three fermented milks were manufactured with an initial oxidoreduction potential value adjusted to +440 mv (control milk), +350 mv (milk gassed with n(2)), and -300 mv [milk gassed with n(2) plus 4% (vol/vol) h(2) (n(2)-h(2))]. acidification profiles, growth during milk fermentation and survival during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 d were determined. this study showed that fermented probiotic dairy products made from milk gassed with n(2) and, more particularly, those made from milk gassed with n(2)h(2) were characterized by a significant increase in b. bifidum survival during storage without affecting the fermentation kinetics and the survival of strep. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == modelling the survival of starter lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium bifidum in single and simultaneous cultures.
AB  == the inactivation kinetics at 4 degrees c of bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, cultured alone or consociated in a laboratory medium (modified mrs broth), were modelled through the weibull model and a second-order polynomial equation. the initial cell number of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was approximately 6-7log (cfu/ml); the viability loss after 30 days of storage was 2.87 and 1.99log (cfu/l) for l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, cultured alone, respectively; whereas the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with bifidobacteria reduced viability loss during storage (0.28 and  0.54log cfu/l for lactobacilli and streptococci, respectively). finally, the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with b. bifidum improved their oxygen uptake.

TI  == probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. design randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. setting: primary care. participants: children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. intervention: children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg; saccharomyces boulardii; bacillus clausii; mix of l delbrueckii var bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, l acidophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidum; or enterococcus faecium sf68. main outcome measures: primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. safety and tolerance were also recorded. results: 571 children were allocated to intervention. median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children  who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). one day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. the remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. conclusions: not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective  in children with acute diarrhoea. paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. trial registration number: current controlled trials isrctn56067537 [controlled-trials.com].

TI  == combined effect of different lactic acid bacteria strains on the mode of cytokines pattern expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the balance between immunogenic and tolerogenic activities in human immune system strongly depends on microflora-induced pro-and anti-inflammatory activities. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important components of microflora. the interactions of the different strains of lab and the cells of immune system are largely unknown. to assess if lab strains composition would have an effect on the cellular responses profile (proliferation, cytokines synthesis) peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (pbmc) model system was used. pbmc were induced by three different strains of lab: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum. tested strains were mixed together, in  combinations with each other (pairs) or alone. both, the lab mixture as well as the pairs and the single lab strains induced low lymphocyte proliferation (about  10% of cona-induced response). however, the single lab strains and their combinations were quite different cytokines inducers. first, l. acidophilus was much stronger ifn-gamma inducer than the lab mixture, being a few times higher il-12 stimulator than l. bulgaricus and b. bifidum. second, l. bulgaricus and b.  bifidum suppressed l.acidophilus-induced ifn-gamma synthesis to the level equal to that induced by the lab mixture, limiting il-12 production by about 30% and 70%, respectively. third, the lab strains were good il-10 and tnf-alpha inducers, irrespectively of their combinations used. we conclude that lab strains' pro or anti-inflammatory potentials are at least in part dependent on their composition. low lab mixture-induced il-12 and ifn-gamma production and relatively high il-10  and tnf-alpha expression may represent cellular activities normally induced in vivo by a combined action of bacterial antigens. their presence is important to limit pro-inflammatory reactions (via il-10) and to provide protection against infections (via tnf-alpha).

TI  == safety evaluation of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis uo 004, a probiotic  bacterium.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis uo 004 was evaluated for its use as a potential probiotic from a safety point of view. the strain did not exhibit mucinolytic or other enzymatic activities that might be detrimental, such as those involving glycosidases (beta-d-glucosaminidase or alpha-d-galactosidase) or arylamidases (factor xa and quimotrypsin-like activities), frequently present in  lactobacillus strains isolated from patients with endocarditis, although it was able to express protein ca and kallikrein-like activities. on the other hand, the presence of the strain did not interfere with the growth of certain species of normal intestinal microbiota, such as enterococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, bifidobacterium bifidum or bacteroides fragilis. moreover, the potential probiotic strain uo 004 is sensitive to antibiotics with transmissible resistance mechanisms in lactobacillus such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin. in addition, strain l. delbrueckii uo 004 was not able to translocate towards the intestinal barrier of mice or produce changes in their activity or general health status.

TI  == [growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  == growth features of industrial strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis mc-42, b. bifidum 1, b. longum b-379, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and l. plantarum 8pa3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (hmm and hsm respectively) were analysed comparatively. the bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. it was shown that hsm vs hmm provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. at the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == lowering of ochratoxin a level in milk by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == a decrease in the content of ochratoxin a (oa) was observed in milk samples fermented by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria. oa was added to the milk before fermentation at a rate of 0.05-1.5 mg/l. no residues of oa were found in samples  containing 0.05 and 0.1 mg/l of oa, fermented by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and b. bifidum. yoghurt bacteria (s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were the most effective since no residues were detected even in fermented samples containing originally 0.5 mg/l oa.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  == it was shown that cell extracts and cells of streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strain ta1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. cell extracts and cells of bifidobacterium bifidum and propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. no antimutagenic effect was found in escherichia coli ab1157, lactobacillus delbrueckii, or streptococcus thermophilus. antimutageneicity of the cell extract of str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. thiol compounds produced by growing str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. a relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a mm less than 12 kda are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
