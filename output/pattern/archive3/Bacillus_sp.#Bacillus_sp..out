isolation of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria from rhizospheric soil of halophytes and their impact on maize (zea mays l.) under induced soil salinity.
the present investigation was aimed to scrutinize the salt tolerance potential of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (pgpr) isolated from rhizospheric soil of selected halophytes (atriplex leucoclada, haloxylon salicornicum, lespedeza bicolor, suaeda fruticosa, and salicornica virginica) collected from high-saline fields (electrical conductivity 4.3-5.5) of district mardan, pakistan. five pgpr strains were identified using 16s rrna amplification and sequence analysis. bacillus sp., isolated from rhizospheric soil of atriplex leucoclada, and arthrobacter pascens, isolated from rhizospheric soil of suaeda fruticosa, are active phosphate solubilizers and bacteriocin and siderophore producers; hence, their inoculation and co-inoculation on maize ('rakaposhi') under induced salinity stress enhanced shoot and root length and shoot and root fresh and dry mass. the accumulation of osmolytes, including sugar and proline, and the elevation of antioxidant enzymes activity, including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, were enhanced in the maize variety when inoculated and co-inoculated with bacillus sp. and arthrobacter pascens. the pgpr (bacillus sp. and a. pascens) isolated from the rhizosphere of the mentioned halophytes species showed reliability in growth promotion of maize crop in all the physiological parameters; hence, they can be used as bio-inoculants for the plants growing under salt stress.
endophytic microbes bacillus sp. lzr216-regulated root development is dependent on polar auxin transport in arabidopsis seedlings.
key message: endophytic microbes bacillus sp. lzr216 isolated from arabidopsis root promoted arabidopsis seedlings growth. it may be achieved by promoting the lateral root growth and inhibiting the primary root elongation. plant roots are colonized by an immense number of microbes, including epiphytic and endophytic microbes. it was found that they have the ability to promote plant growth and protect roots from biotic and abiotic stresses. but little is known about the mechanism of the endophytic microbes-regulated root development. we isolated and identified a bacillus sp., named as lzr216, of endophytic bacteria from arabidopsis root. by employing a sterile experimental system, we found that lzr216 promoted the arabidopsis seedlings growth, which may be achieved by promoting the lateral root growth and inhibiting the primary root elongation. by testing the cell type-specific developmental markers, we demonstrated that bacillus sp. lzr216 increases the dr5::gus and dr5::gfp expression but decreases the cycb1;1::gus expression in arabidopsis root tips. further studies indicated that lzr216 is able to inhibit the meristematic length and decrease the cell division capability but has little effect on the quiescent center function of the root meristem. subsequently, it was also shown that lzr216 has no significant effects on the primary root length of the pin2 and aux1-7 mutants. furthermore, lzr216 down-regulates the levels of pin1-gfp, pin2-gfp, pin3-gfp, and aux1-yfp. in addition, the wild-type arabidopsis seedlings in the present of 1 or 5 microm npa (an auxin transport inhibitor) were insensitive to lzr216-inhibited primary root elongation. collectively, lzr216 regulates the development of root system architecture depending on polar auxin transport. this study shows a new insight on the ability of beneficial endophytic bacteria in regulating postembryonic root development.
antiproliferative, antifungal, and antibacterial activities of endophytic alternaria species from cupressaceae.
recent research has shown the bioprospecting of endophytic fungi from cupressaceae. here, we further uncover that the healthy cypress plants such as cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis host highly bioactive endophytic alternaria fungal species. indeed, endophytic alternaria alternata, alternaria pellucida, and alternaria tangelonis were recovered from healthy cupressaceous trees. biodiversity and bioactivity of recovered endophytic alternaria species were a matter of biogeography and host identity. we further extracted such alternaria's metabolites and highlighted their significant antiproliferative, growth inhibitory, and antibacterial activities against the model target fungus pyricularia oryzae and the model pathogenic bacteria bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora, and pseudomonas syringae. in vitro assays also indicated that endophytic alternaria species significantly inhibited the growth of cypress fungal phytopathogens diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi, and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, since the recovered alternaria species were originally reported as pathogenic and allergenic fungi, our findings suggest a possible ecological niche for them inside the foliar tissues of cupressaceous trees. moreover, in this study, the significant bioactivities of endophytic alternaria species in association with cupressaceae plant family are reported.
comparative pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial community change in biofilm formed on seawater reverse osmosis membrane.
the change in bacterial community structure induced by bacterial competition and  succession was investigated during seawater reverse osmosis (swro) in order to elucidate a possible link between the bacterial consortium on swro membranes and biofouling. to date, there has been no definitive characterization of the microbial diversity in swro in terms of distinguishing time-dependent changes in the richness or abundance of bacterial species. for bacterial succession within biofilms on the membrane surface, swro using a cross-flow filtration membrane test unit was operated for 5 and 100h, respectively. as results of the pyrosequencing analysis, bacterial communities differed considerably among seawater and the 5 and 100 h samples. from a total of 33,876 pyrosequences (using a 95% sequence similarity), there were less than 1% of shared species, confirming the influence of the operational time factor and lack of similarity of these communities. during swro operation, the abundance of pseudomonas stutzeri bbspn3 (gu594474) belonging to gamma-proteobacteria suggest that biofouling of swro membrane might be driven by the dominant influence of a specific species. in addition, among the bacterial competition of five bacterial species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus sp., rhodobacter sp., flavobacterium sp., and mycobacterium sp.) competing for bacterial colonization on the swro membrane surfaces, it was exhibited that bacillus sp. was the most dominant. the dominant influences ofpseudomonas sp. and bacillus sp. on biofouling during actual swro is decisive depending on higher removal efficiency of the seawater pretreatment.
study on effects of temperature, moisture and ph in degradation and degradation kinetics of aldrin, endosulfan, lindane pesticides during full-scale continuous rotary drum composting.
study focused on effects of temperature, moisture and ph on degradation and degradation kinetics of aldrin, endosulfan (alpha), endosulfan (beta) and lindane during vegetable waste composting using full-scale continuous rotary drum composter (fscrdc). extraction, concentration and quantification of pesticides were made from waste material at different stages by ultra-sonification, silica gel column and gc-ms analysis. removal efficiency of aldrin, endosulfan alpha, endosulfan beta and lindane was found 85.67%, 84.95%, 83.20% and 81.36% respectively due to optimum temperature, moisture, ph and enhanced microbial activity. maximum temperature in inlet zone was found 60-65 degrees c which is most suitable for complex microbial population. after feeding and turning in inlet zone, temperature reduced to 38 degrees c from 60 to 65 degrees c and regained it within 7-8h, and ph reduced to 5.3+/-0.2 from 7.5+/-0.3 in 4h and regained it in 10h. heterotrophic bacteria bacillus sp., pseudomonas sp. and lactobacillus sp. also decreased from 4.4x10(3) to 7.80x10(2)cfu g(-1) in 2 h due to gradual variation in temperature and ph. no significant temperature change was found in middle and outlet zones during feeding and turning. degradation of pesticides was observed as first order kinetics and half-life of aldrin, endosulfan alpha, endosulfan beta and lindane was reduced to 25.54, 18.43, 18.43 and 27.43 d from 1095, 60, 270 and 160 d respectively. thus, the observations in contrast of removal and degradation kinetics of organochlorine pesticides residues in vegetable waste though full-scale rotary drum composting proved it the best suited technique.
aquaculture and stress management: a review of probiotic intervention.
to meet the ever-increasing demand for animal protein, aquaculture continuously requires new techniques to increase the production yield. however, with every step towards intensification of aquaculture practices, there is an increase in stress level on the animal as well as on the environment. feeding practices in aqua farming usually plays an important role, and the addition of various additives to a balanced feed formula to achieve better growth is a common practice among the fish and shrimp culturists. probiotics, also known as 'bio-friendly agents', such as lab (lactobacillus), yeasts and bacillus sp., can be introduced into the culture environment to control and compete with pathogenic bacteria as well as to promote the growth of the cultured organisms. in addition, probiotics are non-pathogenic and non-toxic micro-organisms, having no undesirable side effects when administered to aquatic organisms. probiotics are also known to play an important role in developing innate immunity among the fishes, and hence help them to fight against any pathogenic bacterias as well as against environmental stressors. the present review is a brief but informative compilation of the different essential and desirable traits of probiotics, their mode of action and their useful effects on fishes. the review also highlights the role of probiotics in helping the fishes to combat against the different physical, chemical and biological stress.
characterization and antimicrobial activities of two streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of universiti putra malaysia.
this study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. the two isolates designated as b8 and c2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of universiti putra malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. their antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on mueller hinton and tryptic soy agar. in both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with b8 against all the test bacteria and c2 against five of them (bacillus sp., e. coli, pseudomonas sp., s. aureus and s. epidermidis). re-assessment against e. coli atcc 25922 and s. aureus atcc 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate b8 against both attc strains while c2 only against s. aureus atcc 25923. streptomyces griseus atcc 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both atcc strains. subsequently, the two isolates were identified by pcr/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16s rrna and rpob genes). characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculinec and 28 masculinec), on different microbiological media (aia, isp-2, mha, na, pda and tsa), were performed. more morphological features were observed on isp-2 for both isolates. a higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculinec in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate b8 outnumbered c2 at all experimental conditions. the observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.

bioassay-guided isolation of the etoac extract of a marine bacillus sp., cultured in modified bennett's broth medium, yielded four new antimicrobial fatty acids, named ieodomycins a-d. the planar structures of these new compounds were determined by extensive 1d and 2d nmr and hresims spectroscopic data analysis. their absolute configurations were elucidated by modified mosher's method and literature data review. all four new compounds demonstrated antimicrobial activities in vitro.
antimicrobial properties and phytochemical constituents of the leaves of african  mistletoe (tapinanthus dodoneifolius (dc) danser) (loranthaceae): an ethnomedicinal plant of hausaland, northern nigeria.
african mistletoe (tapinanthus dodoneifolius (dc) danser) called 'kauchi' in hausa is a hemi-plant parasite used ethnomedicinally by the hausa and the fulani tribes of northern nigeria as a remedy for several human and animal ailments that include stomach ache, diarrhoea, dysentery, wound and cancer. screening of the plant, obtained from 14 different hosts, revealed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities against certain multiple drug resistant bacterial and fungal isolates of farm animals. interestingly, the inhibition of the growth of agrobacterium tumefaciens, bacillus sp., escherichia coli, salmonella sp., proteus sp. and pseudomonas sp., bacterial sp. known to be associated with either crown gall or gastrointestinal tract and wound infections, by extracts of t. dodoneifolius gives credence to the ethnomedicinal usage of the plant. phytochemical screening showed the common occurrence of anthraquinones, saponins, and tannins, a rare presence of alkaloids and the absence of phlobatannins in the hemi-parasite. moreover, the antimicrobial activity and the presence or distribution of phytochemical substances in t. dodoneifolius appeared to be partly dependent on the host plant species.
mechanisms of increased linamarin degradation during solid-substrate fermentation of cassava.
several fungi and bacteria, isolated from ugandan domestic fermented cassava, released hcn from linamarin in defined growth media. in 72 h, a bacillus sp. decreased the linamarin to 1% of initial concentrations, mucor racemosus to 7%, rhizopus oryzae and r. stolonifer to 30%, but neurospora sitophila and geotrichum candidum hardly degraded the linamarin. adding pectolytic and cellulolytic enzymes, but not linamarase, to root pieces under aseptic conditions, led to root softening and significantly lower linamarin contents. neurospora sitophila showed no linamarase activity, in contrast to m. racemosus and bacillus sp., both of which were less effective in root softening and decreasing the root linamarin content. the most important contribution of microorganisms to linamarin decrease in the solid-substrate fermentation of cassava is their cell-wall-degrading activity, which enhances the contact between endogenous linamarase and linamarin.
cell density and non-equilibrium sorption effects on bacterial dispersal in groundwater microcosms.
the relative importance of dispersion, physical straining, non-equilibrium sorption, and cell density on the dispersal of bacteria was examined in saturated, flow-dynamic sand columns. the bacterial breakthrough as a result of different size distributions of sand particles was followed by measuring the effluent concentration of 3h-adenosine-labelled cells of a bacillus sp. and an enterobacter sp. strain suspended in groundwater. the breakthrough curves were compared with theoretical curves predicted from an advective-dispersioe equilibrium sorption model (ads), an ads model with a first order sink term for irreversible cell reactions, a two-site model (equilibrium and nonequilibrium sorption sites), and a filtration model. bacterial sand: water isotherms were linear in the experimental concentration range but had positive intercepts. the partition coefficients ranged from 15 to 0.4 for the bacillus sp., and 120 to 0.4 for a pseudomonas sp., and decreased with increasing particle size of the dominant fraction. in a kinetic study, the partition coefficient for the enterobacter sp. in the smaller particle sand was 63 after one hour, but had decreased to 9 after 19 hours. bacteria were detected in the effluent after one pore volume, which was earlier than predicted by the sand : water partition coefficients, and displayed an apparent nonequilibrium breakthrough. dispersion effects and physical straining appeared to be insignificant in the experiments, but tailing of the elution part of the curves indicated slow reversible sorption, and nonequilibrium sorption may have been the main determinant of dispersal retardation. the reversible non-equilibrium sorption invalidated some of the assumptions behind all models except, possibly, the two-site model. consequently, the models described the large particle sand data better where sorption was of less importance for the dispersal. the dispersal retardation was also affected by the bacterial cell density, both in the pore water and on the sand, suggesting that population characteristics may be an important factor for the bacterial distribution between the water and sand habitats. the retardation factor decreased from 13.7 to 7.8 when the cell density in the loading solution was increased from 3x 10(8) to 1.2 x 10(9) cells ml(-1). presaturation of the sand with bacteria had a similar effect.
the site of inhibition of cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose in staphylococcus aureus.
the inhibition of growth and cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose (3-ag), which is known to be one of the constituents of the kanamycin molecule and a metabolite of bacillus sp., was almost completely overcome by glucosamine and n-acetylglucosamine in staphylococcus aureus but scarcely affected by d-glucose and d-fructose. the antibiotic did not inhibit the incorporation of [14c]glucosamine and [3h]n-acetylglucosamine into the acid-insoluble fraction, but rather enhanced the incorporation of [14c]glucosamine. on the other hand, it inhibited the incorporation of d-[14c]fructose into the cell wall fraction but hardly affected the incorporation of d-[14c]fructose into the acid-insoluble fraction in the presence of pencillin g. based on these results, it is suggested that the site of primary action of 3-ag is the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate from d-fructose-6-phosphate, which is catalyzed by glucosamine synthetase [ec 2.6.1.16].
studies on bacterial cell wall inhibitors. iii. 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose, an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis.
it was shown that 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose, one of the constituents of the kanamycin molecule and a metabolite of bacillus sp., inhibits the bacterial synthesis of cell wall. the antibiotic (100 microgram/ml) significantly inhibits the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda 209p as well as the incorporation of dl-[14c]alanine into the acid-insoluble macromolecular fraction of its growing cells in the presence of chloramphenicol (100 microgram/ml). in contrast, the antibiotic does not affect the incorporation of [3h]thymidine, [3h]uridine and l-[14c]leucine. the other constituents of kanamycin, 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-glucose and deoxystreptamine do not inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.
