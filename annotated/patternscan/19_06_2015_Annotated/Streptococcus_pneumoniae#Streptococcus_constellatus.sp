TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == [clinical efficacy of oral clarithromycin monotherapy in patients with mild or moderate community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  == clarithromycin (cam) is a new macrolide antibiotic which is active against a wide range of organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and has superior pharmacokinetics and tolerance compared to erythromycin. in this study,  we evaluated the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity of cam in the empirical treatment of patients with cap. cam (200 mg given twice daily for 2 weeks) was orally administered to 26 patients with mild or moderate suspected atypical pneumonia, including 15 patients in whom treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was largely ineffective. causative pathogens were identified on the basis of quantitative sputum cultures, blood cultures, and routine serological testings; m. pneumoniae was most commonly observed in patients with cap (38.5%; 10/26), followed by h. influenzae (11.5%; 3/26), c. pneumoniae (3.8%; 1/26), and  s. constellatus (3.8%; 1/26). penicillin-resistant, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 1 patient (3.8%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively out of 26 patients with cap. there were no detectable pathogens in 8 of 26 patients. the treatment of cam resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia in all the patients and was not accompanied with any adverse events. the overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was not detectable in the patients evaluated. although it is important to make differential diagnosis of atypical from bacterial pneumonia in  designing therapeutic strategy, it is often difficult to make an appropriate diagnosis in patients with cap. because of diagnostic difficulties, cam with a broad antimicrobial spectrum is recommended as the first-line drug for the treatment of lower respiratory infections, particularly in patients with suspected atypical pneumonia.

TI  == cloning and expression of hyaluronate lyase genes of streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus(1).
AB  == hyaluronate lyase (haase) genes of streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus were isolated. in s. constellatus subsp. constellatus, the deduced amino acid sequence of haase was most similar to that of s. intermedius (68%), whereas the enzyme of s. intermedius was most similar to that of s. pneumoniae (72%). upstream of the haase gene on the opposite strands,  an open reading frame of a putative glutathione peroxidase started in s. intermedius, and this arrangement was similar to that in s. pneumoniae but unlike that in s. constellatus subsp. constellatus. cell lysates of escherichia coli carrying each streptococcal gene showed haase activity, demonstrating that each cloned gene actually coded for haase.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  == we reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (abm) caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with abm). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14  cases (serotype a: 4, b: 5, c: 1, g: 4) and were predominant among patients with  endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (s. mitis: 4, s. constellatus: 2, e. faecalis: 2, s. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.

TI  == in vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the pare-parc region in s. mitis.
AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == [eight cases of infection caused by the streptococcus milleri group--significance of serum antibody titer and a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infections caused by streptococcus milleri and streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == eight cases of infection caused by streptococcus milleri were studied clinically, and a comparative study was made of the backgrounds and factors influencing the development of infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri and streptococcus pneumoniae. the patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. the infectious diseases encountered  among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. an underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. six serum antibody titers for the s. milleri groups were examined in the first department of internal medicine, university of the ryukyus. three cases for s. anginosus, two cases for s. intermedius, and one case for s. constellatus showed high titers of x1024 or x2048. therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the s. milleri group. we also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by s. milleri and s. pneumoniae. there are more underlying diseases in infections caused by s. milleri than in those caused by s. pneumoniae. there were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by  s. milleri than among those with s. pneumonia infections.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group d streptococci.
AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus-constellatus infections of the nervous system.
AB  == two patients are presented with central nervous system infections due to an uncommon type of viridans streptococci, s anginosus-constellatus. of the various  streptococci, s pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent in meningitis, but  many species, including those which are facultative anaerobes or microaerophiles, have been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, subdural empyema, and abscesses involving the brain and epidural space.
