TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == cloning and biochemical characterization of fox-5, an ampc-type plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase from a new york city klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae 5064, isolated in new york, carried plasmid-mediated resistance to multiple beta-lactams and was unresponsive to clavulanic acid. the  beta-lactamase gene responsible for cephalosporin resistance encoded fox-5, with  96 to 97% amino acid identities to other members of the fox family of beta-lactamases. the bla(fox-5) coding region was located next to a transposase gene from the aeromonas salmonicida insertion element isas2.

TI  == a general method to generate dna probes for microorganisms.
AB  == we present a method that permits the rapid generation of dna probes for eubacteria. in the procedure the variable regions for the 16s rrna genes are amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology and primers based on the conserved regions of these genes. following sequencing of the variable regions, a choice is possible for a probe specific for that organism. no knowledge of the molecular biology of the microorganism is required prior to the  application of this approach. the generality of the method is shown using salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas fluorescens, aeromonas salmonicida and mycobacterium bovis. a. salmonicida was examined in detail and a dna probe was prepared that distinguishes it from other aeromonas species.
