TI  - The fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora requires the rpoN gene for pathogenicity in apple.
AB  - RpoN is a sigma(54) factor regulating essential virulence gene expression in several plant pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas syringae and Pectobacterium carotovorum. In this study, we found that mutation of rpoN in the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora caused a nonpathogenic phenotype. The E. amylovora rpoN Tn5 transposon mutant rpoN1250::Tn5 did not cause fire blight disease symptoms on shoots of mature apple trees. In detached immature apple fruits, the rpoN1250::Tn5 mutant failed to cause fire blight disease symptoms and grew to population levels 12 orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type. In addition, the rpoN1250::Tn5 mutant failed to elicit a hypersensitive response when infiltrated into nonhost tobacco plant leaves, and rpoN1250::Tn5 cells failed to express HrpN protein when grown in hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity)-inducing liquid medium. A plasmid-borne copy of the wild-type rpoN gene complemented all the rpoN1250::Tn5 mutant phenotypes tested. The rpoN1250::Tn5 mutant was prototrophic on minimal solid and liquid media, indicating that the rpoN1250::Tn5 nonpathogenic phenotype was not caused by a defect in basic metabolism or growth. This study provides clear genetic evidence that rpoN is an essential virulence gene of E. amylovora, suggesting that rpoN has the same function in E. amylovora as in P. syringae and Pe. carotovorum.
TI  - Top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  - Many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. However, to our knowledge, no such list exists. The aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal Molecular Plant Pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a 'Top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. The survey generated 458 votes from the international community, and allowed the construction of a Top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. The list includes, in rank order: (1) Pseudomonas syringae pathovars; (2) Ralstonia solanacearum; (3) Agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) Xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) Erwinia amylovora; (8) Xylella fastidiosa; (9) Dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) Pectobacterium carotovorum (and Pectobacterium atrosepticum). Bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the Top 10 include Clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), Pseudomonas savastanoi and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. This review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the Top 10 list and its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. It will be interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the Top 10.
TI  - [Study of hrpN(CSDS001) and the gene expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana induced by Harpin(CSDS001)].
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora CSDS001 elicits hypersensitive reaction (HR) in tobacco. From the genomic libraries of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora CSDS001, the hrpNCSDS001 gene (GenBank number AY939927), was isolated. The hrpNCSDS001 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli, and was used to induce HR by injecting into tobacco. We further examined the global regulation of Arabidopsis thaliana genes in response to HarpinCSDS001 at a concentration of 30 miccrog/mL. We indicated that 912, 1787, 2393, 1833 and 1,755 genes that were regulated significantly (log ratio <or=-1 or >or=1) at 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h respectively after the treatment. Analysis of some transcription factors (TF) showed that 13 TF families responded to HarpinCSDS001 including ZIM, BES1, TCP, C2C2, AP2/EREBP, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, GARP, MYB, NAC, HB, C2H2. These families mainly function in biological processes of plant defense, pho-tosynthesisdevelopment and flowering.
TI  - Expression of the hypersensitive response-assisting protein in Arabidopsis results in harpin-dependent hypersensitive cell death in response to Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - Active defense mechanisms of plants against pathogens often include a rapid plant cell death known as the hypersensitive cell death (HCD). Hypersensitive response-assisting protein (HRAP) isolated from sweet pepper intensifies the harpin(Pss)-mediated HCD. Here we demonstrate that constitutive expression of the hrap gene in Arabidopsis results in an enhanced disease resistance towards soft rot pathogen, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. This resistance was due to the induction of HCD since different HCD markers viz. Athsr3, Athsr4, ion leakage, H(2)O(2) and protein kinase were induced. One of the elicitor harpin proteins, HrpN, from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora was able to induce a stronger HCD in hrap-Arabidopsis than non-transgenic controls. To elucidate the role of HrpN, we used E. carotovora subsp. carotovora defective in HrpN production. The hrpN(-) mutant did not induce disease resistance or HCD markers in hrap-Arabidopsis. These results imply that the disease resistance of hrap-Arabidopsis against a virulent pathogen is harpin dependent.
TI  - Use of a pooled transposon mutation grid to demonstrate roles in disease development for Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica putative type III secreted effector (DspE/A) and helper (HrpN) proteins.
AB  - Soft rot Erwinia spp., like other closely related plant pathogens, possess a type III secretion system (TTSS) (encoded by the hrp gene cluster) implicated in disease development. We report the sequence of the entire hrp gene cluster and adjacent dsp genes in Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1039. The cluster is similar in content and structural organization to that in E. amylovora. However, eight putative genes of unknown function located within the E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica cluster do not have homologues in the E. amylovora cluster. An arrayed set of Tn5 insertional mutants (mutation grid) was constructed and pooled to allow rapid isolation of mutants for any given gene by polymerase chain reaction screening. This novel approach was used to obtain mutations in two structural genes (hrcC and hrcV), the effector gene dspE/A, and the helper gene hrpN. An improved pathogenicity assay revealed that these mutations led to significantly reduced virulence, showing that both the putative E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica TTSS-delivered effector and helper proteins are required for potato infection.
TI  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and Erwinia-derived elicitors HrpN and PehA  trigger distinct but interacting defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis.
AB  - We have used an hrp-positive strain of the soft rot pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora to elucidate plant responses to this bacterial necrotroph. Purified virulence determinants, harpin (HrpN) and polygalacturonase (PehA), were used as tools to facilitate this analysis. We show that HrpN elicits lesion formation in Arabidopsis and tobacco and triggers systemic resistance in Arabidopsis. Establishment of resistance is accompanied by the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent, but also jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET)-dependent, marker genes PR1 and PDF1.2, respectively, suggesting that both SA-dependent and JA/ET-dependent defense pathways are activated. Use of pathway-specific mutants and transgenic NahG plants show that both pathways are required for the induction of resistance. Arabidopsis plants treated simultaneously with both elictors PehA, known to trigger only JA/ET-dependent defense signaling, and HrpN react with accelerated and enhanced induction of the marker genes PR1 and PDF1.2 both locally and systemically. This mutual amplification of defense gene expression involves both SA-dependent and JA/ET-dependent defense signaling. The two elicitors produced by E. carotovora subsp. carotovora also cooperate in triggering increased production of superoxide and lesion formation.
TI  - [Type III secretion system in Se9R can recognize and secret harpin in Erwinia amylovora].
AB  - Bacterial pathogens of both animals and plants use type III secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. The signal that leads to tye type III secretion is encoded as stem loop structure in the messenger RNA. Harpin, produced by Erwinia anylovora is secreted via type III secretion. Erwinia carotovora Se9R and Erwinia amylovora belong to the same genus and they use type III secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. We used PCR to amplify hrpN from pCPP430 which harbors hrpN gene cluster, and cloned it to pGEM-T vector to get pWGF1, which was then chemically transformed into DH5 alpha (pCPP430hrpN-) and electrotransformed into Se9R. DH5 alpha (pCPP430hrpN-/pWGF1) induced hypersensitive response on tomato leaf and Se9R(pWGF1) showed significantly reduced virulence than Se9R on Chinese cabbage leaf. Western-blotting analysis of the CFEP of Se9R(pWGF1) showed production of harpin protein. These results suggest the type III secretion machine in Se9R can recognize secretion singal in the gene of harpin in Erwinia amylovora and secret it as a biologically native form.
TI  - Sample sequencing of a selected region of the genome of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica reveals candidate phytopathogenicity genes and allows comparison with Escherichia coli.
AB  - Genome sequencing is making a profound impact on microbiology. Currently, however, only one plant pathogen genome sequence is publicly available and no genome-sequencing project has been initiated for any species of the genus Erwinia, which includes several important plant pathogens. This paper describes a targeted sample sequencing approach to study the genome of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca), a major soft-rot pathogen of potato. A large insert DNA (approx. 115 kb) library of Eca was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector. Hybridization and end-sequence data revealed two overlapping BAC clones that span an entire hrp gene cluster. Random subcloning and one-fold sequence coverage (>200 kb) across these BACs identified 25 (89%) of 28 hrp genes predicted from the orthologous hrp cluster of Erwinia amylovora. Regions flanking the hrp cluster contained orthologues of known or putative pathogenicity operons from other Erwinia species, including dspEF (E. amylovora), hecAB and pecSM (E. chrysanthemi), sequences similar to genes from the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, including haemagglutinin-like genes, and sequences similar to genes involved in rhizobacterium-plant interactions. Approximately 10% of the sequences showed strongest nucleotide similarities to genes in the closely related model bacterium and animal pathogen Escherichia coli. However, the positions of some of these genes were different in the two genomes. Approximately 30% of sequences showed no significant similarity to any database entries. A physical map was made across the genomic region spanning the hrp cluster by hybridization to the BAC library and to digested BAC clones, and by PCR between sequence contigs. A multiple genome coverage BAC library and one-fold sample sequencing are an effective combination for extracting useful information from important regions of the Eca genome, providing a wealth of candidate novel pathogenicity genes for functional analyses. Other genomic regions could be similarly targeted.
TI  - Diversity of polyamine patterns in soft rot pathogens and other plant-associated  members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Polyamine profiles of 91 pectolytic and other plant-associated strains from 30 taxa of the Enterobacteriaceae were obtained by gradient high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pectobacterium carotovorum, basonym Erwinia carotovora, contained a high amount of putrescine and less diaminopropane. Diaminopropane was absent in Pectobacterium chrysanthemi, basonym E. chrysanthemi, whereas cadaverine was present in addition to the major compound putrescine. This chemotaxonomic difference reflects the deepest phylogenetic branching point within the recently emended genus Pectobacterium which lies between the two species P. carotovorum and P. chrysanthemi. Both important soft rot pathogens are easily distinguishable from each other and from the type species of the genus Erwinia as diaminopropane is the only major polyamine compound in E. amylovora. Chemotaxonomic heterogeneity is also emerging with respect to DYE's Amylovora group proposed in an early phytopathological concept.
TI  - Effects of the two-component system comprising GacA and GacS of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmB RNA, extracellular enzymes, and harpinEcc.
AB  - Posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (RSM) RsmA-rsmB pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes and HarpinEcc in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. RsmA is a small RNA-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mRNA species. rsmB specifies an untranslated regulatory RNA and neutralizes the RsmA effect. It has been speculated that GacA-GacS, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via RsmA. Because expA, a gacA homolog, and expS (or rpfA), a gacS homolog, have been identified in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gacA and gacS homologs on the expression of rsmA, rsmB, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. The gacA gene of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celV, a cellulase gene), hrpNEcc (an E. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmB in GacA+ and GacS+ E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. Similarly, the E. carotovora subsp. carotovora gacA gene stimulated csrB (rsmB) transcription in Escherichia coli. A GacS- mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain AH2 and a GacA- mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain Ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsmA RNA and RsmA protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (Hex) hexA, kdgR (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmC, and rpoS (gene for Sigma-S, an alternate Sigma factor). The levels of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and HarpinEcc proteins were stimulated in GacS- and GacA- mutants by GacS+ or GacA+ plasmids, respectively. The GacA effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpNEcc was abrogated in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in RsmA and RsmC or RsmA, RsmC, and rsmB RNA. The expression of lacZ transcriptional fusions of rsmB of Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a GacA- and a GacS- mutant of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gacA and gacS homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting Erwinia spp. and several nonsoft-rotting Erwinia species such as E. amylovora, E. rhapontici, E. herbicola, E. stewartii, and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. These findings establish that the GacA-GacS system controls transcription of rsmB of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. amylovora, and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated, at least in part, via the levels of rsmB transcripts.
TI  - hexA of Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain Ecc71 negatively regulates production of RpoS and rsmB RNA, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone.
AB  - The soft-rotting bacterium, Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (E. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (Pel), polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase (Cel) and protease (Prt), as well as HarpinEcc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (HR). The production of these exoenzymes and HarpinEcc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone; OHL] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexA of E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71 (hereafter hexA71), like that of another E. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, OHL and virulence in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71. In addition to exoenzymes, HexA71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpNEcc, the structural gene for HarpinEcc. Exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by OHL deficiency in a HexA- and Ohll- double mutant, indicating that HexA and OHL are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. HexA71 negatively affects RpoS, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the HexA- mutant than in the HexA+ strain. However, a HexA- and RpoS double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celVgenes than the HexA- and RpoS+ parent. Thus, the elevated levels of RpoS protein in the HexA- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. The following evidence associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the HexA mutant to overproduction of rsmB RNA, a global regulator of exoenzymes, HarpinEcc, OHL and secondary metabolites. Analyses of rsmB transcripts and expression of an rsmB-lacZoperon fusion in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71 revealed that HexA71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmB. Multiple copies of hexA71+ DNA suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV and hrpNEcc transcripts. Multiple copies of rsmB+ DNA, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexA+. The occurrence of hexA homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexA71 DNA on rsmB transcripts were also detected in other E. c. carotovora strains as well as Erwinia carotovora atroseptica and Erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. Extrapolating from the findings with LrhA, the Escherichia coli homologue of HexA, and the presence of sprE homologues in E. carotovora subspecies, we propose that HexA71 controls several regulatory pathways in E. carotovora including rsmB transcription and the production of SprEEcc which, in turn, affects RpoS levels. A model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting Erwinia carotovora subspecies.
TI  - rsmC of the soft-rotting bacterium Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora negatively controls extracellular enzyme and harpin(Ecc) production and virulence by modulating levels of regulatory RNA (rsmB) and RNA-binding protein (RsmA).
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the production of extracellular enzymes (pectate lyase [Pel], polygalacturonase [Peh], cellulase [Cel], and protease [Prt]) and harpin(Ecc) (the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction) in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is regulated by RsmA, an RNA-binding protein, and rsmB, a regulatory RNA (Rsm stands for regulator of secondary metabolites) (Y. Liu et al., Mol. Microbiol. 29:219-234, 1998). We have cloned and characterized a novel regulatory gene, rsmC, that activates RsmA production and represses extracellular enzyme and harpin(Ecc) production, rsmB transcription, and virulence in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. In an rsmC knockout mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora Ecc71 carrying the chromosomal copy of the wild-type rsmA(+) allele, the basal levels of Pel, Peh, Cel, Prt, and harpin(Ecc) as well as the amounts of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpN(Ecc) transcripts are high, whereas the levels of rsmA transcripts and RsmA protein are low. Furthermore, the expression of an rsmA-lacZ gene fusion is lower in the RsmC(-) mutant than in the RsmC(+) parent. Conversely, the expression of an rsmB-lacZ operon fusion is higher in the RsmC(-) mutant than in the RsmC(+) parent. These observations establish that RsmC negatively regulates rsmB transcription but positively affects RsmA production. Indeed, comparative studies with an RsmC(-) mutant, an RsmA(-) mutant, and an RsmA(-) RsmC(-) double mutant have revealed that the negative effects on exoprotein production and virulence are due to the cumulative regulatory effects of RsmC on rsmA and rsmB. Exoprotein production by the RsmC(-) mutant is partially dependent on the quorum sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone. Southern blot data and analysis of PCR products disclosed the presence of rsmC sequences in E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, and E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. These findings collectively support the idea that rsmA and rsmB expression in these plant pathogenic Erwinia species is controlled by RsmC or a functional homolog of RsmC.
TI  - kdgREcc negatively regulates genes for pectinases, cellulase, protease, HarpinEcc, and a global RNA regulator in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (Pel),  polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase (Cel), and protease (Prt). The concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. E. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces HarpinEcc, the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction. We document here that KdgREcc (Kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; KdgR, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the E. chrysanthemi repressor, KdgREch and the Escherichia coli repressor, KdgREco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, Pel and Peh, but also Cel, Prt, and HarpinEcc production in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. The levels of pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts are markedly affected by KdgREcc. The KdgREcc- mutant is more virulent than the KdgREcc+ parent. Thus, our data for the first time establish a global regulatory role for KdgREcc in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. Another novel observation is the negative effect of KdgREcc on the transcription of rsmB (previously aepH), which specifies an RNA regulator controlling exoenzyme and HarpinEcc production. The levels of rsmB RNA are higher in the KdgREcc- mutant than in the KdgREcc+ parent. Moreover, by DNase I protection assays we determined that purified KdgREcc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmB. Alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus sequence of the KdgREcc-binding site as 5'-G/AA/TA/TGAAA[N6]TTTCAG/TG/TA-3'. Two such KdgREcc-binding sites occur in rsmB DNA in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third KdgREcc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. Analysis of lacZ transcriptional fusions shows that the KdgR-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmB. KdgREcc also binds the operator DNAs of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacZ and a peh1-lacZ transcriptional fusions. We conclude that KdgREcc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global RNA regulator. Our findings support the idea that KdgREcc affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.
TI  - Phylogenetic position of phytopathogens within the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The almost complete 16S rDNA sequences of twenty nine plant-associated strains, representing species of the genera Erwinia, Pantoea and Enterobacter were determined and compared with those of other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The species of the genus Erwinia may be divided into three phylogenetic groups. Cluster I represents the true erwinias and comprises E. amylovora, E. mallotivora, E. persicinus, E. psidii, E. rhapontici and E. tracheiphila. We propose to unite the species of cluster II, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. carotovora subsp. odorifera, E. carotovora subsp. wasabiae, E. cacticida, E. chrysanthemi and E. cypripedii in the genus Pectobacterium respectively as P. carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum comb. nov., P. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum comb. nov., P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum comb. nov., P. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum comb. nov., P. carotovorum subsp. wasabiae comb. nov., P. cacticidum comb. nov., P. chrysanthemi and P. cypripedii. The species E. alni, E. nigrifluens, E. paradisiaca, E. quercina, E. rubrifaciens and E. salicis, comprising cluster III, are being classified into a new genus Brenneria gen. nov. respectively as B. alni comb. nov., B. nigrifluens comb. nov., B. paradisiaca comb. nov., B. quercina comb. nov., B. rubrifaciens comb. nov. and B. salicis comb. nov. The species of the genus Pantoea, included in this study, form a monophyletic unit (cluster IV), closely related with Erwinia, whereas the three phytopathogenic species of the genus Enterobacter are scattered among the genera Citrobacter and Klebsiella.
TI  - Characterization of a novel RNA regulator of Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  - The enterobacterium Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter Ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (Pels), cellulase (Cel), polygalacturonase (Peh) and protease (Prt). These enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. Ecc71 also produces HarpinEcc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (HR) and the quorum-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHL). OHL controls extracellular enzyme and HarpinEcc production. The levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpNEcc, the structural gene for HarpinEcc, and ohll, the gene specifying OHL synthesis, are negatively regulated by RsmaA. rsmB, formerly aepH, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6His-RsmA recombinant protein purified from E. coli binds rsmB RNA as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmB comprises 547 bp DNA, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. In Ecc71, two rsmB RNA species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmB RNA and a 259 base rsmB' RNA. rsmB' DNA hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. A 3' RNase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base RNA species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. The expression of rsmB-lacZ transcriptional fusions established that the rsmB' RNA is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. These data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmB' RNA is derived by processing of the primary rsmB RNA. In Ecc71, rsmB' expression driven by the lac promoter causes overproduction of Pel, Peh, Cel and Prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpNEcc and ohll transcripts. By contrast, a plasmid with the rsmB' DNA sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the extracellular enzymes in Ecc71. The rsmB' effect also occurs in Escherichia coli as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmB'. In vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmB' have established that rsmB' RNA does not yield a translational product. Therefore, we concluded that the rsmB' RNA itself functions as the regulator. Indeed, the expression rsmB' DNA leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the RNA-binding protein, RsmA, in Ecc71 and Serratia marcescens strain SM274. We propose a model that explains how RsmA and rsmB control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.
TI  - RpoS (sigma-S) controls expression of rsmA, a global regulator of secondary metabolites, harpin, and extracellular proteins in Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - RpoS (sigma-S or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. We document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic Erwinia species, such as E. amylovora; E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum, and carotovora; E. chrysanthemi; E. herbicola; E. rhapontici; and E. stewartii, possess rpoS genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. We show that rpoS transcription in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter which resides within the nlpD gene located upstream of rpoS as in E. coli. RpoS- E. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain AC5061, constructed by marker exchange, is more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic pH than its RpoS+ parent strain, AC5006. The basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpN (hrpNEcc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the RpoS- strain than in the RpoS+ parent. Likewise, compared to AC5006, AC5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. Our findings with the RpoS- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpoS+ DNA reveal that rpoS positively controls rsmA expression. We also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the RpoS effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpNEcc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsmA expression.
TI  - The RsmA- mutants of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain Ecc71 overexpress hrpNEcc and elicit a hypersensitive reaction-like response in tobacco leaves.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora wild-type strain Ecc71 does not elicit the hypersensitive reaction (HR) in tobacco leaves. By mini-Tn5-Km and chemical mutagenesis we have isolated RsmA- mutants of Ecc71 that produce high basal levels of pectate lyases, polygalacturonase, cellulase, and protease; they also are hypervirulent. The RsmA- mutants, but not their parent strains, elicit an HR-like response in tobacco leaves. This reaction is characterized by the rapid appearance of water soaking followed by tissue collapse and necrosis. The affected areas remain limited to the region infiltrated with bacterial cells, and the symptoms closely resemble a typical HR, e.g., the reactions caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi. Moreover, low concentrations of cells of the mini-Tn5-Km insertion RsmA- mutant, AC5070, infiltrated into tobacco leaf tissue prevent elicitation of the rapid necrosis by AC5070 or by P. syringae pv. pisi. Elicitation of the HR-like response by the mutants is not affected by the deficiency of N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, the cell density (quorum) sensing signal. Cloning and sequence analysis have disclosed that E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain Ecc71 possesses a homolog of E. chrysanthemi hrpN known to encode an elicitor of the HR; the corresponding Ecc71 gene is designated hrpNEcc. Northern (RNA) blot data show that the level of hrpNEcc mRNA is considerably higher in the RsmA- mutants than in the RsmA+ strains. Moreover, a low copy plasmid carrying the rsmA+ allele severely reduces the level of the hrpNEcc transcripts in the RsmA- mutants. These constructs, like the RsmA+ E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains, do not elicit the HR-like response. These data taken along with the effects of rsmA on exoenzyme production and pathogenicity (A. Chatterjee et al., 1995, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:1959-1967) demonstrate that this global regulator gene plays a critical role in plant interaction of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora.
TI  - Global regulation in Erwinia species by Erwinia carotovora rsmA, a homologue of Escherichia coli csrA: repression of secondary metabolites, pathogenicity and hypersensitive reaction.
AB  - Our previous studies revealed that rsmA of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 suppressed the synthesis of the cell density (quorum) sensing signal N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, the production of extracellular enzymes and tissue macerating ability in soft-rotting Erwinia species and that homologues of this negative regulator gene were present in other Erwinia species. Northern blot data presented here demonstrate that rsmA and rsmA-like genes are also expressed in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting Erwinia spp. such as E. amylovora, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. herbicola and E. stewartii. A low-copy plasmid carrying rsmA of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 caused suppression of antibiotic production in E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, flagellum formation in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, carotenoid production in E. herbicola and E. stewartii, and indigoidine production in E. chrysanthemi. In E. amylovora, rsmA of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora suppressed the elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves and the production of disease symptoms in apple shoots, in addition to repressing motility and extracellular polysaccharide production. We conclude that rsmA homologues function as global regulators of secondary metabolic pathways as well as factors controlling host interaction of Erwinia species.
