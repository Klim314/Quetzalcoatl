TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == anti-tumour immune effect of oral administration of lactobacillus plantarum to ct26 tumour-bearing mice.
AB  == colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer that shows a high mortality and increasing incidence. there are numerous successful treatment  options for crc, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy; however, their side effects and limitations are considerable. probiotics may be an effective strategy for preventing and inhibiting tumour growth through stimulation of host innate and adaptive immunity. we investigated and compared potential anti-tumour immune responses induced by two isolated lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus plantarum a and lactobacillus rhamnosus b, by pre-inoculating mice with lactobacilli for 14 days. subsequently, subcutaneous and orthotopic intestinal tumours were generated in the pre-inoculated mice using ct26 murine adenocarcinoma cells and were assessed for response against the tumour. our results indicated that oral administration with l. plantarum inhibited ct26 cell growth in balb/c mice and prolonged the survival time of tumour-bearing mice compared with mice administered l. rhamnosus. l. plantarum produced protective immunity against the challenge with ct26 cells by increasing  the effector functions of cd8+ and natural killer (nk) cell infiltration into tumour tissue, up-regulation of ifn-gamma (but not il-4 or il-17) production, and promotion of th1-type cd4+ t differentiation. consequently, our results suggest that l. plantarum can enhance the anti-tumour immune response and delay tumour formation.

TI  == the use of pfge method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. in recent years,  interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly  increased. in order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. pulse-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. the following study describes a way of performing pfge analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus lactobacillus: l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == cyclooxygenase as a target in chemoprevention by probiotics during 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induced colon carcinogenesis in rats.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to assess the effects of potential probiotics in regulating the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) along with other morphological and histological analysis during 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) induced colon carcinogenesis in rats. the rats were divided into 6 groups viz., normal control, lactobacillus plantarum (adf10) treated, lactobacillus rhamnosus  gg (lgg) treated, dmh treated, adf10 + dmh treated and lgg + dmh treated. probiotics were supplemented to rats at dose levels of 2 x 10(10) cells per day for 6 days in a week. all the treatments were continued for a period of 16 wk. dmh treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in the levels of total sialic acid (tsa). however, on supplementation with probiotics, a significant reduction in tsa was observed. dmh treatment brought about a significant increase in the expression of cox-2. but, supplementation of probiotics brought down the protein expression to moderate level. further, supplementation with probiotics was also able to reduce tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity and average tumor size. therefore, treatment with probiotics has the potential of providing protection against colon cancer by suppressing the cox-2 expression as one of the protective mechanisms.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == microbial population, chemical composition and silage fermentation of cassava residues.
AB  == in order to effectively use the cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) residues, including cassava leaves, peel and pulp for livestock diets, the chemical and microbiological composition, silage preparation and the effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants on silage fermentation of cassava residues were studied. these residues contained 104 to 105 lab and yeasts, 103 to 104 coliform  bacteria and 104 aerobic bacteria in colony forming units (cfu) on a fresh matter (fm) basis. the molds were consistently at or below the detectable level (102 cfu of fm) in three kinds of cassava residues. dry matter (dm), crude protein (cp) and neutral detergent fiber (ndf) content of cassava residues were 17.50-30.95%,  1.30-16.41% and 25.40-52.90% on a dm basis, respectively. the silage treatments were designed as control silage without additive (co) or with lab inoculants chikuso-1 (ch, lactobacillus plantarum) and snow lacto (sn, lactobacillus rhamnosus) at a rate of 5 mg/kg of fm basis. all silages were well preserved with a low ph (below 4.0) value and when cassava residues silage treated with inoculants ch and sn improved fermentation quality with a lower ph, butyric acid  and higher lactic acid than control silage.

TI  == evaluation of the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains and their in vitro effect.
AB  == probiotic ingestion is recommended as a preventive approach to maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiota and to enhance the human well-being. during  the whole life of each individual, the gut microbiota composition could be altered by lifestyle, diet, antibiotic therapies and other stress conditions, which may lead to acute and chronic disorders. hence, probiotics can be administered for the prevention or treatment of some disorders, including lactose malabsorption, acute diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and mild forms of inflammatory bowel disease. the probiotic-mediated effect is an important issue that needs to be addressed in relation to strain-specific probiotic properties. in this work, the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were screened, and their effects in vitro were evaluated. they were screened for probiotic properties by determining their tolerance to low ph and to bile salts, antibiotic sensitivity, antimicrobial activity and vitamin b8, b9 and b12 production, and by considering their ability to increase the antioxidant potential and to modulate the inflammatory status of systemic-miming cell lines in vitro. three out of the  examined strains presenting the most performant probiotic properties, as lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus rhamnosus pbs070 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis pbso75, were evaluated for their effects also on human intestinal ht-29 cell line. the obtained results support the possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the oral administration of these probiotical strains to patients with acute and chronic gut disorders, by in vivo experiments.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus plantarum a7 with probiotic potential on colon cancer and normal cells proliferation in comparison with a commercial strain.
AB  == objectives: several beneficial effects have been attributed to the probiotic lactic acid bacteria. it was determined that lactobacilli can exert antiproliferative effects on the various cancer cell lines including colon cancer. effects of lactic acid bacteria on colon cancer may vary from strain to strain and there is a need to find the new probiotic strains with tumor suppressing properties through in vitro studies. materials and methods: anti-proliferative activities of heat-killed cells and cell-free supernatants of  a native strain of lactobacillus plantarum a7 and a commercial strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were assessed on human colon cancer cell lines (caco-2 and ht-29) and normal cells (l-929), using mtt assay. cells were seeded at 2x10(4) cells/mlin 96 well plates and incubated for 24 hr. then heat-killed cells (od620: 0.025, 0.0.05, 0.1) and cell-free supernatants of bacteria were added at  concentration of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml. after 48 hr incubation mtt (5 mg/ml) was added and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using elisa plate reader. results: results showed that heat-killed cells and cell-free supernatants of both probiotic strains reduced the growth rate of cancer and normal cells. these results suggested that anti-proliferative effect may not be an exclusive characteris ticwhich is dedicated to officially approved probiotics. conclusion:  l. plantarum a7 could be considered as colon cancer biological product, most likely due to its advantages in significant organic acid production.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus la68 and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 differently influence metabolic and immunological parameters in high fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis.
AB  == in this study, two lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus la68 and l. plantarum wcfs1) were evaluated for their effects on high fat diet induced pathology in mice. the aim was to determine whether the administration of lactic acid bacteria had beneficial effects on ameliorating pathology. c57bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet were orally administered with the lactobacillus strains. both the metabolic  and immunological parameters were analyzed. the administration of both of the strains had beneficial effects on mouse weight, serum cholesterol, tnf-alpha levels and liver histology. la68 lowered the total cholesterol and hdl levels more prominently, whereas wcfs1 was more potent in lowering the tg and ldl levels. leptin and adiponectin levels were increased in all experimental groups to different extents. the administration of l. plantarum wcfs1 led to a marked increase in leptin levels, as well as an increase in cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ cells, and a decrease of cd25+ cells, and had a lowering effect on il-6 production and cell metabolic activity. in conclusion, active administration of both lactobacillus strains had a positive effect on hfd-induced pathology. although both of the tested strains had beneficial effects, oral administration of wcfs1 increased leptin levels and had a more prominent immunomodulatory effect, which should be taken into consideration in case of humane usage.

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == differential immune-stimulatory effects of ltas from different lactic acid bacteria via mapk signaling pathway in raw 264.7 cells.
AB  == objective: lipoteichoic acid (lta) is an immune-stimulatory component found in the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria, which are a major group of gram-positive bacteria known to have beneficial health effects in humans. in this study, we evaluated the stimulatory effects of ltas isolated from different lactobacilli species with mouse macrophage raw 264.7 cells. methods: raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with plta (isolated from lactobacillus plantarum k8), rlta (isolated from lactobacillus rhamnosus), dlta (isolated from lactobacillus delbreukii), and slta (isolated from lactobacillus sakei k101). tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha  and interleukin (il)-10 production were examined by elisa, and nitric oxide (no)  production was assayed using griess reaction. the mrna and protein expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and western blotting. signaling  molecules were also examined by western blotting. results: plta and rlta moderately induced tnf-alpha, il-10, and no production compared with stimulation  of raw 264.7 cells with dlta and slta. similar results were obtained for the mrna and protein expression levels of inos. western blot analysis showed that treatment of cells with plta or rlta resulted in minimal phosphorylation of erk,  jnk and p38 mapk while, dlta and slta were strong activators of mapk signaling. in addition, the glycolipid structure of ltas was found to be composed of different fatty acid chain groups and lengths. taken together, these results suggest that the differential immuno-stimulatory effects of ltas isolated from different lactobacillus species may be related to their different ability to activate the mapk signaling pathway, which are modulated by a unique glycolipid structure of lta.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == efficacy of corn silage inoculants on the fermentation quality under farm conditions and their influence on aspergillus parasitucus, a. flavus and a. fumigatus determined by q-pcr.
AB  == laboratory-scale silos were prepared to evaluate the efficacy of two different lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the fermentation quality and mycobiota of corn silage. their influence on aspergillus species' variability by using the q-pcr technique was studied. silage inoculated with lactobacillus rhamnosus rc007 or l. plantarum rc009 were compared with uninoculated silage. silos were opened after 1, 7, 45, 90 and 120 days after ensiling. at the end of the ensiling period, silos were left open for 7 days to evaluate aerobic stability. rapid lactic acid  production and decline in ph values were seen in the early stages of fermentation in silage inoculated with l. rhamnosus rc007. after aerobic exposure, a significant decline in lactic acid content was observed in untreated and l. plantarum rc009-inoculated silages. counts for yeasted and toxigenic fungus remained lower, after aerobic exposure, in l. rhamnosus rc007-inoculated silage,  in comparison with l. plantarum rc009 and uninoculated silages. comparing the influence exerted by both bal, it was observed that l. rhamnosus rc007 was more efficient at inhibiting the three fungal species tested whose dna concentrations, determined by q-pcr, oscillated near the initial value (pre-ensiling maize). the  ability of l. rhamnosus rc007 to produce lactic acid rapidly and the decline in ph values in the early stages of the fermentation along with the reduction of yeast and mycotoxicogenic fungus after aerobic exposure shows its potential as a  bio-control inoculant agent in animal feed.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == immunomodulation of monocytes by probiotic and selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, are recognized as common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and have received considerable attention in the last decades due to their postulated health-promoting effects. lab and probiotic bacteria can modulate the  host immune response. however, much is unknown about the mediators and mechanisms responsible for their immunological effect. here, we present a study using cytokine secretion from the monocytic cell line thp-1 and nf-kappab activation in the monocytic cell line u937-3xkb-luc to elucidate immune stimulating abilities of lab in vitro. in this study, we investigate both commercially available and potential probiotic lab strains, and the role of putative surface proteins of l.  reuteri using mutants. l. reuteri strains induced the highest cytokine secretion  and the highest nf-kappab activation, whereas l. plantarum strains and l. rhamnosus gg were low inducers/activators. one of the putative l. reuteri surface proteins, hmpref0536_10802, appeared to be of importance for the stimulation of thp-1 cells and the activation of nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells. live and uv-inactivated preparations resulted in different responses for two of the strains investigated. our results add to the complexity in the interaction between lab and human cells and suggest the possible involvement of secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of lab. it is likely that it is the sum of bacterial surface proteins and bacterial metabolites and/or secreted proteins that induce cytokine secretion in thp-1 cells and activate nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells in this study.

AB  == background: butyric acid, one of the key products formed when beta-glucans are degraded by the microbiota in the colon, has been proposed to be important for colonic health. glutamine bound to the fibre may have similar effects once it has been liberated from the fibre in the colon. both beta-glucans and glutamine are found in high amounts in malted barley. lactobacillus rhamnosus together with malt has been shown to increase the formation of butyric acid further in rats. objective: to investigate whether lactobacillus rhamnosus 271, lactobacillus paracasei 87002, lactobacillus plantarum heal 9 and 19, and bifidobacterium infantis cure 21 affect the levels of short-chain fatty acids and glutamine in caecum and portal blood of rats fed barley malt. design: the experimental diets were fed for 12 days. the daily dose of the probiotic strain was 1x10(9) colony forming units and the intake of fibre 0.82 g/day. results: the malt mostly contained insoluble fibre polymers (93%), consisting of glucose and xylose (38-41 g/kg) and some arabinose (21 g/kg). the fibre polysaccharides were quite resistant to fermentation in the rats, regardless of whether or not probiotics were added (25-30% were fermented). caecal and portal levels of acetic acid decreased in the rats after the addition of l. plantarum heal 9 and l. rhamnosus  271, and also the levels of butyric acid. viable counts of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterobacteriaceae were unaffected, while the caecal composition of lactobacilli was influenced by the type of strain administrated. portal levels of glutamine were unchanged, but glycine levels increased with l. plantarum heal 9 and 19 and phenylalanine with l. rhamnosus 271. conclusions: although the probiotic strains survived and reached the caecum, except b. infantis cure 21, there were no effects on viable counts or in the fermentation of different fibre components, but the formation of some bacterial metabolites decreased. this may be due to the high proportion of insoluble fibres in the malt.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == eruca sativa might influence the growth, survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and some biological features of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  == the growth and viability of three lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, after their passage through simulated gastric and pancreatic juices were studied as a function of their presence in the growth medium of rocket salad (eruca sativa). the presence of e. sativa affected some of the biological properties of the strains. for example, l. acidophilus and l. plantarum worked more efficiently in  the presence of e. sativa, increasing not only the antioxidant activity of the medium, but also their own antioxidant power and antimicrobial activity; l. rhamnosus was not affected in the same manner. overall, the presence of vegetables might help to boost, in specific cases, some of the characteristics of lactobacilli, including antioxidant and antimicrobial power.

TI  == a new risk factor for neonatal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation: bacterial probiotics.
AB  == abstract objective: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) colonisation can be controlled with strict adherence to infection control measures. we describe a vre outbreak coincident with bacterial probiotic trial. relationship between probiotic and vre colonisation, and other possible risk factors were investigated. methods: two hundred and ten infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks had been randomised for a trial with probiotic preparation containing lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium lactis, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, colostrums and lactoferrin (nbl probiotic atp(r); nobel, istanbul, turkey) between february  2012 and august 2013 when a vre outbreak also took place. the existence of a relationship between this probiotic preparation and vre colonisation was investigated. results: the begining and end of the outbreak were coincident with  the beginning and end of the probiotic trial. demographic and clinical features of neonates did not differ between vre colonised (n = 94) and non-colonised infants (n = 116) except for vancomycin (p = 0.012) and probiotic (p < 0.001) use. conclusions: probiotic and vancomycin exposure were significant risk factors for vre colonisation. the acquisition and transfer of resistance genes of bacteria may be mediated by probiotics. therefore, the safety of probiotics is a  concern and should be investigated further.

TI  == distinct immunomodulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell responses to lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 by two different polysaccharides isolated from lactobacillus rhamnosus lock 0900.
AB  == the structures of polysaccharides (ps) isolated from lactobacillus rhamnosus lock 0900 and results from stimulation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bm-dc) and human embryonal kidney (hek293) cells stably transfected with toll-like receptors (tlr) upon exposure to these antigens were studied. l. rhamnosus lock 0900 produces ps that differ greatly in their structure. the polymer l900/2, with a high average molecular mass of 830 kda, is a branched heteropolysaccharide with a unique repeating unit consisting of seven sugar residues and pyruvic acid, whereas l900/3 has a low average molecular mass of 18  kda and contains a pentasaccharide repeating unit and phosphorus. furthermore, we found that both described ps neither induce cytokine production and maturation of mouse bm-dc nor induce signaling through tlr2/tlr4 receptors. however, they differ profoundly in their abilities to modulate the bm-dc immune response to the well-characterized human isolate lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1. exposure to l900/2 enhanced interleukin-10 (il-10) production induced by l. plantarum wcfs1,  while in contrast, l900/3 enhanced the production of il-12p70. we conclude that ps, probably due to their chemical features, are able to modulate the immune responses to third-party antigens. the ability to induce regulatory il-10 by l900/2 opens up the possibility to use this ps in therapy of inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, whereas l900/3 might be useful in reverting the antigen-dependent th2-skewed immune responses in allergies.

TI  == mucosal siv vaccines comprising inactivated virus particles and bacterial adjuvants induce cd8(+) t-regulatory cells that suppress siv-positive cd4(+) t-cell activation and prevent siv infection in the macaque model.
AB  == a new paradigm of mucosal vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)  infection has been investigated in the macaque model. a vaccine consisting of inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)mac239 particles together with a living bacterial adjuvant (either the calmette and guerin bacillus, lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus rhamnosus) was administered to macaques via the vaginal or oral/intragastric route. in contrast to all established human and veterinary vaccines, these three vaccine regimens did not elicit siv-specific antibodies nor cytotoxic t-lymphocytes but induced a previously unrecognized population of non-cytolytic mhcib/e-restricted cd8(+) t-regulatory cells that suppressed the activation of siv-positive cd4(+) t-lymphocytes. siv reverse transcription was thereby blocked in inactivated cd4(+) t-cells; the initial burst of virus replication was prevented and the vaccinated macaques were protected from a challenge infection. for 3-14 months after intragastric immunization, 24 macaques were challenged intrarectally with a high dose of sivmac239 or with the heterologous strain siv b670 (both strains grown on macaques pbmc). twenty-three of these animals were found to be protected for up to 48 months while all 24 control macaques became infected. this protective effect against siv challenge together with the concomitant identification of a robust ex vivo correlate of protection suggests a new approach for developing an  hiv vaccine in humans. the induction of this new class of cd8(+) t-regulatory cells could also possibly be used therapeutically for suppressing hiv replication in infected patients and this novel tolerogenic vaccine paradigm may have potential applications for treating a wide range of immune disorders and is likely to may have profound implications across immunology generally.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == efficacy of probiotic therapy on atopic dermatitis in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate a therapeutic efficacy of probiotics mixture (probiotics) in the treatment of children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (ad). methods:  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial with a washout period of 2 weeks and an intervention period for 6 weeks, conducted from november 2010 to october 2011. one hundred children with mild to moderate ad (2-9 years old) were randomly allocated to the probiotics (lactobacilluss casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium lactis) or  placebo groups. the assessment of efficacy was based on the change in eczema area severity index (easi), visual analogue scale for pruritus (vasp), fecal cell counts of each strains (log10[cell counts/g stool]), and serum cytokine levels (interleukin-4 [il-4]; il-10; tumor necrosis factor alpha, [tnf-alpha]) in weeks  0 and 6. results: demographics and baseline characteristics at the week 0 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. the significant increments in fecal-cell counts were observed in the probiotcs group at week 6 (p=0.00), while  the cytokine levels between the 2 groups were not significantly different in week 6 (il-4, p=0.50; il-10, p=0.58; tnf-alpha, p=0.82). the probiotics significantly  improved clinical severity after 6 weeks' intervention of probiotics; however, the placebo group also showed significant improvement (easi; p=0.00, vasp; p=0.00). conclusions: our findings showed that probiotics successfully colonized  in the intestine after 6 weeks' intervention; nevertheless, we could not find an  additional therapeutic or immunomodulatory effects on the treatment of ad. further long-term studies will be necessary to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

TI  == probiotic screening and safety evaluation of lactobacillus strains from plants, artisanal goat cheese, human stools, and breast milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to select autochthonous strains of lactobacillus from stools of healthy infants and adults, human milk, artisanal goat cheese, and fruits and vegetables according to their probiotic properties and safety. from 421 strains of lactobacillus isolated, 102 (24.2%) were shown to be tolerant to gastric ph and bile salts; they were used to determine their anti-helicobacter pylori (agar diffusion assay), antioxidant (oxygen radical absorption capacity),  and anti-inflammatory (inhibition of interleukin-8 release by tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated ht-29 cells) activities as well as their ability to adhere to intestinal (caco-2) and gastric (ags) epithelial cells. results obtained were compared with three commercial probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. johnsonii ncc533. the five strains most efficient according to these activities were subsequently identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene, their susceptibility to antibiotics was determined, and their safety evaluated in mice. one strain of l. plantarum was discarded due to the higher prevalence of liver bacterial translocation observed in the animals fed this strain. in conclusion, four autochthonous strains of l. rhamnosus were finally selected with probiotic properties and safety allowing their eventual use in human studies. these results contribute to increase the diversity of probiotic strains available for the development of nutraceuticals and functional foods.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of gastric-derived lactobacillus plantarum xb7 in the context of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric epithelium induces interleukin-8 (il-8) production and inflammation leading to host cell damage. we  searched for gastric-derived lactobacillus with the ability to suppress h. pylori-induced inflammation. materials and methods: conditioned media from gastric-derived lactobacillus spp. were tested for the ability to suppress h. pylori-induced il-8 production in ags gastric epithelial cells. il-8 protein and  mrna levels were measured by elisa and qpcr, respectively. the changes on host cell signaling pathway were analyzed by western blotting and the anti-inflammatory effect was tested in a sprague-dawley rat model. results: conditioned media from l. salivarius b101, l. rhamnosus b103, and l. plantarum xb7 suppressed il-8 production and il-8 mrna expression in h. pylori-induced ags  cells without inhibiting h. pylori growth. conditioned media from ls-b101, lr-b103, and lp-xb7 suppressed the activation of nf-kappab in ags cells, while strain lp-xb7 also suppressed c-jun activation. the anti-inflammatory effect of lp-xb7 was further assessed in vivo using a h. pylori-infected sprague-dawley rat model. strain lp-xb7 contributed to a delay in the detection and colonization of  h. pylori in rat stomachs, attenuated gastric inflammation, and ameliorated gastric histopathology. additionally, the administration of lp-xb7 correlated with the suppression of tnf-alpha and cinc-1 in sera, and suppression of cinc-1 in the gastric mucosa of h. pylori-infected rats. conclusions: these results suggest that l. plantarum xb7 produces secreted factors capable of modulating inflammation during h. pylori infection, and this probiotic lactobacillus strain  shows promise as an adjunctive therapy for treating h. pylori-associated disease.

TI  == immunostimulatory cpg motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  == toll-like receptor (tlr) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cpg motifs in bacterial dna, and tlr9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of cpg motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. the frequency of potentially immunostimulatory cpg motifs (all cpg hexamers) or purine-purine-cg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic g+c content. we found that species belonging to proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of gtcgtt, the optimal motif stimulating human tlr9. we also found that enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of gtcgtt motifs. as gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of cpg motifs, the overall load of cpg motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. the optimal cpg motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of tlr9 signalling. we speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with cpg motif-rich dna could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the t-helper  1 (th1)/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. in autoimmune disorders, cpg motif-rich dna could, however, further increase the th1-type immune responsiveness. estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns,  including cpg motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

AB  == low-fat caciotta-type cheeses were manufactured with partially skim milk (fat content of ~0.3%) alone (lfc); with the supplementation of 0.5% (wt/vol) microparticulated whey protein concentrate (mwpc) (lfc-mwpc); with mwpc and exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st446 (lfc-mwpc-eps); and with mwpc, eps-producing strain st446, and lactobacillus plantarum lp and lactobacillus rhamnosus lra as adjunct cultures (lfc-mwpc-eps-a). the non-eps-producing isogenic variant streptococcus thermophilus st042 was used for making full-fat caciotta-type cheese (ffc), lfc,  and lfc-mwpc. cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. compared with ffc and lfc (51.6 +/- 0.7 to 53.0 +/- 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 +/- 1.1 to 67.5 +/- 0.5%). the mwpc mainly contributed to moisture retention. overall, all lfc had approximately one-fourth (22.6 +/- 0.8%) of the fat of ffc. hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. microbial eps positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of lfc without mwpc or microbial eps was excessively firm. free amino acids were at the highest levels in lfc treatments (2,705.8 +/-  122 to 3,070.4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of mwpc and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated lfc variants and ffc. the  sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described lfc-mwpc-eps and lfc-mwpc-eps-a. based on the technology options used, low-fat caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened  for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == anti-hiv-1 activity, protease inhibition and safety profile of extracts prepared  from rhus parviflora.
AB  == background: in the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of rhus parviflora roxb. (anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-hiv activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. methods: aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-hiv property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease activity. safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. results: both aqueous (ic50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (ic50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of r. parviflora showed anti-hiv activity in tzm-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in hiv infected cem-gfp cells and human pbls. the anti-hiv activity is mediated through inhibition of hiv-1 protease activity. both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells. the extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. the extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (vk2/e6e7). levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. conclusions: the studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-hiv activity and preliminary safety profile  of the extracts prepared from the leaves of r. parviflora.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == utilization of lactic acid bacterial genes in synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 in the production of lactic acid.
AB  == metabolic pathway engineering of cyanobacteria for the production of industrially important chemicals from atmospheric co2 has generated interest recently. here, we engineered synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 to produce lactic acid using a lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene from various lactic acid-producing bacteria, lactococcus lactis (ldhb and ldhx), lactobacillus plantarum (ldhl and ldh), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (ldhl). the lactic acid was secreted outside the cell using a transporter (lldp) gene from l. plantarum. expression of each ldh in synechocystis sp. pcc6803 was ascertained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. five transformants led to the production of l-lactic acid. co-expression of lldp with ldhb from l. plantarum or ldhl from l. rhamnosus led to the secretion of lactic acid into the medium at concentration of 0.17 +/- 0.02 or 0.14 +/- 0.02 mm after 18 d of cultivation.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

TI  == differential effect on cell-mediated immunity in human volunteers after intake of different lactobacilli.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms which have beneficial effects on the host when ingested in adequate amounts. probiotic bacteria may stimulate immune effector functions in a strain-specific manner. in this blind placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effects on the immune system following daily intake of six different strains of lactobacilli or the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas lundensis for 2 or 5 weeks. blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorter and the expression of activation and memory markers was determined. the bacterial strains were also examined for their capacity to adhere to human intestinal cells and to be phagocytosed by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. intake of lactobacillus plantarum strain 299v increased the expression of the activation marker cd25 (p = 0.01) on cd8(+) t cells and the memory cell marker cd45ro on cd4(+) t cells (p = 0.03), whereas intake of l. paracasei tended to expand the natural killer t (nk t) cell population (p = 0.06). the phagocytic activity of granulocytes was increased following intake of l. plantarum 299v, l. plantarum heal, l. paracasei or l. fermentum. in contrast, ingestion of l. rhamnosus decreased the expression of cd25 and cd45ro significantly within the cd4(+) cell population. the observed immune effects after in-vivo administration of the probiotic bacteria could not be predicted by either their adherence capacity or the in-vitro-induced cytokine  production. the stimulation of cd8(+) t cells and nk t cells suggests that intake of probiotic bacteria may enhance the immune defence against, e.g. viral infections or tumours.

AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

AB  == two consecutive studies were conducted to evaluate the dietary supplementation of citrus by-products (cb) fermented with probiotic bacteria on growth performance,  feed utilization, innate immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile olive flounder. in experiment i, five diets were formulated to contain 0% (control) or 3% four different cb fermented with bacillus subtilis (bs), enterococcus faecium (ef), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) and l. plantarum (lp) (designated as con, cbf-bs, cbf-ef, cbf-lr and cbf-lp, respectively). during 10 weeks of a feeding trial, growth performance and feed efficiency were not significantly different among all the fish groups. however, fish fed cbf containing diets had significantly higher survivals than the con group. disease resistance of fish against edwardsiella tarda was increased by the fermentation of cb. in experiment ii, we chose the bs as a promising probiotic and formulated  five diets to contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% cbf-bs. growth performance was not significantly affected by the cbf-bs supplementation during 6 weeks of a feeding  trial. innate immunity of fish was significantly enhanced by cbf-bs supplementation. myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities were increased in a dose-dependent manner by dietary cbf-bs inclusions. in a consecutive challenge test against e. tarda, an increased disease resistance was found by cbf-bs supplementation. these studies indicate that the fermentation process of cb with  probiotic has beneficial effects on innate immunity and thereby increases disease resistance of olive flounder against e. tarda. bacillus subtilis can be used as a promising probiotic microbe for by-product fermentation in fish feeds.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  == the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to  be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 lactobacillus plantarum, 37 lb. pentosus, 1 lb. paraplantarum, and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. lb. rhamnosus gg and lb. casei shirota were used as reference strains. the in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7), caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. three (3)  lb. pentosus, 4 lb. plantarum and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low ph. the majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 lb. plantarum and 7 lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. none of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. variable efficiency to adhere to caco-2 cells was observed. this was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. none of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. as a whole,  4 strains of lb. pentosus, 3 strains of lb. plantarum and 2 strains of lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains lb. casei shirota and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.

TI  == characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolates and their inoculating effects on the silage fermentation at high temperature.
AB  == thermotolerant strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were screened for their suitability for silage making at high temperatures. four selected strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing analyses and added to unwilted and wilted italian ryegrass for ensiling at 45 degrees c. all four strains (ht1, ht2, ht3 and ht4) grew at 50 degrees c and ph 4.0. strains ht1 and ht2 were identified as  lactobacillus rhamnosus; ht3 and ht4 were identified as lact. fermentum. strains  ht1 and ht2 were the most effective at improving the fermentation quality of italian ryegrass silage, irrespective of wilting, as indicated by lower ph values, less nh(3) -n, and more lactic acid. in contrast, strains ht3, ht4 and a  commercial inoculant consisting of lact. plantarum and pediococcus acidilactici conferred no or reduced benefits. wilting alone did not improve the fermentation  quality of italian ryegrass at 45 degrees c. inoculating with thermotolerant lact. rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 could improve the fermentation quality of silage at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants  for silage making in the tropics and subtropics and could play an important role  in developing silage production in such regions. significance and impact of the study: grasses are often difficult to ensile in the tropics and subtropics because of the high temperatures there. to solve this problem, we screened for thermotolerant lactic acid bacteria and obtained two valuable strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, ht1 and ht2, which proved to be beneficial to silage fermentation at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants for silage making in the tropics and subtropics, and will play an important role in developing silage production in such regions.

TI  == is a multispecies probiotic mixture effective in constipation during pregnancy? 'a pilot study'.
AB  == background: constipation during pregnancy is a common problem. nowadays only few  effective interventions are published preventing or treating constipation during  pregnancy. however, their use is limited due to side-effects. this uncontrolled intervention study was performed to determine if a mixture of probiotics in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy is effective. methods: women aged >/=  18 years with functional constipation were included at the obstetrical outpatient clinic and midwife practices. patients received during four weeks a daily dose of ecologic(r)relief (bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, bifidobacterium longum w108, lactobacillus casei w79, lactobacillus plantarum w62 and lactobacillus rhamnosus w71 (total 4*10(9) cfu)). for all analyses, the non-parametric paired wilcoxon test was used. primary outcome measure was change  in defecation frequency. secondary outcome measures were stool consistency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation, abdominal pain, adverse effects, presence of reflux episodes and intake of bisacodyl. results: 20 women were included. defecation frequency significantly increased from 3.1 at baseline to 6.7 in week  four (p < 0.01). compared to baseline, a significant decrease in 1) sensation of  anorectal obstruction from 90.0% to 45.0% (p < 0.01), 2) sensation of incomplete  evacuation from 90.0% to 40.0% (p < 0.01), 3) straining during defecation from 100% to 65% (p = 0.01), 4) episodes of abdominal pain from 60% to 20% (p = 0.01)  and 5) the presence of reflux episodes from 60% to 20% in week four (p = 0.01) was found. other secondary outcomes did not decrease significantly. no side effects were reported. conclusions: ecologic(r)relief is effective in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy. a randomised placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.

TI  == ability of lactobacillus rhamnosus gaf01 to remove afm1 in vitro and to counteract afm1 immunotoxicity in vivo.
AB  == aflatoxin m1 (afm1) has been detected in many parts of the world both in raw milk and many dairy products, causing great economic losses and human disease. unfortunately, there are few studies dealing with afm1 immunotoxicity/interactions with lactic acid bacteria for potential application as a natural preventive agent. the aim of this study was to isolate (from dairy products) food-grade probiotic bacteria able to degrade/bind afm1 in vitro and evaluate whether the same organism(s) could impart a protective role against afm1-induced immunotoxicity in exposed balb/c mice. bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum mon03 and l. rhamnosus gaf01) were isolated from tunisian artisanal butter and then tested for abilities to eliminate afm1 from phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and reconstituted milk (containing 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 microg afm1/ml) after 0, 6, and 24 h at 37 degrees c. results showed that the selected bacteria could 'remove' afm1 both in pbs and skimmed milk. the binding abilities  of afm1 by l. plantarum mon03 and l. rhamnosus gaf01 strains (at 10(8) cfu/ml) in pbs and reconstituted milk ranged, respectively, from 16.1-78.6% and 15.3-95.1%;  overall, l. rhamnosus showed a better potential for removal than l. plantarum. 'removal' appeared to be by simple binding; the bacteria/afm1 complex was stable  and only a very small proportion of mycotoxin was released back into the solution. l. rhamnosus gaf01 had the highest binding capacity and was selected for use in the in vivo study. those results indicated that use of the organism prevented afm1-induced effects on total white and red blood cells, and lymphocyte subtypes, after 15 days of host treatment. these studies clearly indicated that l. rhamnosus gaf01 was able to bind afm1 in vitro and-by mechanisms that might also be related to a binding effect-counteract afm1-induced immunotoxicity. moreover, by itself, this bacterium was not toxic and could potentially be used as an additive in dairy products and in biotechnology for mycotoxin detoxification.

TI  == inhibition of fe-induced colon oxidative stress by lactobacilli in mice.
AB  == iron (fe) can promote hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and hydroxyl radical generation in the colonic surface and promote growth of fe-dependent bacteria. some lactobacillus strains are resistant to oxygen free-radicals, allowing them to survive in a fe-modulated mucosal environment and influence colon microbial ecology and redox state. here, we investigated the capacity of lactobacilli with  different antioxidant abilities to modify the bacterial profile and prevent oxidative stress in the colon of fe-overloaded mice. survival time of lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg (lgg) in the presence of h(2)o(2) and hydroxyl radical was significantly longer compared with the mid- and non-antioxidative strains, lactobacillus paracasei fn032 and lactobacillus plantarum fn001, respectively. different lactobacillus strains are specific in free-radical scavenging activities of their cell-free extracts, which increased to varying extent depending on strains when bacteria were exposed to simulated gastric and pancreatic juice. fe-overloaded mice showed increased colonic luminal ferrous fe  content, enterococcus and escherichia coli concentrations, mucosal malondialdehyde and free-radicals, and decreased mucosal total antioxidative capacity and oxidative enzymatic activity. translocation of endotoxin to the liver was also significantly increased (p < 0.05). lactobacilli inhibited ferrous fe accumulation, especially in lgg and fn032. lgg significantly inhibited the increase of colonic mucosal free-radicals and malondialdehyde content (p < 0.05). fn032 only inhibited malondialdehyde (p < 0.05). lgg and fn032 significantly inhibited increases in colonic enterococcus (p < 0.05). fn001 showed no significant antioxidative ability in vivo. the difference of these effects in vivo were well agreed with scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species  (ros) of simulated gastrointestinals fluid pretreated cells in vitro. in conclusion, ros scavenging activities was essential for lactobacillus to prevent  oxidative stress in vivo and inhibition of ros-producing bacterial growth and mucosal barrier injury.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == the innovative potential of lactobacillus rhamnosus lr06, lactobacillus pentosus  lps01, lactobacillus plantarum lp01, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 to restore the "gastric barrier effect" in patients chronically treated with ppi: a pilot study.
AB  == background: gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very widespread condition. in europe, it is estimated that about 175 million people suffer from this disease and have to chronically take drugs to increase gastric ph. the proton pump inhibitors (ppis) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are the most widely used drug typology in this regard. however, the inhibition of normal gastric acid secretion has important side effects, the most important being bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum with a concentration of >10(5) viable cells/ml. as a major consequence of this, many harmful or even pathogenic  bacteria contained in some foods could survive the gastric transit and colonize either the stomach itself, the duodenum, or the gut, where they could establish acute and even chronic infections with unavoidable consequences for the host's health. in other words, the "gastric barrier effect" is strongly reduced or even  disrupted. to date, there are no real strategies to deal with this widespread, although still relatively little known, problem. the aim of this study was to confirm the gastric bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi consumers and to assess the efficacy of some probiotic bacteria, belonging to both genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, in the reduction of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth, therefore partially restoring the gastric barrier effect against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. methods: for this purpose, probiotics with a strong demonstrated inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, were tested in a human intervention trial involving a total of  30 subjects treated with ppis for either 3 to 12 consecutive months (short-term)  or >12 consecutive months (long-term). an additional 10 subjects not taking ppis  were enrolled and used as a control group representing the general population. four selected probiotics probiotical spa (novara, italy), namely lactobacillus rhamnosus lr06 (dsm 21981), lactobacillus pentosus lps01 (dsm 21980), lactobacillus plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021), and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  delbrueckii ldd01 (dsm 22106) were administered for 10 days to 10 subjects treated with ppis for >12 months (group b). in the 60 mg formulation, n-acetylcysteine was included as well in light of its well-known mechanical effects on bacterial biofilms. gastroscopies were performed at the beginning of the study (d0) in all the groups (a, b, c, and d) and after 10 days (d10) in group b only; that is, at the end of probiotics intake. the total viable cells and total lactobacillus were quantified in gastric juice and duodenal brushing material from all subjects. the results were compared among all the groups and with the control subjects (group d) to confirm the bacterial overgrowth. a comparison was made also between d0 and d10 in group b to quantify the efficacy of the 4 probiotics administered for 10 days. fecal samples were collected from all groups at d0, including subjects not treated with ppis, and in group b only at d10. specific bacterial classes, namely enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts were quantified in all fecal specimens. results: the results collected confirmed the strong bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum of people treated with ppis compared with subjects with a normal intragastric acidity. it is also worth noting that the bacterial cell counts in subjects who underwent a long-term treatment with a ppi were greater than the results from subjects taking these drugs for 3 to 12 months. the intake of 4 specific probiotic strains with a marked antagonistic activity towards 5 e. coli bacteria, including the enterohaemorrhagic o157:h7 strain, and an effective amount of n-acetylcysteine (nac) was able to significantly reduce bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi-treated subjects. total lactobacilli represented the major percentage of bacterial counts, thus demonstrating the ability of such bacteria to colonize the stomach and the duodenum, at least temporarily, and to consequently restore the gastric barrier effect. a significant decrease in fecal  enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts in subjects treated with ppis was recorded at the end of probiotics supplementation (d10) compared with baseline (d0) in group b. this is a further confirmation of the barrier effect also exerted at the stomach level. conclusions: ppis are the most widely sold and used drugs in the world. however, the chronic use of these pharmacological molecules exposes the subject to the risk of foodborne infections as most pathogens are able to survive the gastric transit in a condition of significantly decreased acidity.

AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

TI  == rumen microbial and fermentation characteristics are affected differently by bacterial probiotic supplementation during induced lactic and subacute acidosis in sheep.
AB  == background: ruminal disbiosis induced by feeding is the cause of ruminal acidosis, a digestive disorder prevalent in high-producing ruminants. because probiotic microorganisms can modulate the gastrointestinal microbiota, propionibacteria- and lactobacilli-based probiotics were tested for their effectiveness in preventing different forms of acidosis. results: lactic acidosis, butyric and propionic subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) were induced by  feed chalenges in three groups of four wethers intraruminally dosed with wheat, corn or beet pulp. in each group, wethers were either not supplemented (c) or supplemented with propionibacterium p63 alone (p) or combined with l. plantarum (lp + p) or l. rhamnosus (lr + p). compared with c, all the probiotics stimulated lactobacilli proliferation, which reached up to 25% of total bacteria during wheat-induced lactic acidosis. this induced a large increase in lactate concentration, which decreased ruminal ph. during the corn-induced butyric sara,  lp + p decreased prevotella spp. proportion with a concomitant decrease in microbial amylase activity and total volatile fatty acids concentration, and an increase in xylanase activity and ph. relative to the beet pulp-induced propionic sara, p and lr + p improved ruminal ph without affecting the microbial or fermentation characteristics. regardless of acidosis type, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that probiotic supplementations modified the bacterial community structure. conclusion: this work showed that the effectiveness of the bacterial probiotics tested depended on the acidosis type. although these probiotics were ineffective in lactic acidosis because of a deeply disturbed rumen microbiota, some of the probiotics tested may be useful to minimize the occurrence of butyric and propionic sara in sheep. however, their modes of action need to be further investigated.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus bfe5264 and lactobacillus plantarum nr74 promote cholesterol efflux and suppress inflammation in thp-1 cells.
AB  == background: the balance between the rate of cholesterol uptake/accumulation and the rate of cholesterol efflux is reflected in the amount of lipid accumulation in macrophages. based upon the fact that liver x receptors (lxrs) play a role in  cholesterol efflux, we studied the effects of probiotics on cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory action in macrophages. we confirmed changes in lxr expression by treatment of lxr-transfected cho-k1 cells with lactic acid bacteria (lab), and co-cultured thp-1 cells with lab to investigate changes in cholesterol efflux and inflammation. results: the experiment with cho-k1 cells showed upregulation of lxr-beta by lab. treatment of thp-1 cells with lab promoted lxr expression in thp-1, which eventually led to significant upregulation of abca1 and abcg1 expression. the treatment with live lab also significantly promoted cholesterol efflux. lab suppressed expression of interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, which resulted from activation of lxr. conclusion: our study shows that lactobacillus rhamnosus bfe5264 and lactobacillus plantarum  nr74 activated lxr and induced cholesterol efflux by promoting expression of abca1 and abcg1. both strains also suppressed proinflammatory cytokines including il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study could account for the observation that lab may block foam cell formation by cholesterol efflux and immune modulation.

TI  == microbial dynamics of commercial makgeolli depending on the storage temperature.
AB  == market fresh makgeolli was stored at different temperatures of 4 degrees c and 25 degrees c to assess the change of the microbial diversity according to the storage temperature and period. yeast counts increased until day 3 of storage and decreased thereafter. general and lactic acid bacterial counts continuously increased during storage. the data indicated that the control of growth of microorganisms, particularly general bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab), is  essential. total acid levels started to decrease in the makgeolli stored at 4 degrees c, and increased from day 6 of storage in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c. the increase of total acid in the non-refrigerated condition greatly affected the quality of makgeolli. in both the fresh makgeolli samples stored at  4 degrees c and 25 degrees c, yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) and molds (aspergillus tubingensis, candida glaebosa, and aspergillus niger) were noted. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) band patterns were almost constant regardless of the storage period. as for bacteria, lactobacillus crustorum, l. brevis, and microlaena stipoides were found in the makgeolli stored at 4 degrees  c, and l. crustorum, lactobacillus sp., l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. rhamnosus, and l. similis were found in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c. in particular, in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c, l. crustorum and l. plantarum presented  dark bands and were identified as the primary microorganisms that affected spoilage of fresh makgeolli.

AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal  pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. the majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin,  gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin),  except for three strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/ml), which are considered as resistant. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (lactobacillus fermentum 202, lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, l. rhamnosus 183, and lactobacillus plantarum l2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including escherichia coli and salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. in conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used  as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == stability of lactobacilli encapsulated in various microbial polymers.
AB  == various microbial polymers, namely xanthan gum, gellan gum, pullulan gum and jamilan, were tested as a suitable encapsulating material for lactobacillus plantarum crl 1815 and lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103. resulting capsules were also studied for their ph and simulated gastrointestinal conditions tolerance. the morphology of the microcapsules was studied using scanning electron microscopy. ph tolerance was tested at ph 2.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 6.5 over a 6h incubation period. simulated gastrointestinal conditions were assayed with simulated gastric and pancreatic juices and simulated bile over a 24h incubation  period. suspensions of probiotic organisms were used as a control. the results from encapsulation with microbial polymers indicate that mixtures of 1% xanthan gum with 0.75% gellan gum and 1% jamilan with 1% gellan gum were the most suitable for microencapsulation. results for the ph tolerance tests showed no improvement in the viability of cells in relation to the control, except for ph 2.0 where lactobacilli encapsulated in xanthan:gellan gum (1%:0.75%) prolonged their viability by 6h exposure. xanthan:gellan gum (1%:0.75%) was the most effective of the encapsulating materials tested in protecting l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus against simulated bile, improving its viability in 1-2 logcfu when compared with control. the results of this study suggest that microbial polymers  are an interesting source of encapsulating material that should be taken into account for prospective studies of probiotic encapsulation for oral delivery applications.

AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == modulation of th1/th2 balance by lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi via stimulation of macrophage cell line j774a.1 in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from kimchi, a korean traditional food, were tested for their capacity to modulate the t helper (th) 1/th2 balance. ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mouse splenocytes were cultured with 26 strains of lactobacilli; the highest il-12 induction and lowest il-4 production were then observed in 4 strains, including lactobacillus plantarum cjlp55, cjlp56, cjlp133, and cjlp136.  these strains produced a larger amount of il-12, which enhances differentiation and activation of th1 cells, in macrophage cell-lines more than positive control  strains l. casei kctc 3109(t) and l. rhamnosus gg, although they also induced production of il-10, which is a suppressor of il-12. indeed, cjlp133-stimulated macrophages induced production of more th1 cytokine ifn-gamma and less th2 cytokine il-4 than kctc 3109(t) and gg in co-cultivation with t cells. these findings suggest that lactobacilli from kimchi may modulate the th1/th2 balance via macrophage activation in the hypersensitive reaction caused by th2 cells. practical application: allergic reactions including asthma and atopy are caused by predominance of th2 response over th1 response. lactobacilli isolated from fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese, and kimchi showed health-promoting activities. the present study indicated that several lactobacilli strains from kimchi may reduce allergic reactions through macrophage-mediated induction of th1 response.

AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from kimchi, a traditional korean fermented vegetable product generally consumed raw as a side-dish with practically every meal. twelve mild acid producing facultatively heterofermentative lactobacillus strains were selected for their potential as starter cultures for fermentation of kimchi, and  evaluated for their functional properties. eleven strains were identified as lactobacillus sakei and one as lactobacillus plantarum. the strains identified as l. sakei differed in some physiological features; of particular interest was the  fact that 9 of these strains produced l(+) lactic acid from glucose in presence of acetate. all strains were able to survive gastrointestinal conditions simulating stomach and duodenum passage. in addition, they showed higher adherence to ht-29 cells than lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a commercial probiotic  strain used worldwide. these strains also showed antimicrobial activity against a number of food-borne pathogens. their ability to lower cholesterol was demonstrated by bsh (bile salt hydrolytic) activity, and cholesterol assimilation tests in vitro. the results suggest the probiotic potential of these strains for  use in kimchi fermentation.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus from algerian goat's milk based on phenotypic,  16s rdna sequencing and their technological properties.
AB  == nineteen strains of lactobacillus isolated from goat's milk from farms in north-west of algeria were characterized. isolates were identified by phenotypic, physiological and genotypic methods and some of their important technological properties were studied. phenotypic characterization was carried out by studying  physiological, morphological characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation patterns using api 50 chl system. isolates were also characterized by partial 16s rdna sequencing. results obtained with phenotypic methods were correlated with the genotypic characterization and 13 isolates were identified as l. plantarum, two isolates as l. rhamnosus and one isolate as l. fermentum. three isolates identified as l. plantarum by phenotypic characterization were found to be l. pentosus by the genotypic method. a large diversity in technological properties (acid production in skim milk, exopolysaccharide production, aminopeptidase activity, antibacterial activity and antibiotic susceptibility) was observed. based on these results, two strains of l. plantarum (lbms16 and lbms21) and one strain of l. rhamnosus (lbmf25) have been tentatively selected for use as starter cultures in the manufacture of artisanal fermented dairy products in algeria.

TI  == pulse probiotic administration induces repeated small intestinal muc3 expression  in rats.
AB  == upon ingestion, probiotics may act to protect the host through a number of protective mechanisms including modulation of genes involved in intestinal innate mucosal defense such as epithelial cell-derived mucin glycoproteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. to determine the specificity of effect and sustainability  of response in vivo, lactobacillus plantarum 299v (lp299v), lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 (lrr0011), and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 (bbr0071) were added repeatedly or intermittently to the drinking water of sprague-dawley rats. after  killing the rats via co2 suffocation, muc2, muc3, neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (naip), human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1/cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (hiap1/ciap2), and human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2/cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (hiap2/ciap1) mrna and protein levels were analyzed via  rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry. live lp299v, bbr0071, and lrr0011 increased muc3 protein and mrna expression in jejunum and ileum. heat-killed and a nonadherent derivative of lp299v failed to induce muc3 expression. lp299v did induce expression of hiap2/ciap1 and naip expression. muc3 mucin expression was elevated for 5 d after oral administration of lp299v; however, this effect was not sustained despite ongoing daily ingestion of a probiotic. intermittent pulse ingestion of probiotics, however, was found to repeatedly increase muc3 expression. we conclude that selected probiotics can induce protective genes of mucosal intestinal epithelial cells, an effect that is reproducible with pulse probiotic administration.

TI  == [classification of domestic probiotic cultures of lactobacillus genus].
AB  == aim: to study strains of bacteria from lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. materials and methods: thirteen cultures of lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: l. plantarum cs 396, l. plantarum 8-pa-3, l. plantarum 421-2, l. fermentum 90-tc-4, l. delbrueckii gknm 101, l. delbrueckii gknm 526, l. acidophilus er 317/402 narine, l. acidophilus 100 ash, l. acidophilus nk-1, l. acidophilus nnie, l. acidophilus k3sh24, l. brevis gknm 23 11, l. casei gknm 577. their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using api-50 system. structure of proximal region of 16s rrna gene was studied also. results: according to results of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) l. casei gknm 577, l. plantarum 8-pa-3, l. plantarum cs 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16s rrna gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures nk-1, er315/402 narine, 100 ash, nnie identified  early as l. acidophilus belong to species l. helveticus; l. brevis gknm 23 and l. acidophilus k3sh24--to group l. casei/paracasei, l. delbrueckii gknm 101 and l. fermentum 90-tc-4--to l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii gknm 526--to l. fermentum, and l. plantarum 421-2--to l. rhamnosus. conclusion: obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of  lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == rapid molecular identification and characteristics of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == eleven type strains and 24 lactobacillus isolates, preliminarily classified to the species due to phenotypic features, were investigated. standard methods of identification with species-specific pcrs and typing with pfge (with apai, noti and smai restriction enzymes) allowed us to distinguish 16 unique strains belonging to 5 species (l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. salivarius). alternative approach with 16s-23s rdna ardra identification (with merely two restrictases, bsuri and taqi) and pcr-based typing (rapd with two random- and rep-pcr with (gtg)(5) primers) showed to be more discriminative, i.e. 21 unique strains were classified in the same species as above. as a result, 7 out of 24 phenotypically species-assigned isolates were  reclassified. the alternative procedure of rapid identification and typing of lactobacillus isolates appeared to be equally effective and shortened from 1 week to 2-3 d (in comparison to the standard methods).

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

TI  == synthesis of isoflavone aglycones and equol in soy milks fermented by food-related lactic acid bacteria and their effect on human intestinal caco-2 cells.
AB  == one hundred and three strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from various food ecosystems, were assayed for beta-glucosidase activity toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside substrate. lactobacillus plantarum dppma24w  and dppmasl33, lactobacillus fermentum dppma114, and lactobacillus rhamnosus dppmaaz1 showed the highest activities and were selected as the mixed starter to  ferment various soy milk preparations, which mainly differed for chemical composition, protein dispersibility index, and size dimension. the soy milk made  with organically farmed soybeans (ofs) was selected as the best preparation. all  selected strains grew well in ofs soy milk, reaching almost the same values of cell density (ca. 8.5 log cfu/ml). after 96 h of fermentation with the selected mixed starter, ofs soy milk contained 57.0 mum daidzein, 140.3 mum genistein, 20.4 mum glycitein, and 37.3 mum equol. fermented and nonfermented ofs soy milks  were used for the in vitro assays on intestinal human caco-2/tc7 cells. fermented ofs soy milk markedly inhibited the inflammatory status of caco-2/tc7 cells as induced by treatment with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) (1000 u/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) (100 ng/ml), maintained the integrity of the tight junctions, even if subjected to negative stimulation by ifn-gamma, and markedly inhibited the synthesis of il-8, after treatment with interleukin-1beta (2 ng/ml). as shown by using chemical standards, these effects were due to the concomitant activities of isoflavone aglycones and, especially, equol, which were synthesized in the fermented ofs soy milk preparation.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum dsm 2648 is a potential probiotic that enhances intestinal barrier function.
AB  == the aim of this research was to identify bacterial isolates having the potential  to improve intestinal barrier function. lactobacillus plantarum strains and human oral isolates were screened for their ability to enhance tight junction integrity as measured by the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) assay. eight commercially used probiotics were compared to determine which had the greatest positive effect on teer, and the best-performing probiotic strain, lactobacillus  rhamnosus hn001, was used as a benchmark to evaluate the isolates. one isolate, l. plantarum dsm 2648, was selected for further study because it increased teer 135% more than l. rhamnosus hn001. the ability of l. plantarum dsm 2648 to tolerate gastrointestinal conditions and adhere to intestinal cells was determined, and l. plantarum dsm 2648 performed better than l. rhamnosus hn001 in all the assays. lactobacillus plantarum dsm 2648 was able to reduce the negative  effect of escherichia coli [enteropathogenic e. coli (epec)] o127:h6 (e2348/69) on teer and adherence by as much as 98.75% and 80.18%, respectively, during simultaneous or prior coculture compared with epec incubation alone. as yet, the  precise mechanism associated with the positive effects exerted by l. plantarum dsm 2648 are unknown, and may influence its use to improve human health and wellness.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == anti-inflammatory actions of probiotics through activating suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) expression and signaling in helicobacter pylori infection: a novel mechanism.
AB  == background and aims: in spite of the international agency for research on cancer's definition that helicobacter pylori is the definite carcinogen of gastric cancer, the simple eradication of the bug is not enough to prevent resultant gastric cancer, and increasing microbial resistance further limits the  eradication application. therefore, probiotics, non-pathogenic microbial feed that can affect the host in a beneficial manner, could be an alternate way to enhance anti-inflammation against h. pylori. however, the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory actions is still unclear. in the current study, we hypothesized that suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) signaling could be a feasible anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics against h. pylori infection. results: h. pylori infection or their lipopolysaccharide stimulation led to significant increased expressions of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in ags cells and pretreatment of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly attenuated the expressions of these inflammatory mediators in accordance with the blocking action of nuclear factor-kappab nuclear translocation. probiotic administration increased expression of socs-2 and socs-3 and exerted the active socs signaling featured with earlier and higher expressions of socs-2 and socs-3. in contrast to weak inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases including p-38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, probiotic-induced socs expressions were mediated through either significant phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (stat)-1 and stat-3 or simultaneous inhibition of janus kinase (jak)2 phosphorylation, which is known to signal socs-2/socs-3 negatively. conclusion: anti-inflammatory signals of socs through stat-1/stat-3 activation and jak2 inactivation might be a key anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics, setting probiotics as a non-microbial strategy to h. pylori infection.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  == microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. in the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. this has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. they play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. they are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. probiotic microorganisms include the lab lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response  or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. the advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.

TI  == probiotic attributes of lactobacillus strains isolated from food and of human origin.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from various sources were identified on the basis of 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic region amplification and subsequent sequencing of the smaller intergenic region. an in vitro analysis of probiotic properties including binding, ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile, survival in acidic buffer and antimicrobial activity of four different isolates and two standard strains (lactobacillus plantarum american type culture collection (atcc) 8014 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg)) was carried out. the ability of each isolate to stimulate caco-2 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and thp-1 cells resulting in immunomodulation of these cells was analysed. isolates l. rhamnosus cs25 and l. delbrueckii m and standard strain atcc 8014 showed broad antimicrobial activity, and isolates cs25 (percentage of survival 6.9 % at ph 2.5, 5.1 % at ph 2.0) and l. plantarum cs23 (5.7 % at ph 2.5, 4.9 % at ph 2.0) have shown good tolerance to acidic ph. isolate cs23 showed a good survival (14 %) after 2 h incubation in de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium containing 3 %  bile salts. isolates cs23, cs25 and l. fermentum ast1 could stimulate caco-2 cells, human pbmc and thp-1 cells for a strong and varied immunomodulatory response in these cells. though lgg showed poor antimicrobial activity as well as bile and acid tolerance, it was found to be the best binding strain tested. child faecal isolate cs23 from the present study showed high binding ability (seventeen bacteria/caco-2), high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts and significant immunomodulation; therefore it is a good potential probiotic candidate.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

TI  == effects of enteropathogenic bacteria & lactobacilli on chemokine secretion & toll like receptor gene expression in two human colonic epithelial cell lines.
AB  == background & objective: the intestinal epithelium is part of the innate immune system responding to contact with pathogenic or commensal bacteria. the objective of this study was to compare innate responses of intestinal epithelial cell lines to pathogenic bacteria and to lactobacilli. methods: two human intestinal epithelial cell lines, ht29 (enterocyte-like) and t84 (crypt-like), were exposed  to pathogenic bacteria representative of non invasive (vibrio cholerae o1 and o139), adherent (enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, ehec) or invasive (salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri) phenotypes and to non pathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or lactobacillus plantarum. interleukin-8 (il-8) was measured in culture supernatant by elisa, while mrna from cells was subjected to  quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr for several other chemokines (cxcl1, ccl5  and cxcl5) and for toll-like receptors (tlr) 2, 4, 5 and 9. results: v. cholerae, s. typhimurium, s. flexneri and ehec induced il-8 secretion from epithelial cells into the medium. salmonella, shigella and ehec, but not v. cholerae, significantly increased mrna expression of cxcl1. none of the pathogens induced ccl5 or cxcl5. salmonella and vibrio significantly increased tlr4 expression, while vibrio and ehec decreased tlr5 expression. ehec also decreased tlr9 expression. lactobacilli attenuated the il-8 response of the cell lines to v. cholerae, salmonella, and ehec but did not significantly change the il-8 response to shigella. interpretation & conclusion: distinct patterns of epithelial cell chemokine responses were induced by the bacterial pathogens studied and these were modulated by commensal lactobacilli. alterations in tlr expression by these  pathogens are likely to be important in pathogenesis.

TI  == the identification of a low molecular mass bacteriocin, rhamnosin a, produced by  lactobacillus rhamnosus strain 68.
AB  == aims: this study focuses on the isolation and characterization of a peptide with  bacteriocin-like properties isolated from lactobacillus rhamnosus strain 68, previously identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing and originating from human gastrointestinal flora. methods and results: the peptide was isolated from a supernatant of bacteria maintained under restrictive conditions by a combination  of ethanol precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography. the molecular mass of the peptide as assessed by mass spectrometry was 6433.8 da. an isoelectric point  of 9.8 was determined by 2d-page. the peptide designated rhamnosin a inhibited micrococcus lysodeikticus atcc 4698 but did not inhibit lactobacillus plantarum 8014 or lact. plantarum 39268. inhibitory activity against m. lysodeikticus at concentrations used in this study was shown to be bacteriostatic rather than bacteriolytic or bactericidal. rhamnosin a retained biological activity after heat treatment (95 degrees c, 30 min) but was sensitive to proteolytic activity of pepsin and trypsin. conclusions: the n-terminal sequence of rhamnosin a, as determined by edman degradation and in more detail by blast analysis, did not show identity with any currently available lact. rhamnosus hn001-translated protein sequences, nor any significant similarity with other sequences in the nonredundant protein sequence database. being a small, heat-stable, nonlanthionine-containing peptide, rhamnosin a should be categorized as a class ii bacteriocin. significance and impact of the study: this study describes a partial bacteriocin sequence isolated from lact. rhamnosus 68 and broadens our understanding of bacteriocins.

TI  == comparison of the immunomodulatory properties of three probiotic strains of lactobacilli using complex culture systems: prediction for in vivo efficacy.
AB  == background: while the use of probiotics to treat or prevent inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has been proposed, to this point the clinical benefits have been limited. in this report we analyzed the immunological activity of three strains of lactobacillus to predict their in vivo efficacy in protecting against experimental colitis. methodology/principal findings: we compared the immunological properties of lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826, l. rhamnosus gg (lgg), l. paracasei b21060 and pathogenic salmonella typhimurium (sl1344). we studied the stimulatory effects of these different strains upon dendritic cells (dcs) either directly by co-culture or indirectly via conditioning of an epithelial intermediary. furthermore, we characterized the effects of these strains in vivo using a dextran sulphate sodium (dss) model of colitis. we found  that the three strains exhibited different abilities to induce inflammatory cytokine production by dcs with l. plantarum being the most effective followed by lgg and l. paracasei. l. paracasei minimally induced the release of cytokines, while it also inhibited the potential of dcs to both produce inflammatory cytokines (il-12 and tnf-alpha) and to drive th1 t cells in response to salmonella. this effect on dcs was found under both direct and indirect stimulatory conditions - i.e. mediated by epithelial cells - and was dependent upon an as yet unidentified soluble mediator. when tested in vivo, l. plantarum and lgg exacerbated the development of dss-induced colitis and caused the death of treated mice, while, conversely l. paracasei was protective. conclusions: we describe a new property of probiotics to either directly or indirectly inhibit dc activation by inflammatory bacteria. moreover, some immunostimulatory probiotics  not only failed to protect against colitis, they actually amplified the disease progression. in conclusion, caution must be exercised when choosing a probiotic strain to treat ibd.

TI  == oral treatment with probiotics reduces allergic symptoms in ovalbumin-sensitized  mice: a bacterial strain comparative study.
AB  == background/aim: evidence demonstrating an important role of the intestinal microbiota in the incidence of allergic disorders has led to the concept of using probiotics as possible antiallergic therapy. this study aimed to select a bacterial strain with the best antiallergic treatment effects from a panel of 6 bacterial strains in a mouse model of ovalbumin(ova)-allergic asthma. methods: ova-sensitized balb/c mice were orally administered the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve m-16v, b. infantis numres251, b. animalis numres252 and numres253, lactobacillus plantarum numres8 and l. rhamnosus numres6. after challenge by ova inhalation in the lungs, the response to methacholine was measured. pulmonary inflammation was assessed by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and for interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma. ova-specific ige, igg1 and igg2a were measured in serum. next, the effect on acute allergic skin reaction was measured after treatment with b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8. results: of the panel of 6 strains, b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8 inhibited (1) the response to methacholine, (2) reduced the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (3) reduced both ova-specific ige and (4) ova-specific igg1, whereas the other strains did not affect all these parameters simultaneously. b. breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. furthermore, b.  breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced acute allergic skin reactions to ova. conclusion: b. breve m-16v was identified as the most potent antiallergic strain.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria population in children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == aim: to determine the effect of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole treatment on the natural population of lactic acid bacteria in the intestinal tract and to determine if any of the strains developed resistance to antibiotics. methods: lactic acid bacteria were isolated from stool samples of 100 children. the isolates were identified based on biochemical characteristics and dna profiles obtained from polymerase chain reaction with genus- and species-specific primers. resistance to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, compound sulphonamides, chloramphenicol and vancomycin was tested using the paper-disk method. results: the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, enterococcus spp. and weissella spp. lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium  spp. were not isolated. all strains, except two, were sensitive to chloramphenicol and streptomycin. thirty-five percent of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, 50% to compound sulphonamides and 66% to sulphamethoxazole. conclusion: treatment with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole repressed a large number of lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract of children. a number of strains were resistant to sulphamethoxazole and may be used as probiotics to correct the imbalance in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == effect of homogenization techniques on reducing the size of microcapsules and the survival of probiotic bacteria therein.
AB  == this study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, bifidobacterium longum, b. lactis type bi-04, and b. lactis type bi-07. two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and microfluidics microfluidizer. various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number  of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). the traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. the size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. the smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. the greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log cfu/ml was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced  the viability of probiotic organisms.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == functional analysis of the plasmid pm4 replicon from lactobacillus plantarum m4:  determination of the minimal replicon and functionality identification of the putative sso.
AB  == in order to determine the minimal replicon and the single strand origin (sso) of  the plasmid pm4, different fragments of pm4 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned into pbem, a replication probe vector for lactobacillus. the deletion analysis results showed that the minimal replicon of  pm4 could be determined within a 1280bp fragment consisting of double strand origin (dso) and rep gene encoding replication protein. based on plasmid segregation stability assay and its ability to convert single-stranded dna (ssdna) to double-stranded dna (dsdna) by southern hybridization, an sso of replication was located at nucleotides -118-92 in the plasmid pm4, about 300bp upstream of dso. in addition, the host range assay indicated that plasmid pm4 could replicate in l. casei 05-21, l. rhamnosus as 1.2466(t) and l. plantarum 05-19 of all the tested lactobacillus strains. analysis of the pm4 replicon will  allow its use in constructing a food-grade vector for application in food industry.

TI  == lactobacilli stimulate the innate immune response and modulate the tlr expression of ht29 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum bfe 1685 isolated from a child's faeces and the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were investigated for their capability to influence the innate immune response of ht29 intestinal epithelial cells towards salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. furthermore, their capacity to modulate toll-like receptor expression of ht29 cells was investigated at the mrna and protein levels. tnf-alpha was used in cell culture with ht29 cells to mimic an inflammatory background, and in the presence  of this chemokine ht29 cells were sensitised to respond to the lactobacillus strains as evidenced by an increased response in il-8 production. in addition, when ht29 cells were first treated with lactobacilli and then infected with s. typhimurium, the il-8 levels in response to s. typhimurium were significantly higher, indicating that ht29 cells were sensitised by lactobacilli. neither of the lactobacilli was able to stimulate tlr4 production at the mrna level, however, tlr2 and tlr9 transcription levels measured by quantitative pcr were up-regulated when ht29 cells were incubated with lactobacilli, but not with s. typhimurium. up-regulation of tlr9 expression was higher for l. rhamnosus gg than for l. plantarum bfe 1685. expression levels of tlr2 and tlr5 were enhanced also  at the protein level as determined by flow cytometry after staining with the respective antibodies. in contrast, tlr9 expression was not significantly up-regulated, which may be explained by protein degradation, or possible down-stream regulatory effects. these findings show that stimulation of specific  signaling pathways occurs in the cross-talk between probiotic bacteria and gut epithelium cells, which can help to explain the adjuvant properties of probiotic  lactobacilli.

AB  == background: for some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. in this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. results: heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. these include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacilllus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, streptococcus entericus and lactococcus garviae. the increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxa, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. conclusion: we propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes  among the species.

AB  == this paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid plfe1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum m345. analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(b). a replication initiation protein repb was identified belonging to the repb proteins of the pmv158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. the transcriptional repressor protein copg and a small counter transcribed rna, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. a putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pmv158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. an open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (orit) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. the product of the  putative mob gene showed large similarity to the n-terminal region of the pmv158  family of pre/mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. we therefore suggest that the mob function in plfe1 is supplied in trans  from another plasmid present in l. plantarum m345.filter-mating experiments showed that plfe1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, listeria innocua, the opportunistic  pathogen enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == final ph affects the interference capacity of naturally occurring oral lactobacillus strains against mutans streptococci.
AB  == objectives: to establish the effects of three factors: previous caries experience; colonization of streptococcus mutans; and final ph on autologous lactobacilli-mediated inhibition against a panel of mutans streptococci in young  subjects with different caries experiences. design: the inhibition capacity was determined by the use of the agar overlay method and the final ph in culture medium was measured after 20 h. using a logistic regression model, the risk of having an incomplete lactobacilli-mediated inhibition was calculated. results: all three factors significantly influenced the interference outcome in the order; final ph of the lactobacillus strains, oral colonization of autologous s. mutans  and caries experience. a high risk occurred at a lower ph and at a wider ph range for individuals with previous caries experience and autologous colonization of s. mutans compared with caries-free subjects who were not colonized. at a final ph of 4.0, this risk was approximately eight times higher than that of the latter group. two mutans streptococcus strains in the test panel demonstrated high individual predictive values of inhibition mediated by oral lactobacilli. conclusions: generation of a low ph either directly via organic acid production and/or production of bacteriocins or metabolites at a low ph may promote mutans streptococcus growth inhibition, in vitro. furthermore, a shift of ph range for the risk of incomplete inhibition of mutans streptococci suggests a less effective inhibition at a wider ph range for naturally occurring lactobacilli from individuals with earlier caries experience containing own s. mutans.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == ten probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-04, b. lactis type bi-07, howaru l. rhamnosus, and howaru b. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. the various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at ph 2 over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. the permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-cf). the permeability  was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-cf released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log cfu/ml was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. all encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-cf; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. in general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.

TI  == bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == effect of culture medium and cryoprotectants on the growth and survival of probiotic lactobacilli during freeze drying.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effects of the medium and cryoprotective agents used on  the growth and survival of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg during freeze drying. methods and results: a complex medium was developed consisting primarily of glucose, yeast extract and vegetable-derived peptone. trehalose, sucrose and sorbitol were examined for their ability to protect the cells during freeze drying. using standardized amount of cells and the optimized  freeze drying media, the effect of the growth medium on cell survival during freeze drying was investigated. the results showed that glucose and yeast extract were the most important growth factors, while sucrose offered better protection than trehalose and sorbitol during freeze drying. when the cells were grown under carbon limiting conditions, their survival during freeze drying was significantly decreased. conclusions: a clear relationship was observed between cell growth and the ability of the cells to survive during the freeze drying process. significance and impact of the study: the survival of probiotic strains during freeze drying was shown to be dependent on the cryoprotectant used and the growth medium.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == intra-individual diversity and similarity of salivary and faecal microbiota.
AB  == in the present study, polyphasic analysis [cultivation, combined with the fingerprinting of individual isolates, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] was applied to study whether similar features concerning  the diversity and temporal stability of selected bacterial groups could be detected intra-individually in two different niches - the oral cavity and the colon - from ten adult volunteers consuming probiotics. the predominant bacterial microbiota, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group and bifidobacterial populations, were generally stable in salivary and faecal samples, with the greater diversity seen in faeces. furthermore, different species predominated at  the two different sites. lactobacillus group dgge profiles were unstable, yet the intra-individual profiles from faecal and salivary samples collected at the same  time resembled each other. the ingested probiotic product did not affect the stability of the bacterial groups studied. the culture-based analysis showed that most subjects harboured identical indigenous lactobacillus genotypes in saliva and faeces (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum group). thus, identical indigenous lactobacilli were able to inhabit both ends of the orogastrointestinal tract, whereas the composition of the other bacterial groups studied varied between the  two sites.

TI  == sugar fermentation in probiotic bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == introduction: food supplemented with probiotic bacteria is a rapidly growing sector of the market. the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the acid production of selected probiotic strains available in commercial products. methods: six lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus plantarum 299v and 931; lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lb21; lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei f19, and lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289) were cultivated at 37 degrees  c in an anaerobic atmosphere on man, rogosa, shape (mrs) agar for 48 h or mrs broth for 16 h. after centrifugation, the cells were washed and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and immediately subjected to a fermentation assay with 12 different carbohydrates (nine sugars and three sugar alcohols) in microtiter plates with a ph indicator. the plates were examined for color changes after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. three scores were used: negative (ph > 6.8); weak (ph 5.2-6.8), and positive (ph  < 5.2). the strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. results: l. plantarum fermented all the sugars except for melibiose, raffinose, and xylitol. both l. rhamnosus strains were generally less active although l. rhamnosus gg was slightly more active than strain lb21 in the 5% co(2) setting. the latter strain exhibited negative reactions for sucrose, maltose, arabinose, and sorbitol under anaerobic conditions. the assays with l. paracasei and l. reuteri had negative or weak reactions for all tested sugars under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. conclusion: the metabolic capacity to form acid from dietary sugars differed significantly between the various probiotic strains.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == a new chance of preventing winter diseases by the administration of synbiotic formulations.
AB  == background: the efficacy of probiotics is currently well documented with regard to the improvement of gastrointestinal functions, whereas their potential role in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases has not been sufficiently analyzed. purpose of the study and methods: a 3-stage prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out with several synbiotic preparations containing 3 to 5 strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  rhamnosus, and bifidobacterium lactis, lactoferrin and prebiotics such as either  fos (short-chain fructooligosaccharides) or gos (galactooligosaccharides). the study was performed over 3 different winter seasons between 2003 and 2007, and was aimed at assessing the ability of the different preparations to improve intestinal functions and to increase the body's defences against respiratory infections. in 2003/04 (stage 1; 237 healthy volunteers) an active formulation (a) containing 3 probiotic strains and fos was used versus placebo; in 2005/06 (stage 2; 234 healthy volunteers) the same formulation versus a similar preparation enriched with lactoferrin (b), and versus placebo; in 2006/07 (stage  3; 250 healthy volunteers), 2 new synbiotic formulations each containing 5 probiotics and fos (c) or gos (d), respectively, versus placebo. results: in stage 1, bowel functions improved (p=0.004) in terms of reduced bloating and more regular intestinal motility. the length of acute respiratory infection episodes considered as a whole (-0.97 d; p=0.007) and upper respiratory tract infections (urtis, -1.96 d; p=0.044) were significantly decreased in the synbiotic group. the severity of episodes recorded a statistically significant drop in both episodes considered as a whole (3.21 average score vs. 3.98 in the placebo group, p<0.001) and in urti (2.56 vs. 3.82; p=0.004) and flu classes (3.80 vs. 4.67, p=0.001). in stage 2, improvement of bowel functions was statistically significant (p=0.005) in synbiotic preparation a. a statistically significant reduction in the number of respiratory tract infections episodes was noted with both the two active formulations (p=0.002 in group a and p=0.003 in group b). the duration of episodes considered as a whole (-1.12 d in one of the 2 active formulation groups; p=0.005), urtis (-2.08 d in group a; p=0.036) and influenza-like illness episodes (-1.40 d in group a; p=0.049) was significantly decreased in the synbiotic group. a reduction trend in cold episodes was also recorded. the severity of episodes recorded a statistically significant drop in episodes considered as a whole (-0.73 in group a, p=0.003; -0.65 in group b, p=0.004) and in the case of flu (-1.25 in group a, p<0.001; -1.18 in group b, p<0.001). in stage 3, the improvement of bowel functions was confirmed for both active formulations (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the total length of respiratory episodes (-1.51 d; p<0.001 in the group c and -1.39 d; p<0.001 in the group d) and in the length of cough (-3.08 d; p<0.001 in group c; -2.83 d; p<0.001 in group d), cold (-1.02 d; p=0.019 in group c; -1.32 d; p=0.001 in group d) and flu episodes was reported. the severity of episodes recorded a statistically significant drop in regard to episodes considered as a whole, the cold and flu classes in both groups and for cough too in group c. the number of episodes also dropped considerably in terms of overall episodes, cold (group c) and flu. conclusions: these results demonstrate that a regular, long-term intake  of various synbiotics may improve health by reducing the incidence and severity of respiratory diseases during the cold season.

AB  == adhesion of enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2  (human carcinoma epithelial) cells was visualized by fluorescent staining. both strains showed good adhesion compared to l. casei mb1, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1 and l. rhamnosus gg. no correlation was found between hydrophobicity, aggregation and adhesion to caco-2 cells. presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments reduced adhesion of bacterial strains to caco-2 cells. proteins sensitive to pepsin, trypsin and pronase are involved in the adhesion of e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells. adhesion of listeria monocytogenes scotta to caco-2 cells was not prevented by e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423. cell-free culture supernatants of strains st4sa and 423, containing the antimicrobial peptides plantaricin 423 and peptide st4sa, prevented the invasion of l. monocytogenes scotta into caco-2 cells.

TI  == effect of specific colostral antibodies and selected lactobacilli on the adhesion of helicobacter pylori on ags cells and the helicobacter-induced il-8 production.
AB  == helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis, gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma. it has proven difficult to cure because of its capability to develop strains resistant to antibiotics. the effect of three strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bovine colostral preparations on the adhesion of h. pylori nctc 11637 on gastric adenocarcinoma (ags) cells and on the interleukin (il)-8 production was studied. before infection, h. pylori were pretreated with lactobacillus plantarum mlbpl1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis, or with a colostral preparation with or without specific h. pylori antibodies. the relative number of h. pylori adhered on ags cells was determined by urease test. il-8 produced by the cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. colostral preparations with and without specific antibodies reduced the adhesion of h. pylori on ags cells in a dose-dependent manner. live lab at a concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml reduced the adhesion by approximately 50% (p < 0.05). after the infection of ags cells by h.  pylori, the il-8 level rose up to about 10-fold (5500 +/- 1600 pg/ml). pretreatment of h. pylori with colostral preparations or high concentrations of lab prevented this il-8 rise. similar effect was seen with live and heat-killed lab, the live lab being more effective. heat-killed lab at a concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml rose the il-8 level of non-infected cells significantly. suppression of il-8 production by lab or colostral products could have a suppressive effect on inflammation in helicobacter infection.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. recent studies indicated that some lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. however, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. therefore, we examined the effects of lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (cl(-)/oh(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial  cells. postconfluent caco-2 cells were treated with the lactobacillus species lactobacillus acidophilus (la), lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, or  lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)cl uptake in base-loaded cells. treatment with live, but not heat-killed, la and lr significantly increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. similarly,  the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live la increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange. the ability of la or its conditioned culture medium to enhance cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was blocked by pi-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. corresponding to the increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity, la treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, slc26a3 [down regulated in adenoma (dra)]. the increased dra membrane localization might contribute to the increased cl(-) absorption by la. our results suggest that la secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == probiotics for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated colitis in adults.
AB  == background: probiotics are live microorganisms consisting of non-pathogenic yeast and bacteria that are believed to restore the microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract altered by infection with clostridium difficile (c. difficile). objectives: to assess the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of  antibiotic associated c. difficile colitis. search strategy: the databases medline, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled trials and cochrane  ibd/fbd specialized trials register were searched to locate all published reports from 1966 to 2007. selection criteria: randomized, prospective studies using probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of documented c. difficile colitis were eligible for inclusion. data collection and analysis: data extraction and analysis was done independently by two authors. main results: four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. the four studies examined the use of probiotics in conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of c. difficile colitis in adults.  the studies were small in size and had methodological problems. a statistically significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one study. mcfarland 1994 found that patients receiving s. boulardii were significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience recurrence of c. difficile diarrhea (rr 0.59; 95% ci 0.35 to 0.98). no benefit of probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. authors' conclusions: there  is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for c. difficile colitis. there is no evidence to support the  use of probiotics alone in the treatment of c. difficile colitis.

TI  == acid, bile, and heat tolerance of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria.
AB  == eight strains of probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07, were studied for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance. microencapsulation in alginate matrix was used to enhance survival of the bacteria in acid and bile as well as a brief exposure to  heat. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested using hcl in mrs broth over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested using 2 types of bile salts, oxgall and taurocholic acid, over an 8-h incubation period. heat tolerance was tested by exposing the probiotic organisms to 65 degrees c for up to 1 h. results indicated microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria in mrs containing hcl. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to oxgall, viability was reduced by 6.51-log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.36-log cfu/ml was lost in microencapsulated strains. at 30 min of heat treatment, microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived with an average loss of  only 4.17-log cfu/ml, compared to 6.74-log cfu/ml loss with free probiotic bacteria. however, after 1 h of heating both free and microencapsulated probiotic strains showed similar losses in viability. overall microencapsulation improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions, bile salts, and mild heat treatment.

TI  == lactobacillus strain diversity based on partial hsp60 gene sequences and design of pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays for species identification and differentiation.
AB  == a phylogenetic tree showing diversities among 116 partial (499-bp) lactobacillus  hsp60 (groel, encoding a 60-kda heat shock protein) nucleotide sequences was obtained and compared to those previously described for 16s rrna and tuf gene sequences. the topology of the tree produced in this study showed a lactobacillus species distribution similar, but not identical, to those previously reported. however, according to the most recent systematic studies, a clear differentiation of 43 single-species clusters was detected/identified among the sequences analyzed. the slightly higher variability of the hsp60 nucleotide sequences than  of the 16s rrna sequences offers better opportunities to design or develop molecular assays allowing identification and differentiation of either distant or very closely related lactobacillus species. therefore, our results suggest that hsp60 can be considered an excellent molecular marker for inferring the taxonomy  and phylogeny of members of the genus lactobacillus and that the chosen primers can be used in a simple pcr procedure allowing the direct sequencing of the hsp60 fragments. moreover, in this study we performed a computer-aided restriction endonuclease analysis of all 499-bp hsp60 partial sequences and we showed that the pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns obtainable by using both endonucleases alui and taci (in separate reactions) can allow identification and differentiation of all 43 lactobacillus species considered, with the exception of the pair l. plantarum/l. pentosus. however, the latter species can be differentiated by further analysis with sau3ai or msei. the hsp60  pcr-rflp approach was efficiently applied to identify and to differentiate a total of 110 wild lactobacillus strains (including closely related species, such  as l. casei and l. rhamnosus or l. plantarum and l. pentosus) isolated from cheese and dry-fermented sausages.

TI  == characterization of dominant lactic acid bacteria isolated from sao jorge cheese, using biochemical and ribotyping methods.
AB  == aims: to identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) present in sao jorge cheese - one of the 11 portuguese cheeses currently bearing an appellation d'origine protegee status. methods and results: a total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening  were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. the most frequently isolated species were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecalis and  enterococcus faecium. ribotyping differentiated three l. paracasei, two e. faecalis and one lactobacillus plantarum types. enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. conclusions: the dominant lab in sao jorge cheese are l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. significance and impact of the study: our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific enterococcus and lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. hence, l. paracasei and e. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of sao jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

TI  == il-10-inducing adjuvants enhance sublingual immunotherapy efficacy in a murine asthma model.
AB  == background: il-10-inducing adjuvants could enhance the efficacy of allergy vaccines in establishing allergen-specific tolerance. the aim of this study was to identify such adjuvants using in vitro cultures of human and murine cells and  to evaluate them in a therapeutic murine model of sublingual immunotherapy (slit). methods: adjuvants stimulating il-10 gene expression by human or murine immune cells were tested sublingually in balb/c mice sensitized to ovalbumin (ova), assessing the reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness (ahr) by whole-body  plethysmography. the induction of regulatory t cells (t(reg)) was evaluated using phenotypic and functional assays. t-cell proliferation in cervical lymph nodes (lns) was assessed following intravenous transfer of cfse-labelled ova-specific t cells and facs analysis. results: a combination of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 plus  dexamethasone (vitd3/dex) as well as lactobacillus plantarum were found to induce il-10 production by human and murine dendritic cells (dcs). the former inhibits lps-induced dc maturation, whereas l. plantarum induces dc maturation. following  stimulation with vitd3/dex-pretreated dcs, cd4+ naive t cells exhibit a t(reg) profile. in contrast, a th1/t(reg) pattern of differentiation is observed in the  presence of dcs treated with l. plantarum. both adjuvants significantly enhance slit efficacy in mice, in association with either induction of foxp3+ t(reg) cells (for vitd3/dex) or proliferation of ova-specific t cells in cervical lns (for l. plantarum). conclusions: both vitd3/dex and l. plantarum polarize naive t cells towards il-10-expressing t cells, through distinct mechanisms. as adjuvants, they both enhance slit efficacy in a murine asthma model.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == lactobacillus-mediated interference of mutans streptococci in caries-free vs. caries-active subjects.
AB  == in order to assess whether naturally occurring oral lactobacilli have probiotic properties, lactobacilli were isolated from saliva and plaque from children and adolescents, with or without caries lesions. the interference capacities of these lactobacilli were investigated against a panel of 13 clinical isolates and reference strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as  against the subject's autologous mutans streptococci, using the agar-overlay technique. lactobacillus-mediated inhibition differed significantly between the three subject groups (no caries, arrested caries, or active caries), demonstrating increased inhibition in subjects without present or previous caries experience compared to subjects with arrested caries or subjects presenting with  frank lesions. lactobacilli from subjects lacking s. mutans inhibited the growth  of the test panel of mutans streptococci significantly better than lactobacilli from subjects who were colonized. furthermore, subjects without caries experience harbored lactobacilli that more effectively repressed the growth of their autologous mutans streptococci. twenty-three lactobacillus spp. completely inhibited the growth of all mutans streptococci tested. species with maximum interference capacity against mutans streptococci included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. naturally occurring oral lactobacilli significantly inhibited the growth of both test strains of mutans streptococci and the subject's autologous mutans streptococci in vitro, and this effect was more pronounced in caries-free subjects.

TI  == the role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  == background: inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. the aim of this  pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. methods: children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the rome iii criteria were eligible for the study. during a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (ecologic(r)relief) containing bifidobacteria (b.) bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, lactobacilli (l.) casei, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus. primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (bms) per week and stool consistency.  secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week,  abdominal pain and side effects. results: twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. the frequency of bms per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). in 12 children presenting with <3 bms/week, bms per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). the stool consistency was reported as hard in 7  children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after  4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). a significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). the  presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). no side effects were reported. conclusion: this pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. to confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.

TI  == preliminary characterization of wild lactic acid bacteria and their abilities to  produce flavour compounds in ripened model cheese system.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to preliminary characterize wild lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously isolated during artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheese-making for technological and flavour formation abilities in a model cheese system. methods and results: twelve lab were studied for the ability to grow at 10 and 45 degrees c, to coagulate and acidify both reconstituted skim milk and ewe's milk. moreover, the capacity of the strains to generate aroma compounds was evaluated in a model cheese system at 30- and 60-day ripening. flavour compounds  were screened by sensory analysis and throughout gas chromatography (gc)-mass spectrometry (ms). most of the strains were able to grow both at 10 and 45 degrees c and exhibited high ability to acidify and coagulate ewes' milk. sensory evaluation revealed that the wild strains produced more significant flavour attributes than commercial strains in the 60-day-old model cheese system. gc-ms data confirmed the results of sensory evaluations and showed the ability of wild  lactobacilli to generate key volatile compounds. particularly, three wild lactobacilli strains, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum species, generated both in 60- and 30-day-old model cheeses system, the 3-methyl butan(al)(ol) compound, which is associated with fruity taste. conclusions: the present work preliminarily demonstrated that the technological and flavour formation abilities of the wild strains are strain-specific and that  wild lactobacilli, which produced key flavour compounds during ripening, could be used as tailor-made starters. significance and impact of the study: this study reports the technological characterization and flavour formation ability of wild  lab strains isolated from artisanal pecorino cheese and highlights that the catabolic activities were highly strain dependent. hence, wild lactobacilli could be selected as tailor-made starter cultures for the ps cheese manufacture.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == racemization of l-lactic acid in ph-swing open fermentation of kitchen refuse by  selective proliferation of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == we have shown that stable lactic acid fermentation of model kitchen refuse occurs with intermittent ph adjustment under nonsterilized conditions. nonetheless, the  optical activity of the accumulated lactic acid was low, which is disadvantageous for the production of high-quality poly-l-lactic acid. here, we attempt to increase optical purity by introducing l-lactic acid-producing strains under nonsterilized conditions and demonstrate that the inoculation of lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactococcus lactis, both of which are l-lactic acid producers, is partially effective in the early fermentation stage, but does not improve the final optical purity of the accumulated lactic acid. we confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using group-specific and species-specific 16s rdna probes that this is due to the selective proliferation of naturally existing l. plantarum. l. plantarum ky-1, which is isolated from model kitchen refuse, showing lactic acid racemase activity, as well as d-lactate dehydrogenase activity, in its membrane fraction. we conclude that racemase activity associated with l. plantarum is the main cause of decreased optical purity in the accumulated lactic acid.

AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the elimination of ochratoxin a by lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the lactobacillus and lactococcus genera, assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin a and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. it was demonstrated that most strains are insensitive to the presence of ota at the quantity of 5 microg/disc. it was demonstrated that all strains caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. the highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial ota content, was caused by the strains lactobacillus acidophilus ch-5, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum bs, l. brevis and l. sanfranciscensis. the example of  three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of bacterial growth. a sharp decrease of ochratoxin a was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. in the course of cultivation the amount of the  toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially reversible. a small quantity of ochratoxin a became bound to the bacterial biomass.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the expression and secretion signals of the sep protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by lb.  fermentum br11, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. the production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. buffering of the growth media to a neutral ph allowed detection of ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. it was found that purified ply511 has a ph activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) by approximately 8 log(10) cfu/ml compared to controls. however, supernatants containing ply511 were unable to control l. monocytogenes growth. in coculture experiments, both lb. plantarum and lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce mrsa cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)cfu/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes. our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity.  lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of s. aureus infections.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether lactobacillus species found in african women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. the vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (bv), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal nigerian women, which were then gram-stained for nugent scoring. microbial dna was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). lactobacillus species were identified by dna sequencing and blast algorithm. results: of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had pcr products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the bv nugent scores. on sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. most women (64%) were colonized by l. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in canadian and swedish women. l. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by l. plantarum, l. suntoryeus, l. crispatus, l. rhamnosus, and other species. conclusion: the findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from northern countries.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

AB  == the antioxidative capacity of two lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi, a korean fermented food, was evaluated by measuring the resistance to reactive oxygen species (ros) and compared with that of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg as a positive control. both intact cells and cell-free extracts of lactobacillus plantarum kctc 3099 exhibited higher antioxidative activity in inhibiting lipid peroxidation among the strains evaluated with an inhibitory level of 38.6% and 48.5%, respectively. to evaluate the resistance of the two lactic acid bacteria to ros, we tested their survival in the presence of 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, 0.4 mm hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anions induced by 10 mm paraquat. l. plantarum kctc 3099 was viable even after 8 hours in the presence of both 1 mm hydrogen peroxide and 0.4 mm hydroxyl radicals. moreover, the survival of l. plantarum kctc 3099 was not affected by superoxide anions generated by using paraquat, indicating that it has resistance to superoxide anions. to define the antioxidative mechanism, superoxide dismutase (sod) and metal ion chelating activities were determined. l. plantarum kctc 3099 presented little sod activity, but had the higher level of chelating activity for both fe2+ and cu2+ metal ions  at 13.6 ppm and 23.9 ppm, respectively. these results suggested that the antioxidative capacity of l. plantarum kctc 3099 is apparently caused by chelating metal ions rather than by sod activation.

AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == characterization of a mobile clpl gene from lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == two genes encoding clpl atpase proteins were identified in a probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain, e-97800. sequence analyses revealed that the genes, designated clpl1 and clpl2, share 80% identity. the clpl2 gene showed the  highest degree of identity (98.5%) to a clpl gene from lactobacillus plantarum wcfsi, while it was not detected in three other l. rhamnosus strains studied. according to northern analyses, the expression of clpl1 and the clpl2 were induced during heat shock by > 20- and 3-fold, respectively. the functional promoter regions were determined by primer extension analyses, and the clpl1 promoter was found to be overlapped by an inverted repeat structure identical to  the conserved circe element, indicating that clpl1 belongs to the hrca regulon in l. rhamnosus. no consensus binding sites for hrca or ctsr could be identified in  the clpl2 promoter region. interestingly, the clpl2 gene was found to be surrounded by truncated transposase genes and flanked by inverted repeat structures nearly identical to the terminal repeats of the islpl1 from l. plantarum hn38. furthermore, clpl2 was shown to be mobilized during prolonged cultivation at elevated temperature. the presence of a gene almost identical to clpl2 in l. plantarum and its absence in other l. rhamnosus strains suggest that  the l. rhamnosus e-97800 has acquired the clpl2 gene via horizontal transfer. no  change in the stress tolerance of the clpl2-deficient derivative of e-97800 compared to the parental strain was observed.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == biofilm growth of lactobacillus species is promoted by actinomyces species and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. a dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus mutans and veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. in coculture with actinomyces species the amount of l. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and l. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. s. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but v. parvula had no effect. we conclude that these actinomyces species promoted growth of key lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did s. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability  of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.

TI  == development of a 16s rdna-targeted pcr assay for monitoring of lactobacillus plantarum and lact. rhamnosus during co-cultivation for production of inoculants  for silages.
AB  == aims: this paper reports a simple, rapid approach for the parallel detection of lactobacillus plantarum and lact. rhamnosus in co-culture in order to produce an  inoculant mixture for silage purposes. methods and results: the 16s rdna-targeted pcr primers were established for parallel detection of lact. plantarum and lact.  rhamnosus in a single multiplex pcr. a protocol for application of these primers  in direct pcr as well as colony-direct (cd) pcr was developed. these primers were also applicable for the estimation of the relative amount of each dna type in mixed probes (semi-quantitative pcr). conclusions: the pcr assay presented in this study is a robust, fast and semi-quantitative approach for detection of lact. plantarum and lact. rhamnosus in liquid cultures as well as on agar plates. significance and impact of the study: this method provides an effective tool for  the establishment of a regime for co-cultivation of lact. plantarum and lact. rhamnosus. this would enable faster and thus cost-reduced production of ensiling  inoculants.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == production of phenyllactic acid by lactic acid bacteria: an approach to the selection of strains contributing to food quality and preservation.
AB  == the ability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to produce phenyllactic (pla) and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic (oh-pla) acids, metabolites involved in food quality and preservation, has been evaluated by hplc analysis in 29 lab strains belonging to  12 species widely used in the production of fermented foods. metabolite production was demonstrated for all strains of the species lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus hilgardii, leuconostoc citreum, and for some strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acidophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. strains were distinguished by analysis of variance in three groups including 15 strains that produced both metabolites (0.16-0.46 mm pla and 0.07-0.29 mm oh-pla), five strains accumulating in culture  only pla (0.17-0.57 mm) and nine non-producer strains (< or = 0.10 mm pla and < or = 0.02 mm oh-pla). improvement of phenyllactic acid production was obtained in a selected l. plantarum strain by increasing the concentration of phenylalanine in culture and using low amounts of tyrosine.

TI  == use of folic acid casei medium reveals trimethoprim susceptibility of lactobacillus species.
AB  == aim: lactobacilli have been reported to have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. the susceptibility of lactobacilli to trimethoprim on different media was investigated in order to search for a phenotypic test method that could indicate the presence of acquired resistance genes. methods and results: strains  of lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum were susceptibility tested with e-tests on folic acid casei medium (facm), mrs and defined medium 1. the effects of addition or removal of nucleosides and thymidine phosphorylase were investigated. e-tests on facm yielded reproducible minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for trimethoprim but addition of nucleosides was necessary for growth of lact. acidophilus. mics for the tested strains were 0.125-0.19, 0.25-3 and 0.064-0.19 microg ml(-1) for lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum, respectively. with the addition of deoxyuridine and deoxyadenosine to facm the mics of lact. acidophilus were 0.064-1 microg ml(-1). conclusions, significance and impact of the study: lactobacilli do not have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. the results show that trimethoprim susceptibility testing of the tested lactobacillus species is possible and indicate that transferable resistance genes are absent in all the tested strains.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain,  alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double  layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI  == construction and use of a computerized dna fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from danbo cheese as adjunct cultures in a cheese  model system.
AB  == isolates of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) from six ripened danbo cheeses of different ages and of different brands were examined. special emphasis was on the genus lactobacillus with the aim of investigating their role in cheese maturation. thirty-three isolates were typed by the pcr-based method, randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). ten rapd types were found and 70% of the isolates were of rapd types found in more than one cheese. the different rapd types were identified to species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). most of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus paracasei (76%), but also lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus and some taxa originating from the starter culture were detected. in one cheese, no lactobacilli were found. one strain of the most frequent lactobacillus rapd type from each of the five cheeses with a lactobacillus flora was used as adjunct cultures in a cheese model system. four of the five adjuncts were re-isolated during ripening. two adjunct containing model cheeses received higher flavour scores than the control while two other were associated with off-flavours. the two model cheeses with off-flavour had a similar microflora and both were after 13 weeks of ripening dominated by a strain identified as l. plantarum.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == screening and selection of lactobacillus strains for use as adjunct cultures in production of semi-hard cheese.
AB  == thirty-three lactobacillus strains were tested as adjuncts in a cheese model system. eighteen strains originated from cheese (nine lactobacillus spp. and nine lb. paracasei/casei) and 15 from human intestinal mucosa (11 lb. rhamnosus; three lb. paracasei; one lb. plantarum). model cheeses weighing 120 g were made of cheese grains from full-scale production of washed curd semi-hard cheese (herrgard). the model system was reproducible and similar to full-scale production with respect to moisture, salt content, ph and microbial flora. the model cheeses were sampled for aerobic and anaerobic plate count and viable counts of lactobacillus and lactococcus. the presence of adjuncts in the model cheeses was confirmed by typing isolates with randomly amplified polymorphic dna  (rapd). the sensory properties of model cheeses were described. in a first trial  23 of the 33 adjuncts were re-isolated from the corresponding model cheeses after 9 or 13 weeks. adjuncts of lb. paracasei were re-isolated more frequently than adjuncts of lb. rhamnosus. nine strains were selected, on the basis of their ability to grow and be a dominating part of the microflora of model cheese with interesting sensory properties. these strains were further studied together with  two commercial cultures. the sensory influences on model cheeses of six of the adjuncts were confirmed, and flavour scores were in the range of 2.9-7.1 for model cheeses with different adjuncts while the control had a flavour score of 5.6 (0-10 scale). survival and growth of seven out of the nine strains correlated with the results of the first trial. growth and influence on flavour of four adjunct cultures were confirmed in experimental cheese manufactured in a 400-1 open vat.

AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == efficient protoplast regeneration for some homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  == conditions for protoplast regeneration were examined for several strains of homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci isolated from silage. attempts to regenerate protoplasts using previously published agar regeneration media for lactobacilli were unsuccessful for most of the strains. replacing or increasing colloidal substances in a medium containing raffinose and mgcl(2) as osmotic stabilizers enabled efficient regeneration of the protoplasts at a frequency of 10-99%. a medium containing gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) and no agar was effective for lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus rhamnosus protoplasts. an agar medium containing pvp (pvp medium) was effective for pediococcus sp. protoplasts, and addition of agarose to the pvp medium enabled regeneration of lactobacillus casei protoplasts. a medium containing calcium alginate gel and no agar was effective for lactobacillus curvatus protoplasts. the type of colloidal substance required for protoplast regeneration varied from species to species. this result suggested that several kinds of media may be necessary to regenerate protoplasts for all the genera of lactobacilli and pediococci.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

TI  == flavour profiles of dry sausages fermented by selected novel meat starter cultures.
AB  == probiotic or bioprotective lactobacillus rhamnosus strains gg, lc-705 and e-97800 as well as pediococcus pentosaceus e-90390 and lactobacillus plantarum e-98098 were studied for their ability to act as main fermenting organisms in the manufacturing process of dry sausages. in the preliminary tests, their abilities  to produce lactic acid and biogenic amines, histamine or tyramine, were studied in mrs broth and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. the strains  produced higher or equal amounts of lactic acid compared to control and were amine negative. during the actual fermentation process of dry sausages the numbers of inoculated bacteria increased from the level 6.5-7.0 log cfu/g to 8.0-9.0 log cfu/g. the most fast growing strains were p. pentosaceus e-90390 and  the control while the growth of l. plantarum e-98098 and l. rhamnosus lc-705 were the slowest. the ph value of the sausages decreased from 5.6 to 4.9-5.0. the presence of these experimental strains as major organisms in the sausages after fermentation and ripening was confirmed on the bases of their genetic fingerprints. the flavour profiles of the experimental sausages produced by these probiotic or protective strains were similar with that produced by the commercial meat starter culture and commercial north european dry sausage recipe.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == spatial and temporal distribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria in cheddar  cheese.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of species and strains of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) within cheddar cheese. methods and results: randomly amplified polymorphic dna was used to identify and track the principle species and strain groups of nslab present. the same strains dominated each location examined within a cheese at any particular time point. temporal change in species and strains of nslab during ripening was observed. a mixture of lactobacillus paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus and unidentified strains was found up to 6 weeks of maturation, thereafter only lact. paracasei strains were isolated. conclusion: little variation in the spatial distribution of nslab strains occurs within cheddar cheese; however, temporal changes in the species and strains were observed during ripening. significance and impact of the study: the complex changes in the composition of the nslab community of cheddar cheese may be the source of the variation in flavour that is seen in commercial practice.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == probiotics in foods not containing milk or milk constituents, with special reference to lactobacillus plantarum 299v.
AB  == lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. species such as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and  lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. in food, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy  products whereas l. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. a probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in sweden in 1994. the product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. it contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of l. plantarum 299v/l. the strain l. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. in humans, l. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. it can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption  and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. l. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. the mechanisms involved need to be clarified.

AB  == aim: the study was carried out to assess the agreement of api 50 ch fermentation  data of food lactobacilli with their rapd profiles to determine whether the system could be used alone as a reliable taxonomic tool for this genus. methods and results: api 50 ch, rapd and dna:dna reassociation data for 42 lactobacilli from tef and kocho were compared with 30 type strains. discrepancies were observed between the three methods in assigning strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lact. fermentum, weissella minor and lact. gallinarum, and lact. fermentum, lact. amylophilus, lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lact. rhamnosus. dna reassociation data agreed well with rapd results. conclusions: api 50 ch profiles should be complemented with molecular genetic results for effective identification in lactobacillus. significance and impact of the study:  the study suggested less dependability of metabolic data alone as an identification tool.

TI  == urea hydrogen peroxide reduces the numbers of lactobacilli, nourishes yeast, and  leaves no residues in the ethanol fermentation.
AB  == urea hydrogen peroxide (uhp) at a concentration of 30 to 32 mmol/liter reduced the numbers of five lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei, lactobacillus sp. strain 3, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum) from approximately 10(7) to approximately 10(2) cfu/ml in a 2-h preincubation at 30 degrees c of normal-gravity wheat mash at approximately 21 g of dissolved solids per ml containing normal levels of suspended grain particles. fermentation was completed 36 h after inoculation of saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of uhp, even when wheat mash was deliberately contaminated (infected) with l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml. there were no significant differences in the maximum  ethanol produced between treatments when urea hydrogen peroxide was used to kill  the bacteria and controls (in which no bacteria were added). however, the presence of l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml without added agent resulted in a 5.84% reduction in the maximum ethanol produced compared to the control. the bactericidal activity of uhp is greatly affected by the presence of  particulate matter. in fact, only 2 mmol of urea hydrogen peroxide per liter was  required for disinfection when mashes had little or no particulate matter present. no significant differences were observed in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in normal-gravity wheat mash at 30 degrees c whether the bactericidal agent was added as h(2)o(2) or as urea hydrogen peroxide. nadh peroxidase activity (involved in degrading h(2)o(2)) increased significantly (p = 0.05) in the presence of 0.75 mm hydrogen peroxide (sublethal level) in all five  strains of lactobacilli tested but did not persist in cells regrown in the absence of h(2)o(2). h(2)o(2)-resistant mutants were not expected or found when lethal levels of h(2)o(2) or uhp were used. contaminating lactobacilli can be effectively managed by uhp, a compound which when used at ca. 30 mmol/liter happens to provide near-optimum levels of assimilable nitrogen and oxygen that aid in vigorous fermentation performance by yeast.

TI  == surface properties of lactobacilli isolated from healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: lactobacilli are considered cariogenic micro-organisms. as oral species of lactobacilli have not been thoroughly described, the aim of this work  was to isolated and identify these organisms from teeth, tongue, saliva and gum of healthy patients and to describe some of their surface properties. subjects: forty-four subjects from tucuman, argentina, with d, d and m, m indices equal to  0. materials and methods: samples were obtained from different areas of the oral  cavity. microorganisms were cultured in lactobacilli selected media (lbs) and identified morphologically and biochemically. hydrophobicity was analysed by partition in organic solvents, acidity by affinity with chloroform and basicity with ethyl acetate (math method), aggregation and coaggregation in presence of (nh4)2so4, and haemagglutination with abo erythrocytes in microplates. results: eighty-five lactobacilli were isolated; 29.4% were homofermenter, 44.7% facultative heterofermenter and 25.9% obligate heterofermenter. predominant species were l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, and l. rhamnosus. most of the strains showed moderate to high hydrophobicity and demonstrated high acid and basic surface charges with almost 40% showing salt aggregation. few strains haemagglutinated. conclusions: a variety of lactobacillus species were isolated from healthy mouths, some of whom showed adhesion-related properties such as high hydrophobicity and charged surfaces. probable mechanisms related to the ecological behaviour of lactobacilli in the oral cavity are discussed.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == lactobacilli from human gastrointestinal mucosa are strong stimulators of il-12 production.
AB  == interaction of macrophages with bacteria is a stimulus for production of cytokines such as il-10 and il-12. il-12 stimulates t cell and natural killer (nk) cell cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production. il-10 opposes the t cell-stimulating action of il-12, decreases the release of proinflammatory  cytokines from macrophages, and stimulates b cells. we have studied the capacity  of human intestinal isolates from the three lactobacillus species dominating on the human gastrointestinal mucosa, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei ssp. paracasei, to induce production of il-10 and il-12 from human blood mononuclear cells, or monocytes. whole killed lactobacilli were potent stimulators of il-12 over a wide range of bacterial concentrations. lactobacillus paracasei gave the highest levels of il-12 (1.5 ng/ml in response to 5 x 106 bacteria/ml), roughly 10 times more than obtained by stimulation with l. rhamnosus or l. plantarum. escherichia coli induced on average < 50 pg/ml of il-12 regardless of the bacterial concentration used. the secretion of free p40 subunit il-12 followed the same pattern as the secretion of p70 (bioactive il-12) with regard to the efficiency of different bacteria as stimulators. escherichia coli was the most efficient trigger of il-10 production, inducing 0.5 ng/ml il-10 after stimulation with 5 x 106 bacteria/ml. lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the highest levels of il-10 among the lactobacilli (0.5 ng/ml) compared with 0.1 ng/ml evoked by l. plantarum or l. paracasei, but 10 times more bacteria were required for optimal stimulation than with e. coli. when neutralizing anti-il-10  antibodies were added to the cultures, the il-12-inducing capacity of l. rhamnosus was increased markedly, while that of e. coli remained low. the results show that mucosa-associated lactobacilli can be potent stimulators of il-12, and  thus potentially of cell-mediated immunity, if they pass over the gut epithelial  barrier and interact with cells of the gut immune system.

TI  == probiotics inhibit enteropathogenic e. coli adherence in vitro by inducing intestinal mucin gene expression.
AB  == probiotic agents, live microorganisms with beneficial effects for the host, may offer an alternative to conventional antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of enteric infections. the probiotic agents lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg quantitatively inhibited the adherence of an  attaching and effacing pathogenic escherichia coli to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells but did not inhibit adherence to nonintestinal hep-2 cells. ht-29 cells were grown under conditions that induced high levels of either muc2 or muc3 mrna, but hep-2 cells expressed only minimal levels of muc2 and no muc3 mrna. media enriched for muc2 and muc3 mucin were added exogenously to binding assays and were shown to be capable of inhibiting enteropathogen adherence to hep-2 cells. incubation of l. plantarum 299v with ht-29 cells increased muc2 and muc3 mrna expression levels. from these in vitro studies, we propose the hypothesis that the ability of probiotic agents to inhibit adherence of attaching and effacing organisms to intestinal epithelial cells is mediated through their ability to increase expression of muc2 and muc3 intestinal mucins.

AB  == the influence of oat bran oligosaccharides on carbohydrate utilization and fermentation end-products was studied with reference to three different lactic acid bacteria (lab: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis). the main results were that all three lab utilized oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides, while only l. plantarum utilized xylo-oligosaccharides. the main products of lab metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. the results indicated that oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides induce lab to form the end-products of a typical mixed-acid fermentation. the formation of mixed-acid production from xylo-oligosaccharides was mainly due to the starvation of cells.  this study indicates that oat bran oligosaccharides affect both qualitatively and quantitatively the fermentation end-products of lab grown on these substrates. this should be taken into account when selecting strains for new fermented cereal based food products.

AB  == the lactobacillus flora of the rectal and oral mucosa was sampled from 42 healthy volunteers. species identification was carried out by numerically comparing api 50ch fermentation patterns with type strains, using an sj-similarity cut-off level of 79%. for the largest groups, identity was further confirmed by dna-dna hybridizations against the type strain of the species. seventeen lactobacilli clusters were defined, of which most were found both on rectal and oral mucosa. the largest taxa were lactobacillus plantarum, lact. rhamnosus and lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, which were isolated from 52%, 26% and 17% of the individuals, respectively. most isolates were tested for their capacity to adhere to the human colonic cell line ht-29 in the absence and presence of methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. mannose-sensitive adherence to ht-29 cells was encountered in two-thirds of the lact. plantarum isolates, but infrequently among isolates of other taxa. the results suggest that lact. plantarum is a major colonizer of the human gastrointestinal mucosa, and that its capacity to adhere to mannose-containing receptors may be of some ecological importance.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus species by molecular typing.
AB  == a total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women,  namely, lactobacillus jensenii, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, and l. fermentum. six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. this technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. in the case of the ribotype a grouping for l. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). many isolates did not possess plasmids. six l. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to l. rhamnosus atcc 21052. the molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating lactobacillus isolates. studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.

TI  == effects of lactobacilli on yeast-catalyzed ethanol fermentations.
AB  == normal-gravity (22 to 24 degrees plato) wheat mashes were inoculated with five industrially important strains of lactobacilli at approximately 10(5), approximately 10(6), approximately 10(7), approximately 10(8), and approximately  10(9) cfu/ml in order to study the effects of the lactobacilli on yeast growth and ethanol productivity. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus #3, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus fermentum were used. controls with yeast cells but no bacterial inoculation and additional treatments  with bacteria alone inoculated at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml of mash were included. decreased ethanol yields were due to the diversion of carbohydrates for bacterial growth and the production of lactic acid. as higher numbers of the bacteria were produced (depending on the strain), 1 to 1.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid  resulted in the case of homofermentative organisms. l. fermentum, a heterofermentative organism, produced only 0.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid. when l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum were inoculated at approximately 10(6)  cfu/ml, an approximately 2% decrease in the final ethanol concentration was observed. smaller initial numbers (only 10(5) cfu/ml) of l. paracasei or lactobacillus #3 were sufficient to cause more than 2% decreases in the final ethanol concentrations measured compared to the control. such effects after an inoculation of only 10(5) cfu/ml may have been due to the higher tolerance to ethanol of the latter two bacteria, to the more rapid adaptation (shorter lag phase) of these two industrial organisms to fermentation conditions, and/or to their more rapid growth and metabolism. when up to 10(9) cfu of bacteria/ml was present in mash, approximately 3.8 to 7.6% reductions in ethanol concentration occurred depending on the strain. production of lactic acid and a suspected competition with yeast cells for essential growth factors in the fermenting medium were the major reasons for reductions in yeast growth and final ethanol yield when lactic acid bacteria were present.

TI  == use of virginiamycin to control the growth of lactic acid bacteria during alcohol fermentation.
AB  == the antibiotic virginiamycin was investigated for its effects on growth and lactic acid production by seven strains of lactobacilli during the alcoholic fermentation of wheat mash by yeast. the lowest concentration of virginiamycin tested (0.5 mg lactrol kg-1 mash), was effective against most of the lactic acid  bacteria under study, but lactobacillus plantarum was not significantly inhibited at this concentration. the use of virginiamycin prevented or reduced potential yield losses of up to 11% of the produced ethanol due to the growth and metabolism of lactobacilli. however, when the same concentration of virginiamycin was added to mash not inoculated with yeast, lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. paracasei grew after an extensive lag of 48 h and l. plantarum grew after a similar lag even in the presence of 2 mg virginiamycin kg-1 mash. results showed  a variation in sensitivity to virginiamycin between the different strains tested  and also a possible reduction in effectiveness of virginiamycin over prolonged incubation in wheat mash, especially in the absence of yeast.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
