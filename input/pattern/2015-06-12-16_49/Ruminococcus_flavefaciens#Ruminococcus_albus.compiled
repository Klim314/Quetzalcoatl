TI  - Characterization of the cellulolytic bacteria communities along the gastrointestinal tract of Chinese Mongolian sheep by using PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR analysis.
AB  - A balanced gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem is crucial for the health and growth of animals. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of ruminants, cellulolytic bacteria aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Rumen contents and feces in ruminants are often used to assess gastrointestinal microbial communities; however, these sites do not guarantee to represent the diversity of microbes found in the entire GIT. In this study, we investigated the microbiota along the GIT of five Chinese Mongolian sheep using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR analysis. Results indicated that microbiota were more abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. DGGE and real-time PCR revealed the predominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the GIT. Meanwhile, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium cluster IV showed significant difference in their abundance along the GIT (P < 0.05). Fibrobacter succinogenes was the most dominant species, followed by Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. The ileum harbored a larger number of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly-Clostridium cluster IV, than reported previously. In addition, comparisons between microbiota in the rumen and rectum indicated similar number of total bacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, F. succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Clostridium cluster IV, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, whereas the number of R. albus and R. flavefaciens was higher in the rumen. This study investigated the composition and quantification of GIT microbial community in Chinese Mongolian sheep, and revealed for the first time the cellulolytic bacterial community in these sheep.
TI  - Effects of garlic oil, nitrate, saponin and their combinations supplemented to different substrates on in vitro fermentation, ruminal methanogenesis, and abundance and diversity of microbial populations.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of garlic oil (G), nitrate (N), saponin (S) and their combinations supplemented to different forage to concentrate substrates on methanogenesis, fermentation, diversity and abundances of bacteria and Archaea in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in an 8 x 2 factorial design with eight treatments and two substrates using mixed ruminal batch cultures obtained. Quillaja S (0.6 g l-1 ), N (5 mmol l-1 ) and G (0.27 g l-1 ) were used separately or in binary and tertiary combinations. The two substrates contained grass hay and a dairy concentrate mixture at a 70 : 30 (high-forage substrate) ratio or a 30 : 70 (high-concentrate substrate) ratio. Ruminal fermentation and cellulolytic bacterial populations were affected by interaction between substrate and anti-methanogenic compounds. The inhibitor combinations decreased the methane production additively regardless of substrate. For the high-concentrate substrate, S decreased methane production to a greater extent, so did G and N individually for the high-forage substrate. Feed degradability and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were not decreased by any of the treatments. Fibre degradability was actually improved by N+S for the high-forage substrate. VFA concentrations and profiles were affected differently by different anti-methanogenic inhibitors and their combinations. All treatments inhibited the growth of Archaea, but the effect on Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens varied. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that substrate influences the efficacy of these inhibitors when they are used separately, but in combinations, they can lower methanogenesis additively without much influence from the substrate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presented research provided evidence that binary and tertiary combination of garlic oil, nitrate and saponin can lower the methane production additively without adversely impacting rumen fermentation and degradability, and forage to concentrate ratio does not change the above effects. These anti-methanogenic inhibitors in combination may have practical application to mitigate methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Functional phylotyping approach for assessing intraspecific diversity of Ruminococcus albus within the rumen microbiome.
AB  - Ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic bacterium, is a critical member of the rumen community. Ruminococcus albus lacks a classical cellulosome complex, but it possesses a unique family 37 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM37), which is integrated into a variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes. We developed a potential molecular tool for functional phylotyping of the R. albus population in the rumen, based on a variable region in the cel48A gene. cel48A encodes a single copy of the CBM37-associated family 48 glycoside hydrolase in all known strains of this bacterium. A segment of the cel48A gene was amplified from rumen metagenomic samples of four bovines, and its abundance and diversity were evaluated. Analysis of the obtained sequences revealed the co-existence of multiple functional phylotypes of cel48A in all four animals. These included sequences identical or similar to those of R. albus isolates (reference strains), as well as several novel sequences. The dominant cel48A type varied among animals. This method can be used for detection of intraspecific diversity of R. albus in metagenomic samples. Together with scaC, a previously reported gene marker for R. flavefaciens, we present a set of two species-specific markers for phylotyping of Ruminococci in the herbivore rumen.
TI  - Study of rumen metagenome community using qPCR under different diets.
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect the major bacteria present in rumen microbiota. Here, we performed qPCR based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to roughage diets. Animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 100:00 (T1), 75:25 (T2), 50:50 (T3) and 25:75 (T4) respectively for 30 days. At the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h and 2 h after feeding. It was found that among fibrolytic bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.22 x 10(8) copies/ml) were highest in T2 group and followed by 1.11 x 10(8) copies/ml for Fibrobacter succinogenes (T2), 2.56 x 10(7) copies/ml for Prevotella ruminicola (T1) and 1.25 x 10(7) copies/ml for Ruminococcus albus (T4). In non-fibrolytic bacteria, the Selenomonas ruminantium (2.62 x 10(7) copies/ml) was predominant in group T3 and followed by Treponema bryantii (2.52 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group T1, Ruminobacter amylophilus (1.31 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group T1 and Anaerovibrio lipolytica (2.58 x 10(6) copies/ml) in group T4. It is most notable that R. flavefaciens were the highest in population in the rumen of Surti buffalo fed wheat straw as roughage source.
TI  - Potential of tannin-rich plants for modulating ruminal microbes and ruminal fermentation in sheep.
AB  - The objective of this work was to study nutritional strategies for decreasing methane production by ruminants fed tropical diets, combining in vitro and in vivo methods. The in vitro approach was used to evaluate the dose effect of condensed tannins (CT) contained in leaves of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Manihot esculenta (39, 75, and 92 g CT/kg DM, respectively) on methane production and ruminal fermentation characteristics. Tannin-rich plants (TRP) were incubated for 24 h alone or mixed with a natural grassland hay based on Dichanthium spp. (control plant), so that proportions of TRP were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Methane production, VFA concentration, and fermented OM decreased with increased proportions of TRP. Numerical differences on methane production and VFA concentration among TRP sources may be due to differences in their CT content, with greater effects for L. leucocephala and M. esculenta than for G. sepium. Independently of TRP, the response to increasing doses of CT was linear for methane production but quadratic for VFA concentration. As a result, at moderate tannin dose, methane decreased more than VFA. The in vivo trial was conducted to investigate the effect of TRP on different ruminal microbial populations. To this end, 8 rumen-cannulated sheep from 2 breeds (Texel and Blackbelly) were used in two 4 x 4 Latin square designs. Diets were fed ad libitum and were composed of the same feeds used for the in vitro trial: control plant alone or combined with pellets made from TRP leaves at 44% of the diet DM. Compared to TRP, concentration of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was greater for the control diet and concentration of Ruminococcus albus was least for the control diet. The methanogen population was greater for Texel than for Blackbelly. By contrast, TRP-containing diets did not affect protozoa or Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers. Hence, TRP showed potential for mitigating methane production by ruminants. These findings suggest that TRP fed as pellets could be used to decrease methane production.
TI  - Influence of Yeast Fermented Cassava Chip Protein (YEFECAP) and Roughage to Concentrate Ratio on Ruminal Fermentation and Microorganisms Using In vitro Gas Production Technique.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein sources and roughage (R) to concentrate (C) ratio on in vitro fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. The experimental design was a 2x5 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design (CRD). Factor A was 2 levels of protein sources yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) and soybean meal (SBM) and factor B was 5 levels of roughage to concentrate (R:C) ratio at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, and 0:100, respectively. Rice straw was used as a roughage source. It was found that gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) of YEFECAP supplemented group was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in SBM supplemented group. Moreover, the intercept value (a), gas production from the insoluble fraction (b), gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c), potential extent of gas production (a+b) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were influenced (p<0.01) by R:C ratio. In addition, protein source had no effect (p>0.05) on ether in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic (IVOMD) while R:C ratio affected the IVDMD and IVOMD (p<0.01). Moreover, YEFECAP supplanted group showed a significantly increased (p<0.05) total VFA and C3 while C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production were decreased when compared with SBM supplemented group. In addition, a decreasing R:C ratio had a significant effect (p<0.05) on increasing total VFA, C3 and NH3-N, but decreasing the C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production (p<0.01). Furthermore, total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus populations in YEFECAP supplemented group were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in the SBM supplemented group while fungal zoospores, methanogens and protozoal population remained unchanged (p>0.05) as compared between the two sources of protein. Moreover, fungal zoospores and total bacteria population were significantly increased (p<0.01) while, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, methanogens and protozoal population were decreased (p<0.01) with decreasing R:C ratio. In conclusion, YEFECAP has a potential for use as a protein source for improving rumen fermentation efficiency in ruminants.
TI  - Effects of Methylcellulose on Fibrolytic Bacterial Detachment and In vitro Degradation of Rice Straw.
AB  - Two in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of methylcellulose (MC) on i) bacterial detachment from rice straw as well as ii) inhibition of bacterial attachment and fiber digestibility. To evaluate the effect of MC on fibrolytic bacterial detachment (Exp 1), in vitro bacterial cultures with 0.1% (w/v) MC solution were compared with cultures without MC after 8 h incubation. The effect of MC on inhibition of bacterial attachment was determined by comparing with real-time PCR the populations of F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and R. albus established on rice straw pre-treated with 0.1% MC with those on untreated straw after incubation for 0, 6 and 12 h (Exp 2). The major fibrolytic bacterial attachment on rice straw showed significantly lower populations with either the addition of MC to the culture or pre-treated rice straw compared to controls (p<0.05). Also, the digestibility of rice straw with MC was significantly lower compared with control (p<0.05). The F. succinogenes population did not show detachment from rice straw, but showed an inhibition of attachment and proliferation on rice straw in accordance with a decrease of fiber digestion. The detachments of Ruminococcus species co-existed preventing the proliferations with subsequent reduction of fiber degradation by MC during the incubation. Their detachments were induced from stable colonization as well as the initial adhesion on rice straw by MC in in vitro ruminal fermentation. Furthermore, the detachment of R. albus was more sensitive to MC than was R. flavefaciens. These results showed the certain evidence that attachment of major fibrolytic bacteria had an effect on fiber digestion in the rumen, and each of fibrolytic bacteria, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and R. albus had a specific mechanism of attachment and detachment to fiber.
TI  - Rumen cellulosomics: divergent fiber-degrading strategies revealed by comparative genome-wide analysis of six ruminococcal strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A complex community of microorganisms is responsible for efficient plant cell wall digestion by many herbivores, notably the ruminants. Understanding the different fibrolytic mechanisms utilized by these bacteria has been of great interest in agricultural and technological fields, reinforced more recently by current efforts to convert cellulosic biomass to biofuels. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we have used a bioinformatics-based approach to explore the cellulosome-related components of six genomes from two of the primary fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen: Ruminococcus flavefaciens (strains FD-1, 007c and 17) and Ruminococcus albus (strains 7, 8 and SY3). The genomes of two of these strains are reported for the first time herein. The data reveal that the three R. flavefaciens strains encode for an elaborate reservoir of cohesin- and dockerin-containing proteins, whereas the three R. albus strains are cohesin-deficient and encode mainly dockerins and a unique family of cell-anchoring carbohydrate-binding modules (family 37). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our comparative genome-wide analysis pinpoints rare and novel strain-specific protein architectures and provides an exhaustive profile of their numerous lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. This work provides blueprints of the divergent cellulolytic systems in these two prominent fibrolytic rumen bacterial species, each of which reflects a distinct mechanistic model for efficient degradation of cellulosic biomass.
TI  - Magnesium requirement of some of the principal rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Information available on the role of Mg for growth and cellulose degradation by rumen bacteria is both limited and inconsistent. In this study, the Mg requirements for two strains each of the cellulolytic rumen species Fibrobacter succinogenes (A3c and S85), Ruminococcus albus (7 and 8) and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (B34b and C94) were investigated. Maximum growth, rate of growth and lag time were all measured using a complete factorial design, 2(3)x6; factors were: strains (2), within species (3) and Mg concentrations (6). R. flavefaciens was the only species that did not grow when Mg was singly deleted from the media, and both strains exhibited a linear growth response to increasing Mg concentrations (P<0.001). The requirement for R. flavefaciens B34b was estimated as 0.54 mM; whereas the requirement for R. flavefaciens C94 was >0.82 as there was no plateau in growth. Although not an absolute requirement for growth, strains of the two other species of cellulolytic bacteria all responded to increasing Mg concentrations. For F. succinogenes S85, R. albus 7 and R. albus 8, their requirement estimated from maximum growth was 0.56, 0.52 and 0.51, respectively. A requirement for F. succinogenes A3c could not be calculated because there was no solution for contrasts. Whether R. flavefaciens had a Mg requirement for cellulose degradation was determined in NH3-free cellulose media, using a 2x4 factorial design, 2 strains and 4 treatments. Both strains of R. flavefaciens were found to have an absolute Mg requirement for cellulose degradation. Based on reported concentrations of Mg in the rumen, 1.0 to 10.1 mM, it seems unlikely that an in vivo deficiency of this element would occur.
TI  - Effect of tannins and saponins in Samanea saman on rumen environment, milk yield  and milk composition in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tannins and saponins in Samanea saman on rumen fermentation, milk yield and milk composition in lactating dairy cows. Four multiparous early-lactating dairy cows (Holstein-Friesian cross-bred, 75%) with an initial body weight (BW) of 405 +/- 40 kg and 36 +/- 8 day in milk were randomly assigned to receive dietary treatments according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The four dietary treatments were unsupplemented (control), supplemented with rain tree pod (S. saman) meal (RPM) at 60 g/kg, supplemented with palm oil (PO) at 20 g/kg, and supplemented with RPM at 60 g/kg and PO at 20 g/kg (RPO), of total dry matter (DM) intake. Cows were fed with concentrate diets at a ratio of concentrate to milk yield of 1:2, and chopped 30 g/kg of urea-treated rice straw was fed ad libitum. The RPM contained condensed tannins and crude saponins at 88 and 141 g/kg of DM respectively. It was found that supplementation with RPM and/or PO to dairy cows diets did not show negative effect on ruminal pH, blood urea nitrogen and milk urea nitrogen concentration (p > 0.05). However, supplementation with RPM resulted in lower ammonia nitrogen (NH3 -N) concentration (p < 0.05). In addition, propionic acid and milk production increased while acetic acid, acetic to propionic ratio, methane production, methanogens and protozoal population decreased with RPM and/or PO supplementation. Furthermore, addition of PO and RPO in the diets increased milk fat while supplementation of RPM resulted in greater milk protein and Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers (p < 0.05). The population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by any treatments. The findings on the present study showed that supplementation with RPM and RPO to diets of cows improved the rumen environment and increased milk yield, content of milk protein and milk fat.
TI  - Effects of isobutyrate supplementation on ruminal microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in Simmental steers.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of isobutyrate supplementation on rumen microflora, enzyme activities and methane emissions in Simmental steers consuming a corn stover-based diet. Eight ruminally cannulated Simmental steers were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square experiment. The treatments were control (without isobutyrate), low isobutyrate (LIB), moderate isobutyrate (MIB) and high isobutyrate (HIB) with 8.4, 16.8 and 25.2 g isobutyrate per steer per day respectively. Isobutyrate was hand-mixed into the concentrate portion. Diet consisted of 60% corn stover and 40% concentrate [dry matter (DM) basis]. Dry matter intake (averaged 9 kg/day) was restricted to a maximum of 90% of ad libitum intake. Population of total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and anaerobic fungi were linearly increased, whereas that of protozoa and total methanogens was linearly reduced with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Real-time PCR quantification of population of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Fibrobacter succinogenes was linearly increased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosidase were linearly increased, whereas that of protease was linearly reduced. Methane production was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. Effective degradabilities of cellulose and hemicellulose of corn stover were linearly increased, whereas that of crude protein in diet was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. The present results indicate that isobutyrate supplemented improved microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in steers. It was suggested that the isobutyrate stimulated the digestive micro-organisms or enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. In the experimental conditions of this trial, the optimum isobutyrate dose was approximately 16.8 g isobutyrate per steer per day.
TI  - Interaction of rumen bacteria as assumed by colonization patterns on untreated and alkali-treated rice straw.
AB  - Colonization patterns of representative rumen bacteria were compared between untreated rice straw (UTS) and sodium hydroxide-treated rice straw (SHTS). UTS and SHTS were incubated in the rumen of sheep for 10 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h using the nylon bag method. The population sizes of 13 representative bacterial species or groups were quantified by real-time PCR. The total bacterial population size (abundance) was similar in both UTS and SHTS. Fibrobacter succinogenes showed a higher population size compared to other fibrolytic species and was detected at a higher level in SHTS (3.7%) than in UTS (2.6%). Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were also detected at higher levels in SHTS (0.15% and 0.29%) than in UTS (0.03% and 0.18%). Population sizes of non-fibrolytic species, such as Selenomonas ruminantium, Anaerovibrio lipolytica and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were higher in UTS than in SHTS. Coefficient of determination (r(2) ) on population changes between bacterial species or groups were higher in UTS than in SHTS, suggesting the necessity of stronger bacterial interactions for UTS digestion. Therefore, not only colonization of fibrolytic species, but also synergistic interactions between different bacterial species may be key to the ruminal digestion of rice straw.
TI  - Effect of dietary physically effective fiber on ruminal fermentation and the fatty acid profile of milk in dairy goats.
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to characterize the relationship among rumen fermentation variables, milk fatty acid profile, and dietary physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) content in a study that controlled for the potential confounding effects of dissimilar dry matter intake among treatments. Ten multiparous Xinong Saanen dairy goats were divided into 2 groups with 2 ruminally cannulated goats per group. Goats in each group were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (high and low peNDF) according to a 2x2 crossover design with 2 periods. The peNDF content of alfalfa hay (proportion of neutral detergent fiber retained on an 8.0-mm screen) was 42.1% for the high-peNDF and 14.5% for the low-peNDF group. To ensure similar dry matter intake, each morning the amount of alfalfa hay consumed on the prior day by the high-peNDF group was determined (amount offered minus morning refusals), and this was the amount of hay offered to the low-peNDF group that day. Each adaptation period consisted of 21d, followed by a 9-d sampling period. Dry matter intake and milk production and composition were similar between treatments. Milk energy efficiency increased with low dietary peNDF. Duration of pH below 5.60 was longer for goats fed the low-peNDF ration compared with the high-peNDF ration (4.08 vs. 0.41h/d); however, mean rumen pH (6.05 vs. 6.13) was not different between treatments. Reducing dietary peNDF increased rumen total volatile fatty acids (114.6 vs. 95.1mM) and decreased chewing time (404 vs. 673min/d), but did not affect the ratios of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased with reduced dietary peNDF, but Ruminococcus albus proportions were not influenced by treatment. Reducing dietary peNDF decreased the proportion of iso C14:0, iso C15:0, and trans-11 C18:1 in milk fat, whereas the iso C17:0 and trans-10 C18:1 increased. This study demonstrated that low dietary peNDF in dairy goats increases rumen volatile fatty acids, reduces chewing time, and is correlated to the amount of F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens.
TI  - Combinations of nitrate, saponin, and sulfate additively reduce methane production by rumen cultures in vitro while not adversely affecting feed digestion, fermentation or microbial communities.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of saponin (0.6g/L), nitrate (5mM) and sulfate (5mM), alone and in combinations, on methanogenesis, rumen fermentation, microbial community, and abundances of select microbial populations using in vitro rumen culture. Combinations of nitrate with saponin and/or sulfate additively suppressed methane production, with the lowest reduction (nearly 46%) observed for the combination of all the three inhibitors. None of the treatments adversely affected feed digestion or rumen fermentation. All the inhibitors, either alone or in combinations, did not alter the abundances of total bacteria, Ruminococcus albus, or archaea. However, saponin, alone and together with nitrate and/or sulfate, increased the abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, but decreased that of protozoa. DGGE analyses revealed limited changes in both bacterial and archaeal communities by the treatments. The nitrate-saponin-sulfate combination may be an effective and practical strategy to mitigate methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Rumen microbes and microbial protein synthesis in Thai native beef cattle fed with feed blocks supplemented with a urea-calcium sulphate mixture.
AB  - The influence of slow-release urea ( urea-calcium sulphate mixture; U-CaS) in feed blocks on rumen micro-organisms, predominant cellulolytic bacteria, microbial protein synthesis and ecology was studied in Thai native beef cattle. Four animals with an initial body weight of 100 +/- 3.0 kg were randomly assigned to a 4 x 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments (U-CaS in iso-nitrogen feed blocks at 0, 120, 150 and 180 g/kg dry matter (DM), respectively; U-CaS replaced urea). After 21 days of experimental feeding, rumen fluid was collected at 0 and 4 h after feeding. The mean intake of feed blocks and other feedstuffs offered (rice straw and concentrates) amounted to 0.3, 2.3 and 0.6 kg DM/day, respectively. Inclusion of U-CaS did not altered pH and temperature in the rumen. However, ruminal NH3-N concentration decreased quadratically (p < 0.05) in response to U-CaS inclusion, with the lowest value at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. With inclusion of U-CaS, the populations of rumen bacteria increased quadratically (p < 0.05) and counts of fungal zoospores were linearly enhanced (p < 0.05), being highest at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. Supplementation of U-CaS increased the concentration of total bacteria linearly (p < 0.05) and of Fibrobacter succinogenes quadratically (p < 0.05), whereas Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by dietary treatments. Microbial crude protein yield and efficiency of microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis were linearly increased with different levels of U-CaS addition. Furthermore, current data clearly indicate that inclusion of U-CaS in feed blocks can affect micro-organism diversity and major cellulolytic bacteria.
TI  - Detection of fiber-digesting bacteria in the forestomach contents of llamas (Lama glama) by PCR.
AB  - The high fibrolytic activity and large biomass of strictly-anaerobic bacteria that inhabit the rumen makes them primarily responsible for the degradation of the forage consumed by ruminants. Llamas feed mainly on low quality fibrous roughages that are digested by an active and diverse microflora. The products of this fermentation are volatile fatty acids and microbial biomass, which will be used by the animals. The aim of this study was to detect the three major fiber-digesting anaerobic bacteria in the forestomach contents of llamas by PCR. In this study, we detected Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes in the forestomach contents of eight native llamas from Argentina.
TI  - Use of real-time PCR technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in Indian Surti buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
AB  - In the milk industry in India, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. Efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. Bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. Absolute quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify ten bacterial species in rumen fluid of Surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of Ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the ruminal Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Prevotella species. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Treponema bryantii and Anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Expression of cellulosome components and type IV pili within the extracellular proteome of Ruminococcus flavefaciens 007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ruminococcus flavefaciens is an important fibre-degrading bacterium found in the mammalian gut. Cellulolytic strains from the bovine rumen have been shown to produce complex cellulosome structures that are associated with the cell surface. R. flavefaciens 007 is a highly cellulolytic strain whose ability to degrade dewaxed cotton, but not Avicel cellulose, was lost following initial isolation in the variant 007S. The ability was recovered after serial subculture to give the cotton-degrading strain 007C. This has allowed us to investigate the factors required for degradation of this particularly recalcitrant form of cellulose. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The major proteins associated with the bacterial cell surface and with the culture supernatant were analyzed for R. flavefaciens 007S and 007C grown with cellobiose, xylan or Avicel cellulose as energy sources. Identification of the proteins was enabled by a draft genome sequence obtained for 007C. Among supernatant proteins a cellulosomal GH48 hydrolase, a rubrerthyrin-like protein and a protein with type IV pili N-terminal domain were the most strongly up-regulated in 007C cultures grown on Avicel compared with cellobiose. Strain 007S also showed substrate-related changes, but supernatant expression of the Pil protein and rubrerythrin in particular were markedly lower in 007S than in 007C during growth on Avicel. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides new information on the extracellular proteome of R. flavefaciens and its regulation in response to different growth substrates. Furthermore it suggests that the cotton cellulose non-degrading strain (007S) has altered regulation of multiple proteins that may be required for breakdown of cotton cellulose. One of these, the type IV pilus was previously shown to play a role in adhesion to cellulose in R. albus, and a related pilin protein was identified here for the first time as a major extracellular protein in R. flavefaciens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on in vitro fermentation and microbial communities of low-quality forages and mixed diets.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (XP, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) on in vitro ruminal fermentation of single forage and mixed diets. In Exp. 1, an in vitro test was used to determine the effects of various concentrations (0, 1, 2, and 3 g/L) of XP on ruminal fermentation of the major forage sources of China (rice straw, RS; corn stover, CS; corn silage without grain, CSNG; and corn silage with grain, CSG). Total VFA reached a peak at 1 g/L XP for RS, CSNG, and CSG and increased linearly (P < 0.01) for CS. The molar proportion of acetate decreased and propionate increased linearly (P < 0.01) with an increasing amount of XP for RS, CS, and CSNG. Microbial protein (MCP) increased linearly (P < 0.01) with an increasing level of XP for RS, and it reached peak values at 1 and 2 g/L XP for CSG and CSNG, respectively. Fungi population was increased (P < 0.05) with 1 g/L XP for all forages except CSNG. The population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased (P < 0.05) at 1 or 2 g/L XP for RS, CSNG, and CSG. In Exp. 2, the effects of 3 concentrations of XP (0, 1, and 2 g/L) were tested on in vitro ruminal fermentation of 3 mixed diets with various ingredient combinations: 1) CSC (corn:soybean meal:corn stover = 33:22:45), 2) CSCC (corn:soybean meal:corn stover:corn silage = 33:22:22.5:22.5), and 3) CSCCA (corn:soybean meal:corn stover:corn silage:alfalfa = 33:22:19:21:5). Total VFA concentrations were influenced by diets (P < 0.01) and were enhanced linearly by increasing concentrations of XP (P < 0.01). The molar proportion of acetate was reduced (P < 0.01), but the propionate proportion was enhanced with increasing concentrations of XP (P < 0.01). Ammonia N was decreased and MCP was increased by the addition of XP (linear, P < 0.01; quadratic, P < 0.05). The fungi population was greater with XP addition (quadratic, P < 0.01). The percentage of R. albus was affected by diets (P < 0.01), the level of XP (linear and quadratic, P < 0.01), and their interaction (P < 0.01). From these 2 in vitro studies, it is inferred that the addition of XP could improve the rumen fermentation of forages and mixed diets by stimulating the number of fiber-digesting rumen microbes, especially fungi populations.
TI  - Lovastatin-enriched rice straw enhances biomass quality and suppresses ruminal methanogenesis.
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that solid state fermentation (SSF) of agro-biomass (using rice straw as model); besides, breaking down its lignocellulose content to improve its nutritive values also produces lovastatin which could be used to suppress methanogenesis in the rumen ecosystem. Fermented rice straw (FRS) containing lovastatin after fermentation with Aspergillus terreus was used as substrate for growth study of rumen microorganisms using in vitro gas production method. In the first experiment, the extract from the FRS (FRSE) which contained lovastatin was evaluated for its efficacy for reduction in methane (CH4) production, microbial population, and activity in the rumen fluid. FRSE reduced total gas and CH4 productions (P < 0.01). It also reduced (P < 0.01) total methanogens population and increased the cellulolytic bacteria including Ruminococcus albus, Fibrobacter succinogenes (P < 0.01), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (P < 0.05). Similarly, FRS reduced total gas and CH4 productions, methanogens population, but increased in vitro dry mater digestibility compared to the non-fermented rice straw. Lovastatin in the FRSE and the FRS significantly increased the expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene that produces HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme for cell membrane production in methanogenic Archaea.
TI  - Effects of coconut and fish oils on ruminal methanogenesis, fermentation, and abundance and diversity of microbial populations in vitro.
AB  - Coconut (CO) and fish (FO) oils were previously shown to inhibit rumen methanogenesis and biohydrogenation, which mitigates methane emission and helps improve beneficial fatty acids in meat and milk. This study aimed at investigating the comparative effects of CO and FO on the methanogenesis, fermentation, and microbial abundances and diversity in vitro rumen cultures containing different doses (0, 3.1, and 6.2 mL/L) of each oil and 400mg feed substrate using rumen fluid from lactating dairy cows as inocula. Increasing doses of CO and FO quadratically decreased concentrations of methane, but hydrogen concentrations were only increased quadratically by CO. Both oils linearly decreased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility of feeds but did not affect the concentration of total volatile fatty acids. However, CO reduced acetate percentage and acetate to propionate ratio and increased the percentages of propionate and butyrate to a greater extent than FO. Ammonia concentration was greater for CO than FO. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, FO had greater inhibition to methanogens than CO, but the opposite was true for protozoal, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Ruminococcus albus was not affected by either oil. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed that bacterial and archaeal community composition were changed differently by oil type. Based on Pareto-Lorenz evenness curve analysis of the DGGE profiles, CO noticeably changed the functional organization of archaea compared with FO. In conclusion, although both CO and FO decreased methane concentrations to a similar extent, the mode of reduction and the effect on abundances and diversity of archaeal and bacterial populations differed between the oils. Thus, the use of combination of CO and FO at a low dose may additively lower methanogenesis in the rumen while having little adverse effect on rumen fermentation.
TI  - Effects of replacing dietary starch with neutral detergent-soluble fibre on ruminal fermentation, microbial synthesis and populations of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC).
AB  - A rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) apparatus with eight 800 ml fermenters was used to investigate the effects of replacing dietary starch with neutral detergent-soluble fibre (NDSF) by inclusion of sugar beet pulp in diets on ruminal fermentation, microbial synthesis and populations of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria. Experimental diets contained 12.7, 16.4, 20.1 or 23.8% NDSF substituted for starch on a dry matter basis. The experiment was conducted over two independent 15-day incubation periods with the last 8 days used for data collection. There was a tendency that 16.4% NDSF in the diet increased the apparent disappearance of organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). Increasing dietary NDSF level increased carboxymethylcellulase and xylanase activity in the solid fraction and apparent disappearance of acid detergent fibre (ADF) but reduced the 16S rDNA copy numbers of Ruminococcus albus in both liquid and solid fractions and R. flavefaciens in the solid fraction. The apparent disappearance of dietary nitrogen (N) was reduced by 29.6% with increased dietary NDSF. Substituting NDSF for starch appeared to increase the ratios of acetate/propionate and methane/volatile fatty acids (VFA) (mol/mol). Replacing dietary starch with NDSF reduced the daily production of ammonia-N and increased the growth of the solid-associated microbial pellets (SAM). Total microbial N flow and efficiency of microbial synthesis (EMS), expressed as g microbial N/kg OM fermented, tended to increase with increased dietary NDSF, but the numerical increase did not continue as dietary NDSF exceeded 20.1% of diet DM. Results suggested that substituting NDSF for starch up to 16.4% of diet DM increased digestion of nutrients (except for N) and microbial synthesis, and further increases (from 16.4% to 23.8%) in dietary NDSF did not repress microbial synthesis but did significantly reduce digestion of dietary N.
TI  - Ruminal fermentation and microbial ecology of buffaloes and cattle fed the same diet.
AB  - Although buffaloes and cattle are ruminants, their digestive capabilities and rumen microbial compositions are considered to be different. The purpose of this study was to compare the rumen microbial ecology of crossbred water buffaloes and cattle that were fed the same diet. Cattle exhibited a higher fermentation rate than buffaloes. Methane production and methanogen density were lower in buffaloes. Phylogenetic analysis of Fibrobacter succinogenes-specific 16S ribosomal RNA gene clone library showed that the diversity of groups within a species was significantly different (P < 0.05) between buffalo and cattle and most of the clones were affiliated with group 2 of the species. Population densities of F.succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens were higher until 6 h post-feeding in cattle; however, buffaloes exhibited different traits. The population of anaerobic fungi decreased at 3 h in cattle compared to buffaloes and was similar at 0 h and 6 h. The diversity profiles of bacteria and fungi were similar in the two species. The present study showed that the profiles of the fermentation process, microbial population and diversity were similar in crossbred water buffaloes and crossbred cattle.
TI  - Postprandial changes of fiber-degrading microbes in the rumen of sheep fed diets  varying in type of forage as monitored by real-time PCR and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis.
AB  - Four ruminally cannulated sheep were used in a crossover design to assess the postprandial changes of fiber-degrading microbes in the solid phase of the rumen of sheep fed 2 high-forage diets. The diets had forage:concentrate ratio of 70:30 (DM basis) and either alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay (AL) or grass hay (GR) as forage (FOR). Sheep were fed twice daily, and samples from solid rumen digesta were taken at 0, 4, and 8 h after the morning feeding. Postprandial changes of DNA concentrations of all determined microbial populations were similar for the 2 diets. Samples taken at 4 h after feeding had lesser (P < 0.05) concentrations of total bacterial DNA determined with real-time PCR and bacterial diversity and greater (P < 0.05) protozoal DNA concentrations, relative abundance of fungal, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus DNA compared with those taken at 0 and 8 h. No effect (P = 0.41 to 0.76) of FOR was detected either on concentrations of bacterial and protozoal DNA or the relative abundance of the 2 Ruminococcus DNA, but GR diet promoted greater (P < 0.001) relative abundance of F. succinogenes and fungal DNA compared with AL diet. Fibrobacter succinogenes was the most abundant (P < 0.05) of the 3 cellulolytic bacteria for both diets, with no differences (P < 0.05) between the 2 Ruminococcus species. Rumen pH and carboxymethylcellulase, Avicelase, and amylase activities were not affected (P = 0.15 to 0.69) by FOR, but xylanase activity was greater (P = 0.01) for GR diet. The influence of FOR on microbial communities in ruminal solid digesta was more evident in the first hours after feeding than at later times after feeding, which highlights the influence of sampling time when investigating dietary effects on rumen function and microbial populations.
TI  - Quantitative comparisons of select cultured and uncultured microbial populations  in the rumen of cattle fed different diets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number and diversity of uncultured ruminal bacterial and archaeal species revealed by 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences greatly exceeds that of cultured bacteria and archaea. However, the significance of uncultured microbes remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to assess the numeric importance of select uncultured bacteria and cultured bacteria and the impact of diets and microenvironments within cow rumen in a comparative manner. RESULTS: Liquid and adherent fractions were obtained from the rumen of Jersey cattle fed hay alone and Holstein cattle fed hay plus grain. The populations of cultured and uncultured bacteria present in each fraction were quantified using specific real-time PCR assays. The population of total bacteria was similar between fractions or diets, while total archaea was numerically higher in the hay-fed Jersey cattle than in the hay-grain-fed Holstein cattle. The population of the genus Prevotella was about one log smaller than that of total bacteria. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the genus Butyrivibrio, and R. albus was at least one log smaller than that of genus Prevotella. Four of the six uncultured bacteria quantified were as abundant as F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and the genus Butyrivibrio. In addition, the populations of several uncultured bacteria were significantly higher in the adherent fractions than in the liquid fractions. These uncultured bacteria may be associated with fiber degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Some uncultured bacteria are as abundant as those of major cultured bacteria in the rumen. Uncultured bacteria may have important contribution to ruminal fermentation. Population dynamic studies of uncultured bacteria in a comparative manner can help reveal their ecological features and importance to rumen functions.
TI  - Effects of quillaja and yucca saponins on communities and select populations of rumen bacteria and archaea, and fermentation in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate quillaja (QSP)  and yucca saponin (YSP) products with respect to their effects on diversity of rumen bacteria and archaea, abundance of selected microbes, and feed degradability and fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both QSP and YSP at doses 0-0.6 g l(-1) tended to increase degradability of feed substrate in in vitro rumen cultures, but to different extents. Neither one of the saponins affected the concentrations of ammonia, total volatile fatty acids, or molar proportion of acetate. However, QSP increased molar proportion of propionate and decreased that of butyrate, whereas YSP tended to decrease that of butyrate. As determined by qPCR, QSP and YSP did not affect the abundance of total bacteria or Ruminococcus albus. The QSP did not affect the abundances of Fibrobacter succinogenes or genus Prevotella, but tended to decrease that of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas YSP significantly increased the abundance of R. flavefaciens and Prevotella, and numerically increased that of F. succinogenes. Both saponins increased archaeal abundance, although to small magnitudes (0.3-0.4 log). The protozoal populations were decreased significantly by QSP, but not by YSP. Based on DGGE and T-RFLP analysis, both saponins altered the bacterial community and species organization, but less so the archaeal community. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that saponins, although not effective in mitigating methane emission, may improve feed utilization at low doses, and modulate ruminal microbial communities in a dose-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that saponins at low doses may directly stimulate the growth of some rumen bacteria including cellulolytic bacteria, thus improving digestibility of feeds, independent of their defaunation activity. In contrast, saponins at high doses modulate rumen fermentation characteristically similar to defaunation.
TI  - Use of Prevotella bryantii 25A and a commercial probiotic during subacute acidosis challenge in midlactation dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of Prevotella bryantii  25A as a probiotic during a subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge using a commercial probiotic as a positive control. Six multiparous ruminally fistulated cows (BW=685 +/- 65 kg; (mean +/- SD) in the mid-phase of lactation (70 to 148 DIM) received the following treatments in a replicated 3x3 Latin square design: (1) total mixed ration (TMR; control, CON), (2) TMR + 2g/head per day of a probiotic combination of Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EFSC), or (3) TMR + Prevotella bryantii 25A. The Latin square consisted of 3 wk of adaptation to the respective treatments during which the animals were fed ad libitum once per day a conventional early-lactation TMR and 1.5 kg of hay. The adaptation was followed by 4 d of SARA (no hay) and 10d of rest (adaptation diet without probiotics). Dry matter intake and milk production were depressed during SARA (22.0 and 31.8 kg/d, respectively) compared with adaptation (24.4 and 34.0 kg/d, respectively) and did not recover during rest (22.3 and 30.7 kg/d, respectively). During SARA, P. bryantii 25A had no effect on rumen pH, whereas EFSC reduced the percentage of time with pH <6.0 (71%) compared with CON (85%) and increased maximum pH. The EFSC treatment tended to increase mean pH over 24h (5.65) compared with CON (5.45). Proportion of time with pH <5.6 tended to be lower with EFSC (46%) than with CON (62%). Populations of bacteria considered to be the most important cellulose digesters in the rumen (Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes) were also monitored during these treatments using culture-independent real-time PCR methods. The population of R. flavefaciens was similar between the 2 feeding phases, whereas F. succinogenes and R. albus were lower during SARA compared with rest. In light of the present study, P. bryantii 25A did not prove to be an effective preventative for SARA. The role of EFSC in regulating rumen pH was confirmed, with a possible effect of maintaining R. flavefaciens populations during SARA.
TI  - Effects of Protein Level and Mangosteen Peel Pellets (Mago-pel) in Concentrate Diets on Rumen Fermentation and Milk Production in Lactating Dairy Crossbreds.
AB  - Four, lactating dairy crossbreds (50%x50% Holstein FriesianxNative Zebu cattle) were randomly assigned according to a 2x2 factorial arrangement (two protein levels and two levels of mangosteen peel pellets (Mago-pel)) in a 4x4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments. All cows received concentrate at a proportion of 1 kg concentrate per 2 kg of milk yield, and urea-treated 5% rice straw (UTRS) was given ad libitum. It was found that total dry matter intakes, nutrient digestibility, ruminal pH and NH3-N concentrations were not affected (p>0.05) by treatments. Concentrations of ruminal pH and NH3-N were not affected by dietary treatments although the concentration of BUN varied significantly (p<0.05) between protein levels (p<0.05). The populations of rumen bacteria and fungal zoospores did not differ among treatments (p>0.05); however, the population of protozoa was decreased (p<0.05) when cows received Mago-pel supplementation. The composition of the population of bacteria, identified by real-time PCR technique, including total bacteria, methanogens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus was similar (p>0.05) among dietary treatments (p>0.05); however, copy numbers of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was increased when protein level increased (p<0.05). Microbial protein synthesis, in terms of both quantity and efficiency, was enriched by Mago-pel supplementation. Milk yield was greatest in cows fed UTRS based diets with concentrate containing protein at 16% CP with Mago-pel, but were lowest without Mago-pel (p<0.05). In addition, protein level and supplementation of Mago-pel did not affect (p>0.05) milk composition except solids-not-fat which was higher in cows fed the diet with 19% CP. Therefore, feeding a concentrate containing 16% CP together with 300 g/hd/d Mago-pel supplementation results in changes in rumen fermentation and microbial population and improvements in milk production in lactating dairy crossbreds fed on UTRS.
TI  - Effect of phenotypic residual feed intake and dietary forage content on the rumen microbial community of beef cattle.
AB  - Feed-efficient animals have lower production costs and reduced environmental impact. Given that rumen microbial fermentation plays a pivotal role in host nutrition, the premise that rumen microbiota may contribute to host feed efficiency is gaining momentum. Since diet is a major factor in determining rumen community structure and fermentation patterns, we investigated the effect of divergence in phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI) on ruminal community structure of beef cattle across two contrasting diets. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to profile the rumen bacterial population and to quantify the ruminal populations of Entodinium spp., protozoa, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella brevis, the genus Prevotella, and fungi in 14 low (efficient)- and 14 high (inefficient)-RFI animals offered a low-energy, high-forage diet, followed by a high-energy, low-forage diet. Canonical correspondence and Spearman correlation analyses were used to investigate associations between physiological variables and rumen microbial structure and specific microbial populations, respectively. The effect of RFI on bacterial profiles was influenced by diet, with the association between RFI group and PCR-DGGE profiles stronger for the higher forage diet. qPCR showed that Prevotella abundance was higher (P < 0.0001) in inefficient animals. A higher (P < 0.0001) abundance of Entodinium and Prevotella spp. and a lower (P < 0.0001) abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes were observed when animals were offered the low-forage diet. Thus, differences in the ruminal microflora may contribute to host feed efficiency, although this effect may also be modulated by the diet offered.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Effects of essential oils on methane production and fermentation by, and abundance and diversity of, rumen microbial populations.
AB  - Five essential oils (EOs), namely, clove oil (CLO), eucalyptus oil (EUO), garlic  oil (GAO), origanum oil (ORO), and peppermint oil (PEO), were tested in vitro at 3 different doses (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 g/liter) for their effect on methane production, fermentation, and select groups of ruminal microbes, including total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, archaea, and protozoa. All the EOs significantly reduced methane production with increasing doses, with reductions by 34.4%, 17.6%, 42.3%, 87%, and 25.7% for CLO, EUO, GAO, ORO, and PEO, respectively, at 1.0 g/liter compared with the control. However, apparent degradability of dry matter and neutral detergent fiber also decreased linearly with increasing doses by all EOs except GAO. The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids were not affected by GAO, EUO, or PEO but altered linearly and quadratically by CLO and ORO, respectively. All the EOs also differed in altering the molar proportions of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, all the EOs decreased the abundance of archaea, protozoa, and major cellulolytic bacteria (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and R. albus) linearly with increasing EO doses. On the basis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, different EOs changed the composition of both archaeal and bacterial communities to different extents. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was reduced for archaea by all EOs in a dose-dependent manner but increased for bacteria at low and medium doses (0.25 and 0.50 g/liter) for all EOs except ORO. Due to the adverse effects on feed digestion and fermentation at high doses, a single EO may not effectively and practically mitigate methane emission from ruminants unless used at low doses in combinations with other antimethanogenic compounds.
TI  - Microbial population in the rumen of swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as influenced by coconut oil and mangosteen peel supplementation.
AB  - Four, rumen fistulated swamp buffalo bulls were used to study microbial populations in the rumen when supplemented with coconut oil and mangosteen peel. Animals were randomly assigned to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Four treatments were un-supplemented (Control), supplementation with coconut oil at 50 g/kg (CO5), supplementation with mangosteen peel at 30 g/kg (MP3) and supplementation with CO5 and MP3 (COM), of total DM intake. Animals received concentrate at 10 g/kg of BW, and rice straw was given ad libitum. Abundance of total bacteria was increased by CO5 supplementation, whereas populations of protozoa and Fibrobacter succinogenes were reduced by CO5 and COM supplementation. Dietary supplementation did not affect methanogen, Ruminococcus flavefaciens or Ruminococcus albus abundances. Dietary treatments changed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns of methanogens and protozoa when compared with the control group, especially when supplemented with MP3. Supplementation of COM resulted in the greatest difference in pattern of DGGE bands for total bacteria compared with the control. Coconut oil and mangosteen peel supplementation resulted in changing of rumen microbial abundances and communities; however, combination of them could be more benefit to improve rumen fermentation of swamp buffalo fed on rice straw.
TI  - In situ identification of carboxymethyl cellulose-digesting bacteria in the rumen of cattle fed alfalfa or triticale.
AB  - A method was developed and used to arrest and stain reducing sugars (glucose) produced by bacteria with cell-surface-associated carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) and endoglucanase activities (CMC bacteria) in the rumen of cows fed alfalfa or triticale. Precipitation of silver oxide on the surface of individual cells was observed using cellulolytic bacterial pure cultures with known CMCase activity and rumen mixed cultures. The CMC bacteria in the liquid and solid fractions of the rumen digesta were identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with currently available and newly designed oligonucleotide probes. The CMC bacteria contributed between 8.2% and 10.1% to the total bacterial cell numbers. Most of the CMC bacteria (75.2-78.5%) could be identified by FISH probing. The known cellulolytic populations Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes constituted 44.5-53.1% of the total. Other CMC bacteria identified hybridized with the probe Clo549 (11.2-23.0%) targeting members of an uncharacterized genus in Clostridia, the probe Inc852 (8.9-10.7%) targeting members of the family Incertae Sedis III and unclassified Clostridiales, and the probe But1243 (< 1%) designed against members of genus Butyrivibrio. Different forage feeds had no marked effects on the percentage abundances of these identified CMC bacteria. All appeared to be involved in cellulose degradation in the rumen of cows fed either alfalfa or triticale.
TI  - Effects of chestnut tannins and coconut oil on growth performance, methane emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of chestnut tannins (CT) and coconut oil (CO) on growth performance, methane (CH(4)) emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep. A total of 48 Rideau Arcott sheep (average body weight 31.5+/-1.97 kg, 16 wk old) were randomly assigned into 6 treatment groups in a 3 x 2 factorial design, with CT and CO as the main effects (8 sheep per group). The treatments were control diet (CTR), 10 or 30 g of CT/kg of diet (CT10 and CT30), 25 g of CO/kg of concentrate (CO25), and 10 or 30 g of CT/kg of diet+25 g of CO/kg of concentrate (CT10CO25 and CT30CO25). After the feeding trial (60 d), all sheep were moved to respiratory chambers to measure CH(4) emission. After CH(4) emission measurements, all sheep were slaughtered to obtain rumen fluid samples. Results showed that the addition of CT, CO, and CT+CO had no significant effects on growth performance of sheep but reduced CH(4) emission. Addition of CT reduced the NH(3)-N concentration in rumen fluid in CT30. Addition of CO decreased the concentration of total volatile fatty acids in rumen fluid. No significant differences were observed in pH and molar proportion of volatile fatty acids among treatments. Addition of CT, CO, and CT+CO significantly decreased methanogen and protozoa populations. Moreover, CO decreased counts of Fibrobacter succinogenes. No significant differences were observed in populations of fungi, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, or Ruminococcus albus among treatments. In conclusion, supplementation of CT and CO seemed to be a feasible means of decreasing emissions of CH(4) from sheep by reduction of methanogen and protozoa populations with no negative effect on growth performance.
TI  - Responses in digestion, rumen fermentation and microbial populations to inhibition of methane formation by a halogenated methane analogue.
AB  - The effects of the anti-methanogenic compound, bromochloromethane (BCM), on rumen microbial fermentation and ecology were examined in vivo. Japanese goats were fed a diet of 50 % Timothy grass and 50 % concentrate and then sequentially adapted to low, mid and high doses of BCM. The goats were placed into the respiration chambers for analysis of rumen microbial function and methane and H2 production. The levels of methane production were reduced by 5, 71 and 91 %, and H2 production was estimated at 545, 2941 and 3496 mmol/head per d, in response to low, mid and high doses of BCM, respectively, with no effect on maintenance feed intake and digestibility. Real-time PCR quantification of microbial groups showed a significant decrease relative to controls in abundance of methanogens and rumen fungi, whereas there were increases in Prevotella spp. and Fibrobacter succinogenes, a decrease in Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens was unchanged. The numbers of protozoa were also unaffected. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that several Prevotella spp. were the bacteria that increased most in response to BCM treatment. It is concluded that the methane-inhibited rumen adapts to high hydrogen levels by shifting fermentation to propionate via Prevotella spp., but the majority of metabolic hydrogen is expelled as H2 gas.
TI  - Effects of nitrate on methane production, fermentation, and microbial populations in in vitro ruminal cultures.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effects of nitrate on methane production, important fermentation characteristics, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, total bacteria, and methanogens using in vitro ruminal cultures. Potential adaptation of the above microbes and persistency of nitrate to mitigate CH4 production were also evaluated. Methane production was reduced by 70% at 12 mumol ml(-1) and nearly completely at >/=24 mumol ml(-1) nitrate. Production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was affected to different extents at different nitrate concentrations. Over a series of six consecutive cultures receiving 12 mumol ml(-1) nitrate, production of CH4 and VFA did not change significantly. R. albus and R. flavefaciens seemed to adapt to nitrate, while F. succinogenes and methanogens did not. Nitrate may be used in achieving persistent mitigation of CH4 production by ruminants.
TI  - Development of a signature probe targeting the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed  spacer of a ruminal Ruminococcus flavefaciens isolate from reindeer.
AB  - The cellulolytic Ruminococcus flavefaciens has previously been introduced into the ruminant rumen to increase microbial degradation of plant cell wall carbohydrates. The functional effect of an introduced bacterium depends on its ability to establish in the digestive tract, and signature probes can be used as a tool to track and quantify introduced strains. The purpose of this current study was to develop an oligonucleotide signature probe targeting the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of a putative probiotic cellulolytic isolate (R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32) from the rumen of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). The 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS of three Ruminococcus strains; R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32, R. flavefaciens FD-1 and Ruminococcus albus Ra-8, was investigated. The ITS region has been reported to vary more between closely related bacteria compared to the widely used 16S rRNA gene, and a high degree of sequence polymorphism was indeed detected between the three Ruminococcus strains studied. Based on observed sequence differences, two oligonucloetide probes, ITSRumi1 and ITSRumi2, targeting the ITS region of the R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 were developed. Probe specificity was evaluated in dot blot hybridisations with R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 and four other Ruminococcus-strains tested. The probe ITSRumi1 gave positive signals for the R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 only, while probe ITSRumi2 gave positive signals for R. flavefaciens isolate 8/94-32 as well as for R. albus Ra-8. The result of hybridisations with the probe ITSRumi1 indicates that the probe is specific for the R. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32 amongst the four Ruminococcus-strains tested, and is promising for further studies using it as a signature probe for tracking this strain when re-introduced to the reindeer rumen.
TI  - Populations of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen of sheep and  the effect of diets and ruminal fractions.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the importance of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen by quantifying their populations and the effect of diets and ruminal fractions. Full-length 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences were recovered from rumen samples using specific primers designed from partial sequences recovered previously. Five uncultured bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were quantified using specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) in fractionated ruminal samples from sheep fed either hay alone or hay plus corn. Species Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Mitsuokella multacida and genera Butyrivibrio and Prevotella were also quantified as comparison. The full-length rrs sequence improved taxonomic assignments of partial rrs sequences. Genus Prevotella had the greatest abundance. Of the three major cultured cellulolytic species, R. flavefaciens was most abundant, followed by R. albus and F. succinogenes. The five uncultured bacterial OTUs, classified to genus Acetivibrio, genus Allobaculum, family Ruminococcaceae, order Clostridiales, or class Clostridia, had abundance comparable to that of the above species of genera except Prevotella. Corn supplementation and fractions affected distribution of the rumen bacteria, but to a limited extent. When compared to the qPCR data, sequence frequencies in the rrs clone libraries tended to overestimate the abundance of the bacteria represented. This study showed that abundance and population dynamics of uncultured bacteria can be quantified by specific qPCR, which complements the results of rrs clone libraries. This study also revealed that some uncultured bacteria might be as important as some of the well-characterized bacteria in the rumen. The approach used should be applicable to assess the abundance and potential importance of uncultured bacteria in other environments.
TI  - Nutrient digestibility and ruminal fermentation characteristic in swamp buffaloes fed on chemically treated rice straw and urea.
AB  - The experiment was conducted to determine effects of urea-lime-treated rice straw and urea levels in concentrate on rumen fermentation, apparent nutrient digestibility, and cellulolytic bacteria population of 4-year-old, rumen-fistulated swamp buffaloes. All animals were randomly assigned according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments: factor A, two sources of roughage (rice straw and 2%urea + 2%lime-treated rice straw); factor B, two levels of urea in concentrate mixture (0% and 4%). Roughages were given ad libitum together with 0.3% BW of concentrate. It was found that voluntary feed intake, the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, NDF, acetate, and propionate concentration were significantly increased (P < 0.05) by treated rice straw, while NH(3)-N, BUN, and propionic acid concentration were increased by both factors of treated rice straw and 4% urea in concentrate. The real-time PCR quantification of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus population, and anaerobic fungi were greater (P < 0.05), but the population of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, protozoa, and methanogenic bacteria were reduced (P > 0.05) as influenced by treated rice straw and urea level. In conclusion, the combined use of urea-lime-treated rice straw and fed with concentrate (4% urea) could improve rumen ecology, rumen fermentation efficiency, and nutrient digestibility in swamp buffaloes.
TI  - Molecular diversity of bacteria in Yunnan yellow cattle (Bos taurs) from Nujiang  region, China.
AB  - The rumen content of four Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 OTU (Operational Taxonomy Unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. Similarity analysis revealed that Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 12 sequences (10 OTU) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succiniclasticum ruminis, Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and Prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total OTU). The further 12 sequences (9 OTU) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria Clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, Schwartzia succinivorans, Prevotella ruminicola, Eubacterium ruminantium, Ruminococcus albus, and Clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of the total OTU). The remaining 105 sequences (90 OTU) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total OTU). According to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low G+C subdivision (accounting for 72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively) and CFB subdivision (Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively). Among the examined clones, rare bacteria Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Effects of methanogenic inhibitors on methane production and abundances of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria in in vitro ruminal cultures.
AB  - The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of select antimethanogen compounds on methane production, feed digestion and fermentation, and populations of ruminal bacteria and methanogens using in vitro cultures. Seven compounds, including 2-bromoethanesulphonate (BES), propynoic acid (PA), nitroethane (NE), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (ETB), 2-nitroethanol (2NEOH), sodium nitrate (SN), and ethyl-2-butynote (EB), were tested at a final concentration of 12 mM. Ground alfalfa hay was included as the only substrate to simulate daily forage intake. Compared to no-inhibitor controls, PA, 2NEOH, and SN greatly reduced the production of methane (70 to 99%), volatile fatty acids (VFAs; 46 to 66%), acetate (30 to 60%), and propionate (79 to 82%), with 2NEOH reducing the most. EB reduced methane production by 23% without a significant effect on total VFAs, acetate, or propionate. BES significantly reduced the propionate concentration but not the production of methane, total VFAs, or acetate. ETB or NE had no significant effect on any of the above-mentioned measurements. Specific quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assays showed that none of the inhibitors significantly affected total bacterial populations but that they did reduce the Fibrobacter succinogenes population. SN reduced the Ruminococcus albus population, while PA and 2NEOH increased the populations of both R. albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Archaeon-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that all the inhibitors affected the methanogen population structure, while archaeon-specific qPCR revealed a significant decrease in methanogen population in all treatments. These results showed that EB, ETB, NE, and BES can effectively reduce the total population of methanogens but that they reduce methane production to a lesser extent. The results may guide future in vivo studies to develop effective mitigation of methane emission from ruminants.
TI  - Long-term defaunation increases the abundance of cellulolytic ruminococci and methanogens but does not affect the bacterial and methanogen diversity in the rumen of sheep.
AB  - Protozoa are commensal eukaryotes in the rumen of herbivores. Protozoa are large  producers of hydrogen, which is utilized by methanogenic archaea to produce methane, a greenhouse gas. The removal of protozoa from the rumen (defaunation) decreases methanogenesis, but also negatively affects fiber digestion, which is the main function of the rumen. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of long-term defaunation on the structure of the microbiota and particularly methanogenic archaea and fibrolytic bacteria to better understand the microbial mechanisms responsible for the decrease in methanogenesis and fibrolysis. The trial was conducted in 5 adult sheep subjected successively to long-term defaunation (2 yr), refaunation (12 wk), and short-term defaunation (10 wk). Methanogens were enumerated by quantitative PCR targeting the rrs (16S ribosomal RNA subunit) and mcrA (methyl coenzyme-M reductase) genes. The rrs gene was used to quantify the 3 major culturable rumen cellulolytic bacterial species (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and total bacteria. Bacterial and methanogen diversity was also examined by PCR-DGGE (PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis targeting the rrs and mcrA genes, respectively. Total rumen bacterial density estimated as rrs copies per gram of DM of rumen content increased in response to long- and short-term defaunation (+1 log, P < 0.001), but without noticeable shifts in diversity. Defaunation increased the rrs copies per gram of DM of rumen content of R. albus and R. flavefaciens (+2 log, P < 0 0.001), but did not affect that of F. succinogenes. Despite a 20% reduction in methane emission in the 2 defaunated periods, the mcrA and rrs copies of methanogens per gram of DM of rumen content increased (+1 log, P < 0.001) in the absence of protozoa, whereas the diversity of the dominant methanogenic community was not modified. This study shows no major difference between long- and short-term defaunation in abundance and diversity of bacteria and archaea. It also provides evidence that monitoring the abundance and diversity of methanogens is not sufficient to comprehend the microbial mechanisms leading to a reduction in methane emissions by ruminants. This study also reports for the first time in sheep a selective effect of defaunation on the abundance of cellulolytic bacterial species.
TI  - Effect of incremental levels of fish oil supplementation on specific bacterial populations in bovine ruminal fluid.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of incremental replacement of dietary linoleic acid by >20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on changes in population of ruminal micro-organisms associated with fibre digestion and biohydrogenation using real-time PCR of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Four beef steers with ruminal cannulas were randomly assigned to control (CK, 65:35 forage to concentrate), CK with 3% sunflower oil plus 1% fish oil (S3F1), 2.5% sunflower oil plus 1.5% fish oil (S2.5F1.5) or 2% sunflower oil plus 2% fish oil (S2F2) in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-day periods. Ruminal fluid was collected on day 15 of each period. Compared with CK, oil addition led to lower ruminal acetate and butyrate but greater propionate concentration. DNA copy number of Anaerovibrio lipolytica in ruminal fluid was greater with oil (average 5.38 vs. 3.62 x 10(5) DNA copy number), particularly with S2F2 relative to CK. Fibrobacter succinogenes and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens DNA copy number decreased by 74% (1.06 vs. 4.01 x 10(5)) and 39% (5.16 vs. 8.42 x 10(7)) in response to S2F2 compared with CK. DNA copy numbers of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by incremental fish oil. Results suggest that greater availability of PUFA with >20 carbons (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) promoted changes in bacterial populations that are relevant for fibre digestion and biohydrogenation.
TI  - Influence of the composition of the cellulolytic flora on the development of hydrogenotrophic microorganisms, hydrogen utilization, and methane production in the rumens of gnotobiotically reared lambs.
AB  - We investigated the influence of the composition of the fibrolytic microbial community on the development and activities of hydrogen-utilizing microorganisms in the rumens of gnotobiotically reared lambs. Two groups of lambs were reared. The first group was inoculated with Fibrobacter succinogenes, a non-H(2)-producing species, as the main cellulolytic organism, and the second group was inoculated with Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and anaerobic fungi that produce hydrogen. The development of hydrogenotrophic bacterial communities, i.e., acetogens, fumarate and sulfate reducers, was monitored in the absence of methanogens and after inoculation of methanogens. Hydrogen production and utilization and methane production were measured in rumen content samples incubated in vitro in the presence of exogenous hydrogen (supplemented with fumarate or not supplemented with fumarate) or in the presence of ground alfalfa hay as a degradable substrate. Our results show that methane production was clearly reduced when the dominant fibrolytic species was a non-H(2)-producing species, such as Fibrobacter succinogenes, without significantly impairing fiber degradation and fermentations in the rumen. The addition of fumarate to the rumen contents stimulated H(2) utilization only by the ruminal microbiota inoculated with F. succinogenes, suggesting that these communities could play an important role in fumarate reduction in vivo.
TI  - Forage type and fish oil cause shifts in rumen bacterial diversity.
AB  - Despite evidence supporting improved incorporation of beneficial polyunsaturated  fatty acids (PUFA) into ruminant products, such as meat and milk, following red clover and fish oil (FO) inclusion in the ruminant diet, little is known regarding the concomitant bacterial diversity. We evaluated the effects of feeding grass vs. red clover silage with incremental FO inclusion on known lipolytic, biohydrogenating, cellulolytic and proteolytic rumen bacterial communities of steers. Following 14 days of dietary adaptation, liquid-associated (LAB) and solid-associated (SAB) bacterial communities were harvested, DNA extracted and bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and specific-bacterial quantitative PCR (QPCR) were undertaken. DGGE-derived dendrograms showed that diet caused the greatest change in LAB and SAB bacterial diversity, with FO inclusion at the 2% and 3% dry matter intake also causing some changes. QPCR revealed that diet resulted in changes in the DNA concentration of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, the Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. FO inclusion caused changes in A. lipolytica, F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens DNA concentration only. In the B. proteoclasticus group, which are the only known bacteria with the capacity to biohydrogenate PUFA to 18:0, DNA concentration did not correlate to 18:0 flow to the duodenum, however, suggesting that other bacteria may play a role in biohydrogenation. A greater understanding of microbial changes that accompany beneficial dietary changes will lead to novel strategies to improve ruminant product quality.
TI  - Associative effects of supplementing rice straw-based diet with cornstarch on intake, digestion, rumen microbes and growth performance of Huzhou lambs.
AB  - Thirty-six male Hu lambs consuming a rice straw-based diet were used in a 60-day  trial to study the associative effects of cornstarch supplementation on intake, digestion, ruminal microbial population and growth performance. All animals were fed rice straw ad libitum together with 160 g/day of rapeseed meal and supplemented with cornstarch at levels of 0 (control), 60, 120 or 180 g/day, respectively. Increment of supplementary cornstarch showed little influence on rice straw intake. Optimal growth performance and highest apparent digestibility of organic matter was achieved in the 120 g/day cornstarch group (P < 0.05), while the digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein were significantly decreased by 180 g/day cornstarch (P < 0.05). Similar results were observed for carboxymethyl cellulose activity and relative populations of cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogene). Blood urea nitrogen was reduced by supplementary cornstarch, indicating enhanced protein utilization efficiency. Carcass traits were all significantly improved by supplementary cornstarch. These results suggested that proper amounts of starch supplementation (within 0.5% BW) has little adverse effect on forage utilization, but could effectively improve growth performance. High levels of cornstarch, however, would decrease cellulase activity and populations of cellulolytic bacteria, and hence the digestibility of forage.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - Soybean oil and linseed oil supplementation affect profiles of ruminal microorganisms in dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal microorganisms and fermentation parameters due to dietary supplementation of soybean and linseed oil alone or in combination. Four dietary treatments were tested in a Latin square designed experiment using four primiparous rumen-cannulated dairy cows. Treatments were control (C, 60 : 40 forage to concentrate) or C with 4% soybean oil (S), 4% linseed oil (L) or 2% soybean oil plus 2% linseed oil (SL) in a 4 x 4 Latin square with four periods of 21 days. Forage and concentrate mixtures were fed at 0800 and 2000 h daily. Ruminal fluid was collected every 2 h over a 12-h period on day 19 of each experimental period and pH was measured immediately. Samples were prepared for analyses of concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) by GLC and ammonia. Counts of total and individual bacterial groups (cellulolytic, proteolytic, amylolytic bacteria and total viable bacteria) were performed using the roll-tube technique, and protozoa counts were measured via microscopy in ruminal fluid collected at 0, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. Content of ruminal digesta was obtained via the rumen cannula before the morning feeding and used immediately for DNA extraction and quantity of specific bacterial species was obtained using real- time PCR. Ruminal pH did not differ but total VFA (110 v. 105 mmol/l) were lower (P < 0.05) with oil supplementation compared with C. Concentration of ruminal NH3-N (4.4 v. 5.6 mmol/l) was greater (P < 0.05) due to oil compared with C. Compared with C, oil supplementation resulted in lower (P < 0.05) cellulolytic bacteria (3.25 x 108 v. 4.66 x 108 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml) and protozoa (9.04 x 104 v. 12.92 x 104 cell/ml) colony counts. Proteolytic bacteria (7.01 x 108 v. 6.08 x 108 CFU/ml) counts, however, were greater in response to oil compared with C (P < 0.05). Among oil treatments, the amount of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in ruminal fluid was substantially lower (P < 0.05) when L was included. Compared to C, the amount of Ruminococcus albus decreased by an average of 40% regardless of oil level or type. Overall, the results indicate that some ruminal microorganisms, except proteolytic bacteria, are highly susceptible to dietary unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, particularly when linolenic acid rich oils were fed. Dietary oil effects on ruminal fermentation parameters seemed associated with the profile of ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Detection of fiber-digesting bacteria in the ceca of ostrich using specific primer sets.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect three fibrolytic bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus, in the cecal digesta of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) by PCR using a species-specific primer set for each 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA). Although amplified DNA fragments obtained from each primer set had the expected size, the clone library derived from the amplimer contained non-specific sequences. The F. succinogenes-specific primer set recovered a partial 16S rDNA sequence of an uncultivated Fibrobacter with low similarity (<95%) and distantly related phylogenetic positioning to Fibrobacter sequences deposited in the databases, indicating a novel species of Fibrobacter. The sequence was considered to be identical to a clone detected in our previous experiment. Thus, we confirm that the gastrointestinal tract of the ostrich is one of the habitats of Fibrobacter species. The clone library derived from the R. flavefaciens-specific primer set contained a 16S rDNA sequence with 97% similarity to R. flavefaciens, indicating it could be one of a major fibrolytic bacterium in the ostrich ceca. No R. albus 16S rDNA sequence was found in the clone library of the R. albus-specific primer set.
TI  - Ionized calcium requirement of rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Ionized calcium (Ca(+2)) appears to be required by the 3 predominant species of rumen cellulolytic bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. The present study evaluated the role of ionized calcium in growth and cellulose digestion. Maximum growth or rate and extent of digestion and lag time were the criteria used to evaluate Ca(+2) requirements. All cultures except F. succinogenes A3c grew when repeatedly transferred in a medium without added Ca(+2). As Ca(+2) concentration increased in cellobiose medium, the rate of growth increased and lag time decreased for F. succinogenes A3c, whereas F. succinogenes S85 exhibited increases in both maximum growth and rate of growth. No responses in any of the criteria were observed for the ruminococci in cellobiose medium. Both strains of F. succinogenes had an absolute requirement for Ca(+2) with cellulose as the only substrate. For strain A3c the requirement was 0.36 to 0.42 mM and for S85, >0.64 mM. Increases in extent of cellulose degradation occurred with all strains of ruminococci as Ca(+2) concentration increased; however, degradation in Ca(+2)-free medium was similar to that of F. succinogenes with Ca(+2). Although the ruminococci presumably have cellulosomes that require Ca(+2) in their structure, such was not evident in our studies. The function of Ca(+2) in cellulose degradation by F. succinogenes is unknown, but may be related to the secretion or activation of their cellulolytic enzymes. Based on reported concentrations of Ca(+2) in the rumen, it seems unlikely that an in vivo deficiency would occur for these bacteria.
TI  - Use of real-time PCR technique in studying rumen cellulolytic bacteria population as affected by level of roughage in swamp buffalo.
AB  - A real-time polymerase chain reaction approach was used in this study to determine the population of major ruminal bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) in digesta and rumen fluid of swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Four rumen-fistulated, male swamp buffalo were randomly assigned according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design to evaluate the effect of the urea-treated rice straw (roughage source)-to-concentrate ratio on cellulolytic bacterial distribution. Animals were fed roughage-to-concentrate (R:C) ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75, respectively. At the end of each period, rumen fluid and digesta were collected at 0 h and 4 h post-morning-feeding. It was found that feeding urea-treated rice straw solely increased these three cellulolytic bacteria numbers up to 2.65 x 10(9) and 3.54 x 10(9) copies per milliliter for F. succinogenes, 5.10 x 10(7) and 7.40 x 10(7) copies per milliliter for R. flavefaciens, and 4.00 x 10(6) and 6.00 x 10(6) copies per milliliter for R. albus in rumen fluid and digesta, respectively. The distribution of the three cellulolytic bacteria species in digesta were highest at 3.21 x 10(9), 4.55 x 10(7), and 4.56 x 10(6) copies per milliliter for F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, and R. albus, respectively. Moreover, at 4 h post-morning-feeding, the populations of the three cellulolytic bacteria were higher than found at 0 h post-morning-feeding. It is most notable that F. succinogenes were the highest in population in the rumen of swamp buffalo and cellulolytic bacteria mostly adhered to feed digesta in the rumen.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
TI  - Quantification by real-time PCR of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen of sheep after supplementation of a forage diet with readily fermentable carbohydrates: effect of a yeast additive.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of concentrate and yeast additive on the number of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen of sheep. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were quantified using real-time PCR (targeting 16S rDNA) in parallel to cellulolytic flora enumeration with cultural techniques. Whatever the conditions tested, R. flavefaciens was slightly more abundant than F. succinogenes, with both species outnumbering R. albus. Before feeding, the shift from hay to hay plus concentrate diet had no effect on rumen pH and on the number of the three specie; while after feeding, the concentrate-supplemented diet induced a decrease (-1 log) of the number of the three species concomitant with the rumen acidification. Overall, the presence of the live yeast resulted in a significant increase (two- to fourfold) of the Ruminococci. CONCLUSION: The use of real-time PCR allowed us to show changes in the number of cellulolytic bacterial species in vivo in response to diet shift and additives that could not be as easily evidenced by classical microbial methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study contributes to the understanding of the negative impact of readily fermentable carbohydrates on rumen cellulolysis and the beneficial effect of yeast on rumen fermentation.
TI  - Effect of sulfur supplements on cellulolytic rumen micro-organisms and microbial  protein synthesis in cattle fed a high fibre diet.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of sulfur-containing compounds on the growth of anaerobic rumen fungi and the fibrolytic rumen bacteria Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes in pure culture and within the cattle rumen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of two reduced sulfur compounds, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid as the sole S source on growth of pure fibroyltic fungal and bacterial cultures showed that these compounds were capable of sustaining growth. An in vivo trial was then conducted to determine the effect of sulfur supplements (MPA and sodium sulfate) on microbial population dynamics in cattle fed the roughage Dichanthium aristatum. Real-time PCR showed significant increases in fibrolytic bacterial and fungal populations when cattle were supplemented with these compounds. Sulfate supplementation leads to an increase in dry matter intake without a change in whole tract dry matter digestibility. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of low S-containing diets with either sodium sulfate or MPA stimulates microbial growth with an increase in rumen microbial protein supply to the animal. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Through the use of real-time PCR monitoring, a better understanding of the effect of S supplementation on discrete microbial populations within the rumen is provided.
TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Unravelling carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria has been investigated essentially in Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. While cellulose depolymerization into soluble sugars by various cellulases is undoubtedly the first step in bacterial metabolisation of cellulose, it is not the only one to consider. Among anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, C. cellulolyticum has been investigated metabolically the most in the past few years. Summarizing metabolic flux analyses in continuous culture using either cellobiose (a soluble cellodextrin resulting from cellulose hydrolysis) or cellulose (an insoluble biopolymer), this review aims to stress the importance of the insoluble nature of a carbon source on bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, some general and specific traits of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria trends, namely, the importance and benefits of (i) cellodextrins with degree of polymerization higher than 2, (ii) intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage, (iii) glycogen cycling on cell bioenergetics, and (iv) carbon overflows in regulation of carbon metabolism, as well as detrimental effects of (i) soluble sugars and (ii) acidic environment on bacterial growth. Future directions for improving bacterial cellulose degradation are discussed.
TI  - In vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  - The role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. Two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94) were used in vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and ruminal H2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H2:CO2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R. albus (P < 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P < 0.05) produced the most H2 among strains and resulted in greater (P < 0.01) CH4 production when cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P < 0.01). Biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.
TI  - Butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  - High concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. The ability of 22 strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (Ruminococcus albus SY3, Ruminococcus flavefaciens RF1,Prevotella ruminicola AR20) and the ruminal phycomycete Neocallimastix patriciarum CX to digest the tropical grass Heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. Significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the B. fibrisolvens strains H17c, A38, LP92-1-1, 49,R. albus SY3 and N. patriciarum. Hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except B. fibrisolvens strains GS113, OB156 and LP1028 and P. ruminicola AR20. The ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different strains of Butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for AR 51 to 0.16 for A38. Butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (H17c and A38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (LP 91-4-1 and AR 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. Cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when Butyrivibrio spp. strains H17c, A38 and E14 and the Ruminococcus spp. were grown on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with N. patriciarum. This is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus Ruminococcus. The fungus N. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. The study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  - Community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of amplified ribosomal RNA genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. To assess the accuracy of T-RFLP community profiles representing the relative abundance of bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". Template DNA for PCR amplification was generated either by mixing equal quantities of genomic DNA from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to DNA extraction. Pairwise mixtures of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 with Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and Streptococcus bovis JB1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. With genomic DNA mixes, relative abundance calculations based on T-RFLP patterns did not reflect input ratios. These discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rRNA operon copy number. In cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. To determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected PCR product ratios by 6% to 38%. We found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. The unsystematic dependence of T-RFLP peak ratios on variability of DNA extraction and PCR amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of the effects of protozoa on rumen bacteria in cattle.
AB  - A real-time PCR approach was used in this study to clarify the populations of major bacterial species in the rumens of faunated and unfaunated cattle. The sensitivity of this novel real-time PCR assay was evaluated by using 10(1) to 10(8) plasmid copies of target bacteria. The numbers of plasmid copies of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Prevotella ruminicola, and the CUR-E cluster were higher in the unfaunated than in the faunated rumens. The CUR-E cluster belongs to the Clostridium group. In contrast, Fibrobacter succinogenes was higher in the faunated than in the unfaunated rumens. Although it is well known that an absence of protozoa brings about an increase in the bacterial population, it was clarified here that an absence of protozoa exerted differential effects on the populations of cellulolytic bacteria in cattle rumens (i.e., F. succinogenes, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens). In addition, real-time PCR analysis suggested that the CUR-E cluster was more prevalent in the unfaunated rumens.
TI  - The dynamics of major fibrolytic microbes and enzyme activity in the rumen in response to short- and long-term feeding of Sapindus rarak saponins.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the short- and long-term effects of an extract of Sapindus rarak saponins (SE) on the rumen fibrolytic enzyme activity and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two feeding trials were conducted. In the short-term trial, four fistulated goats were fed a basal diet containing sugar cane tops and wheat pollard (65:35, w/w) and were supplemented for 7 days with SE at a level of 0.6 g kg(-1) body weight. Rumen liquor was taken before, during and after SE feeding. In the long-term trial, 28 sheep were fed the same basal diet as the goats and were supplemented for 105 days with 0.24, 0.48 and 0.72 g kg(-1) body mass of the extract. Rumen liquor was taken on days 98 and 100. Protozoal numbers were counted under the microscope. Cell wall degradation was determined by enzyme assays and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms were quantified by dot blot hybridization. Sapindus extract significantly depressed rumen xylanase activity in both trials and carboxymethylcellulase activity in the long-term trial (P < 0.01). Fibrobacter sp. were not affected by the SE in both trials, while ruminococci and the anaerobic fungi showed a short-term response to the application of saponins. Protozoal counts were decreased only in the long-term trial with sheep. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there is an adaptation of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Chytridiomycetes (fungi) to saponin when fed over a long period. The fact that no correlation between the cell wall degrading enzyme activities and the cell wall degrading micro-organisms was observed suggests that the organisms tracked in this experiment are not the only key players in ruminal cell wall degradation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sapindus rarak saponins partially defaunate the rumen flora. Their negative effect on cell wall degradation, however, is not related to rumen organisms currently recognized as the major cell wall degrading species. The adaptation of microbes in the long-term feeding experiment suggests that the results from short-term trial on the ruminal microbial community have to be interpreted carefully.
TI  - Albusin B, a bacteriocin from the ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus albus 7 that inhibits growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - An approximately 32-kDa protein (albusin B) that inhibited growth of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was isolated from culture supernatants of Ruminococcus albus 7. Traditional cloning and gene-walking PCR techniques revealed an open reading frame (albB) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32,168 Da. A BLAST search revealed two homologs of AlbB from the unfinished genome of R. albus 8 and moderate similarity to LlpA, a recently described 30-kDa bacteriocin from Pseudomonas sp. strain BW11M1.
TI  - Solid residues from Ruminococcus cellulose fermentations as components of wood adhesive formulations.
AB  - Residues from the fermentation of cellulose by the anaerobic bacteria Ruminococcus albus (strain 7) or Ruminococcus flavefaciens (strains FD-1 or B34b) containing residual cellulose, bacterial cells and their associated adhesins, were examined for their ability to serve as components of adhesives for plywood fabrication. The residues contained differing amounts of protein (0.4-4.2% of dry weight), but the ratios of monosaccharides recovered following two-stage treatment of the residue with detergent (pH 7) and TFA were similar for all three strains (0.71 glucose:0.18 xylose:0.08 mannose:0.02 galactose), suggesting similarities in exopolysaccharide composition. Three-ply aspen panels prepared with fermentation residues (FR) displayed better shear strength and wood failure under dry conditions than following a vacuum/pressure/soak/dry treatment, but adhesive properties were inferior to those prepared with conventional phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesives. However, panels prepared by incorporating the R. albus 7 FR into PF formulation, at 73% by weight of the total adhesive, exhibited shear strength and wood failure similar to that obtained with PF adhesive alone. Use of residues from fermentations by these bacteria as components of adhesives may add value to biomass fermentations aimed primarily at producing ethanol and other chemical products.
TI  - Kinetics of in sacco fiber-attachment of representative ruminal cellulolytic bacteria monitored by competitive PCR.
AB  - Stems of orchardgrass hay in nylon bags were incubated in the rumens of three ruminally fistulated sheep to monitor the rate and extent of fiber attachment by the representative ruminal cellulolytic bacteria via competitive polymerase chain reaction. After incubation for 5 min, the numbers of Fibrobacter succinogenes and the two ruminococcal species attached to stems were 10(5) and 10(4)/g dry matter (DM) of stem, respectively. At 10 min, the numbers of all three species attached to stems increased 10-fold. Thereafter, attached cell numbers of the three species gradually increased and peaked at 24 h (10(9)/g DM for F. succinogenes and 10(7)/g DM for Ruminococcus flavefaciens) or 48 h (10(6)/g DM for Ruminococcus albus). On the other hand, cell numbers of all three species in the whole digesta were constant over 24 h. Changes in the rate of in sacco neutral detergent fiber disappearance of hay stem, which showed a linear increase up to 96 h, were not synchronized with changes in cellulolytic bacterial mass. These results suggest that sufficient numbers of cells of the three cellulolytic species to move to new plant fragments are present at the start of incubation, the initial attachment to new plant matter is mostly accomplished within 10 min and then bacterial growth and fibrolytic action follow. F. succinogenes was most dominant, both in the whole rumen digesta and on the suspended hay stems, demonstrating the ecological and functional significance of this species in ruminal fiber digestion.
TI  - Supplementation of barley straw with Sesbania pachycarpa leaves in vitro: effects on fermentation variables and rumen microbial population structure quantified by ribosomal RNA-targeted probes.
AB  - Tropical livestock is often maintained on roughage-based diets deficient in N, and therefore requires supplementation with protein-rich substrates to achieve reasonable production levels. The optimum inclusion rate of a potential supplement is usually determined by in vivo feeding trials or by in vitro incubation of the diet components to estimate the feed value of the complete diet. The present work simulates a supplementation experiment in vitro, by incubating a pure roughage (barley straw), a pure supplement (Sesbania pachycarpa leaves) and mixtures of the two, with increasing inclusion levels of the supplement, in a short-term batch incubation system. Fermentation kinetics were followed by the release of fermentation endproducts (gas and short-chain fatty acids). Microbial biomass was estimated using ribosomal (r) RNA as internal marker for bacteria and eukaryotes separately. Cell-wall-degrading subpopulations were quantified by hybridisation with taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes targeting Chytridiomycetes, Fibrobacter spp., Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. Carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) was assayed as an indicator for cell-wall-degrading activity. The addition of S. pachycarpa leaves stimulated fermentation in all cases. Gas production, and especially rRNA concentration, showed clear maxima at 40 % S. pachycarpa inclusion, rates that significantly exceeded the values interpolated from the incubations of the pure substrates. Short-chain fatty acid yield changed only slightly, but in the same way. The analysis of the microbial population structure showed that the positive effects were mainly mediated through enhanced growth of Ruminococcus spp. Increasing proportions of S. pachycarpa leaves in the diet led to a drastic decline in the total eukaryotic population. This points to a defaunation, which may also have added to the positive effects. The eukaryotic subpopulation of the rumen fungi were affected to a lesser degree. Although the cell-wall-degrading organisms showed positive responses to the supplementation, the CMCase activity was not affected significantly by the supplementation. The present work shows that it is possible to predict optimum inclusion levels for a new feed supplement in vitro and thus reduce in vivo experiments. It was also demonstrated that true supplementation effects occur particularly for the microbial biomass production, which is the primary source of amino acids for the ruminant animal. The analysis of microbial population structure in context with conventional metabolic measurements adds valuable information to interpret the observed effects on production-related variables.
TI  - Cereal supplementation modified the fibrolytic activity but not the structure of  the cellulolytic bacterial community associated with rumen solid digesta.
AB  - 4 ruminally cannulated cows were fed a forage diet (93% hay + 7% straw) and a mixed diet (33 % hay + 7% straw + 40% barley) in a 2 x 2 crossover experimental design. In sacco degradation of forage, fibrolytic activities (polysaccharidases and glycosidases) of the solid-associated bacteria (SAB), and distribution of the 3 main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) were determined for both diets. Barley supplementation decreased the hay degradation rate and mainly the polysaccharidase activities of the SAB (30% on average). The sum of rRNA of the 3 cellulolytic bacterial species represented on average 17% of the total bacterial signal and R. albus was the dominant cellulolytic bacterial species of the 3 studied. Barley supplementation did not modify the proportion of the 3 cellulolytic bacteria attached to plant particles. The negative effect of barley on the ruminal hay degradation rate is due to a decrease in fibrolytic activity of the SAB, and not to a modification of the balance of the three cellulolytic bacterial species examined.
TI  - A comparison of enzymatic and molecular approaches to characterize the cellulolytic microbial ecosystems of the rumen and the cecum.
AB  - We used RNA probes and enzyme activities to compare the cellulolytic microbial ecosystems of the rumen and the cecum. Four rumen- and cecum-cannulated wethers were fed a diet of barley plus hay (60:40). Digesta samples were collected 1 h before feeding and 3, 6, and 9 h after feeding for measurements on microbial populations, and 1 h before feeding and 3 and 6 h after feeding for digestion measurements, pH, and VFA. Polysaccharidase and glycosidase specific activities of solid-adherent microorganisms were measured respectively by the amount of reducing sugars released from xylan or avicel or p-nitrophenol from the p-nitrophenol derivatives of xylose and glucose. The distribution and amounts of the three main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) were determined by dot-blot hybridization using specific 16SrRNA-targeting probes. Enzyme activities were higher in the rumen than in the cecum and before feeding than at 3 h after feeding. The sum of the three cellulolytic bacterial species represented, on average, 4.5% of the total bacterial RNA in the two compartments and did not vary with sampling time. The cellulolytic bacterial community structure was different in the two compartments, with F. succinogenes as the main species in the rumen and R. flavefaciens in the cecum. The lower cellulolytic activity in the cecum than in the rumen could not be ascribed to any difference in the structure of the cellulolytic bacterial community between these two compartments, and other hypotheses related to digestion are proposed.
TI  - Development and use of competitive PCR assays for the rumen cellulolytic bacteria: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - Competitive PCR assays were developed for the enumeration of the rumen cellulolytic bacterial species: Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. The assays, targeting species-specific regions of 16S rDNA, were evaluated using DNA from pure culture and rumen digesta spiked with the relevant cellulolytic species. Minimum detection levels for F. succinogenes, R. albus and R. flavefaciens were 1-10 cells in pure culture and 10(3-4) cells per ml in mixed culture. The assays were reproducible and 11-13% inter- and intra-assay variations were observed. Enumeration of the cellulolytic species in the rumen and alimentary tract of sheep found F. succinogenes dominant (10(7) per ml of rumen digesta) compared to the Ruminococcus spp. (10(4-6) per ml). The population size of the three species did not change after the proportion of dietary alfalfa hay was increased. All three species were detected in the rumen, omasum, caecum, colon and rectum. Numbers of the cellulolytic species at these sites varied within and between animals.
TI  - Fibrolytic activities and cellulolytic bacterial community structure in the solid and liquid phases of rumen contents.
AB  - Four sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet. Rumen content samples were collected three hours after feeding in order to total microorganism population (TP), solid attached population (SAP) and solid attached firmly population (SAFP). Fibrolytic specific activities (xylanase, CMCase and beta-glycosidases) were estimated by the amount of reducing sugars or p-nitrophenol released from the appropriate substrate. The distribution of the three main cellulolytic bacterial species (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) was quantified by dot-blot hybridisation using specific 16S-rRNA-targeting probes. Specific activities of polysaccharidase enzymes were higher in SAP than in TP, and in SAFP than in SAP. The sum of RNA of the three cellulolytic bacterial species represented on average 9% of the total bacterial RNA, and increased after filtration. In all samples, the relative population size of F. succinogenes was higher than that of R. albus and of R. flavefaciens. These results demonstrate that the most active enzymes are secreted by the particle-associated microorganisms. The differences in composition of the microflora between the solid and liquid phase suggest that bacteria are not equally distributed throughout the rumen content: the cellulolytic species are present in a higher proportion in the solid phase of rumen contents.
TI  - Invited review: adhesion mechanisms of rumen cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - We divided the adhesion process of the predominant cellulolytic rumen bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus into four phases: 1) transport of the nonmotile bacteria to the substrate; 2) initial nonspecific adhesion of bacteria to unprotected sites of the substrate that is dominated by constitutive elements of bacterial glycocalyx; 3) specific adhesion via adhesins or ligands formation with the substrate, which can be dominated by several bacterial organelles including cellulosome complexes, fimbriae connections, glycosylated epitopes of cellulose-binding protein (CBP) or glycocalyx, and cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of enzymes; 4) proliferation of the attached bacteria on potentially digestible tissues of the substrate. Each of the phases and its significance in the adhesion process are described. Factors affecting bacterial adhesion are described including: 1) factors related to bacterial age, glycocalyx condition, and microbial competition; 2) factors related to the nature of substrate including, cuticle protection, surface area, hydration, and ionic charge; and 3) environmental factors including pH, temperature, and presence of cations and soluble carbohydrate. Based on the information available from the literature, it appears that each of the predominant rumen bacteria--F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, and R. albus--has a specific mechanism of adhesion to cellulose. In F. succinogenes, both the glycosidic residues of the outer membrane CBP and especially of the 180-kDa CBP, and the distinct CBD of EG2 EGF and Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, may play a role in the adhesion to cellulose. No direct evidence, except scanning electron microscopy observations, yet supports the existence of either cellulosome complex or fimbriae structures involved in the adhesion mechanism of F. succinogenes. At least two mechanisms, cellulosome-like complexes and carbohydrate epitopes of the glycocalyx layer are involved in the specific adhesion of R. flavefaciens to cellulose. Ruminococcus albus possesses at least two mechanisms for specific adhesion to cellulose: a cellulosomal-like mechanism, and a CbpC (Pil)-protein mechanism that probably involves the production of fimbrial-like structures. Indirect and direct studies suggested that carbohydrate epitopes of CBPs and CBD epitope of cellulases may also be involved mostly in the nonspecific phase of adhesion of R. albus.
TI  - Incorporation of [(15)N] ammonia by the cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes BL2, Ruminococcus albus SY3, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.
AB  - The origin of cell nitrogen and amino acid nitrogen during growth of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in different growth media was investigated by using (15)NH(3). At high concentrations of peptides (Trypticase, 10 g/liter) and amino acids (15.5 g/liter), significant amounts of cell nitrogen of Fibrobacter succinogenes BL2 (51%), Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 (43%), and Ruminococcus albus SY3 (46%) were derived from non-NH(3)-N. With peptides at 1 g/liter, a mean of 80% of cell nitrogen was from NH(3). More cell nitrogen was formed from NH(3) during growth on cellobiose compared with growth on cellulose in all media. Phenylalanine was essential for F. succinogenes, and its (15)N enrichment declined more than that of other amino acids in all species when amino acids were added to the medium.
TI  - Competition among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in the absence  or presence of non-cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Competition among three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria - Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and Ruminococcus albus 7 - was studied in the presence or absence of the non-cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Selenomonas ruminantium or Streptococcus bovis. Co-cultures were grown under either batch or continuous conditions and populations were estimated using species-specific oligonucleotide probes to 16S rRNA. The three cellulolytic species co-existed in cellobiose batch co-culture, but inclusion of either Sel. ruminantium or Str. bovis yielded nearly a monoculture of the non-cellulolytic competitor. In cellobiose chemostats, R. albus completely dominated the triculture, but R. flavefaciens became predominant over F. succinogenes and R. albus when Sel. ruminantium was co-inoculated into the chemostats. Similar effects on competition were observed in the presence of Str. bovis at a lower (0.021 h(-1)), but not at a higher (0.045 h(-1)) dilution rate. In cellulose batch co-cultures, R. albus was more abundant than both F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens, regardless of the presence of the non-cellulolytic species. Co-existence among the three cellulolytic species was observed in almost all cellulose chemostats, but Sel. ruminantium altered the relative proportions of the cellulolytic species. R. albus and R. flavefaciens were found to produce inhibitors that suppressed growth of R. flavefaciens and F. succinogenes, respectively. These data indicate that interactions among cellulolytic bacteria, while complex, can be modified further by non-cellulolytic species.
TI  - The effect of a methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, on the growth rate, organic acid production, and specific ATP activity of three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Three predominant ruminal cellulolytic organisms, Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 8, and R. flavefaciens FD-1, were cultured with a methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii. Growth rates, bacterial protein, organic acids, and methane production were measured. When grown in diculture with the methanogen, a fermentative advantage was observed with F. succinogenes S85 as seen by an increase in specific rate of ATP production and organic acid concentration. The introduction of the methanogen did not improve the growth rate, organic acid yield, or specific rate of ATP production for R. albus 8. The growth rate and amount of organic acid end products increased when R. flavefaciens FD-1 was cultured with the methanogen; however, the specific activity of ATP production did not increase.
TI  - Effect of steroidal saponin from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  - The effects of steroidal saponins (SAP) isolated from Yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. Prevotella bryantii, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg SAP ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). The four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to SAP, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves were determined. The cellulolytic ruminal bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on Whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram SAP ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. The ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to SAP. Steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of Strep. bovis (P < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), P. bryantii (P < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and Rb. amylophilus (P < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of S. ruminantium was enhanced (P < 0.05) at 10, 14 and 24 h. The growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (P > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total SAP and soluble (deglycosylated) SAP in the liquid fraction were unchanged (P > 0.05) over time. Steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but F. succinogenes was less (P < 0.05) sensitive to SAP and more (P < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating SAP than were Rc. flavefaciens or Rc. albus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that SAP altered the cell walls of the SAP-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. The ruminal fungi, Neocallimastix frontalis and Piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram SAP ml-1. Filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram SAP ml-1. Steroidal saponins from Y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. As such, SAP may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.
TI  - Use of 16S-rRNA Based Techniques to Investigate the Ecological Succession of Microbial Populations in the Immature Lamb Rumen: Tracking of a Specific Strain of Inoculated Ruminococcus and Interactions with Other Microbial Populations in Vivo.
AB  - The establishment of microorganisms in the rumen is a critical step if rumen manipulation is to be accomplished by use of microbial inoculants. Microbial populations in the maturing rumen undergo successional changes and, while in a state of flux, provide a possible opportunity for the introduction of specific strains of bacteria. While the rumen of the young lamb was maturing, we measured changes in several microbial populations with 16S-rRNA specific oligonucleotides: Rumincoccus, Fibrobacter, eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, the Bacteroides-Porphromonas-Prevotella group, and anaerobic rumen fungi. In this study we repeatedly dosed 15 lambs with approximately 3.4 x 10(8) to 0.8 x 10(9) Ruminococcus cells dose(-1), twice a week, for 7 wk from 23 d to 63 d of age. Of the five Ruminococcus strains dosed (R. albus SY3 and AR67, and R. flavefaciens Y1, LP9155, and AR72) the most specific primers (based on 16S rDNA) were obtained for strain SY3. There was an increase in the eukaryotic population during dosing, and it was hypothesized that protozoal predation contributed to the disappearance of strain SY3. At the end of dosing PCR amplification showed that SY3 were approximately 10(9) cells ml(-1), but decreased to below the detection limit of the PCR system (8.6 x 10(4) ml(-1)) within 28 d postdosing. These experiments showed that fibrolytic populations increased significantly (P < 0.1) above the controls during the dosing period and were elevated for several days postdosing. This suggests that dosing of highly fibrolytic bacteria makes more of the fiber available to other organisms able to degrade fiber, and in so doing increases the overall fibrolytic activity of the rumen. Examination of the succession of gram-positive bacteria and the Bacteroides-Porphromonas-Prevotella group showed a decline in relative abundance as the lambs matured.
TI  - Feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. Recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. The problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. When the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. Recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast RNA was 100.6+/-3.2%. Purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, D16f, H10b, and H17c; Fibrobacter succinogenes B21a; Lachnospira multiparus D25e; Lactobacillus lactis ARD26e; Prevotella ruminicola H15a; Ruminococcus albus 7; Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b; and Streptococcus bovis ARD5d. The CV for the most-probable-number (MPN) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. Considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. More consistent values were obtained when these components were expressed on a dry matter basis. Purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. For samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. The value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. Based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. Limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which results in lower purine:protein ratios.
TI  - 16S rDNA sequencing of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens: design of a signature probe and its application in adult sheep.
AB  - The ruminococci are an important group of fibrolytic bacteria inhabiting the rumen. Seventeen strains of presumptively identified Ruminococcus were evaluated by a combination of nearly complete and partial 16S rDNA sequence that identified all strains as either Ruminococcus albus or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. All sequences fell into cluster IV of the clostridia, while other species of ruminococci (e.g. Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus lactaris) fall into cluster XIVa of the clostridia. Ruminococcus cluster IV sequences were used to design a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe to assess the relative abundance of target populations in a stable ruminal environment. A stable population (animals fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to diurnal rumen fluctuations. The steady state populations were sampled six times over a 24 d period and direct microscopic counts (DC), total culturable counts (TCC), and total cellulolytic counts (CEL) were determined. DC and culturable data (TCC and CEL) were compared with relative abundance estimates of Ruminococcus IV and Fibrobacter succinogenes. A combination of the Ruminococcus and F. succinogenes probes accounted for 4.0% of the bacterial population and cellulolytic bacteria (measured by most-probable numbers) were 5.2% of the total culturable count. These data suggest that a major portion of the Ruminococcus and Fibrobacter diversity has been cultured and is represented by available sequences. Steady state populations were measured over several days in three sheep and an estimate of variation in DC, TCC, CEL and 16S-based data were obtained. These variance estimates could be used to determine the theoretical sample sizes required to obtain statistically significant differences under different experimental conditions.
TI  - Identification of Ruminococcus flavefaciens as the predominant cellulolytic bacterial species of the equine cecum.
AB  - Detection and quantification of cellulolytic bacteria with oligonucleotide probes showed that Ruminococcus flavefaciens was the predominant species in the pony and donkey cecum. Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus were present at low levels. Four isolates, morphologically resembling R. flavefaciens, differed from ruminal strains by their carbohydrate utilization and their end products of cellobiose fermentation.
TI  - Effect of diet on populations of three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - The effects of four contrasting diets were determined on populations of three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes) using oligonucleotide probes to rRNA. Diets based on alfalfa silage or corn silage as the primary fiber source were formulated to contain either 24 or 32% neutral detergent fiber measured after alpha-amylase treatment. The diets were fed twice daily to four ruminally fistulated, lactating Holstein cows in a trial using a Latin square design. The cows fed the alfalfa silage diets had higher dry matter intakes and milk production and smaller pH fluctuations than did cows fed the corn silage diets (0.3 vs. 0.8 units). The total populations of the three cellulolytic species at 3 h after feeding ranged from 0.3 to 3.9% of the bacterial domain; R. albus was generally the most abundant of the three species. The data are in general agreement with population assessments obtained by some traditional methods of culture enumeration. Although diet and individual cows had major effects on ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid concentrations and on milk production and composition, differences in cellulolytic populations that were attributable to individual cows were larger than those attributable to diet, suggesting that each cow maintained a unique assemblage of cellulolytic species.
TI  - [Cellulosolytic bacteria of the genus Ruminococcus from cattle rumen].
AB  - Fifty-eight strains of cellulolytic cocci were isolated from the rumen of cows bred at different farms. These cultures were referred to Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Investigation of the rate of cellulose hydrolysis showed that the ruminococci were heterogeneous with respect to this parameter and could be classified into high-, medium-, and low-activity strains, hydrolyzing substrate in 50, 60-80, and 100 h, respectively. This rate was shown to be directly related (r = 0.69) to the capacity of ruminococci to adhere to the substrate.
TI  - A cysteine desulphurase gene from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - A gene whose predicted product shows 40-50% sequence identity with the products of nifS genes from nitrogen-fixing bacteria was found downstream from a cellulase gene in a DNA fragment from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe, Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17. The R. flavefaciens gene product released sulphur from l-cysteine when expressed in Escherichia coli, indicating that the R. flavefaciens NifS enzyme may play a role in sulphuration, perhaps, as in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, supplying sulphur to FeS proteins. Sequences hybridising with the R. flavefaciens 17 nifS-like gene were also detected in R. flavefaciens 007 and in R. albus SY3.
TI  - Microbial perspective on fiber utilization by swine.
AB  - Dietary fiber may contribute up to 30% of the maintenance energy needs of growing pigs. Higher energy contributions may be obtained from dietary fiber fed to sows, along with some improvements in reproduction, health, and well-being. As long as cereal grain supplies and high-quality protein supplements are abundant, the use of fibrous feeds for swine most likely will be limited. However, as the human demand for cereal grains increases, swine producers, especially those with reproductive animals, may be economically forced to incorporate alternative feedstuffs. These feedstuffs might include lignified plant cell wall material such as grasses and legumes, and feed-milling and distillery by-products that contain a high level of fiber residues. The microflora in swine large intestine will be able to adapt to these lignified forages and by-product feeds much better than the microflora in humans. Swine microflora contain highly active ruminal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacterial species, which include Fibrobacter succinogenes (intestinalis), Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio spp., and Prevotella ruminicola. Additionally, a new highly active cellulolytic bacterium, Clostridium herbivorans, has been recently isolated from pig large intestine. The populations of these microorganisms are known to increase in response to the ingestion of diets high in plant cell wall material. The numbers of cellulolytic bacteria from adult animals are approximately 6.7 times greater than those found in growing pigs. None of these highly active cellulolytic bacterial species are found in the human large intestine. Thus, the pig large intestinal fermentation of fiber seems to more closely resemble that of ruminants than that of humans.
TI  - Effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae culture on ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) culture on lactate utilization and cellulose digestion by ruminal bacteria. Growth of Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 in medium that contained 5 g/L of DL-lactate, Trypticase, and yeast extract was stimulated 7 and 15% by 1 and 5% (vol/vol) yeast culture filtrate respectively. The 1 and 5% yeast culture filtrate stimulated growth of Selenomonas ruminantium H18 and Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and T81 on 5 g/L of DL-lactate in medium without Trypticase or yeast extract. Growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and Ruminococcus albus B199 on 6 g/L of cellobiose was stimulated by the addition of yeast culture filtrate to medium without Trypticase or yeast extract. The yeast culture filtrate increased the concentrations of acetate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by Sel. ruminantium HD4 and increased the concentrations of propionate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by Sel. ruminantium H18 but did not alter end-product formation of M. elsdenii or cellulolytic bacteria. Treatment with yeast culture increased the initial rate but not the extent of cellulose digestion by F. succinogenes S85 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1. Collectively, these results suggest that yeast culture provides soluble growth factors (i.e., organic acids, B vitamins, and amino acids) that stimulate growth of ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
TI  - PCR detection of Ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faecal samples.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures for Ruminococcus spp. were developed and used for the detection of Ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faeces. The PCR specificity was established for Ruminococcus albus, R. bromii, R. obeum, R. callidus and R. flavefaciens. The PCR sensitivity ranged from 4 to 100 cells of the pure cultures, depending on the species. Ruminococcus albus, R. bromii, R. obeum and R. callidus were detected in human faeces. R. bromii, R. albus and R. obeum were also detected in animal faeces. R. flavefaciens was not detected in most of the samples tested, except for a weak positive in monkey faecal specimens. The PCR appears to be a specific and efficient method for the detection of Ruminococcus spp. in faecal specimens.
TI  - Competition between ruminal cellulolytic bacteria for adhesion to cellulose.
AB  - Competition for adhesion to cellulose among the three main ruminal cellulolytic bacterial species was studied using differential radiolabeling (14C/3H) of cells. When added simultaneously to cellulose, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1 and Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 showed some competition; however, both species were surpassed competitively by Ruminococcus albus 20. When R. flavefaciens FD1 and F. succinogenes S85 were already adherent, R. albus 20 adhesion occurred without inhibition but involved R. flavefaciens FD1 detachment.
TI  - Competition for cellobiose among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria  under substrate-excess and substrate-limited conditions.
AB  - The ruminal cellulolytic bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and Fibrobacter  succinogenes S85 coexisted in substrate-excess coculture with about equal population size, but R. flavefaciens outcompeted F. succinogenes for cellobiose in the substrate-limited cocultures whether the two strains were coinoculated or a steady-state culture of F. succinogenes was challenged by R. flavefaciens. This outcome of competition between these two strains is due to a classical pure and simple competition mechanism based on affinity for cellobiose. Although the population size of F. succinogenes was much higher (> 70%) than that of another cellulolytic species, Ruminococcus albus 7 in substrate-excess coculture, F. succinogenes was replaced by a population of R. albus in the substrate-limited coculture in both coinoculation and challenge experiments. R albus outcompeted F. succinogenes, apparently due to selection in the chemostat of a population of R. albus with a higher affinity for cellobiose. R. albus also outcompeted R. flavefaciens under substrate-limited conditions.
TI  - Competition for cellulose among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria under substrate-excess and substrate-limited conditions.
AB  - Three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and Ruminococcus albus 7) were grown in different binary combinations to determine the outcome of competition in either cellulose-excess batch culture or in cellulose-limited continuous culture. Relative populations of each species were estimated by using signature membrane-associated fatty acids and/or 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. Both F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens coexisted in cellulose-excess batch culture with similar population sizes (58 and 42%, respectively; standard error, 12%). By contrast, under cellulose limitation R. flavefaciens predominated (> 96% of total cell mass) in coculture with F. succinogenes, regardless of whether the two strains were inoculated simultaneously or whether R. flavefaciens was inoculated into an established culture of F. succinogenes. The predominance of R. flavefaciens over F. succinogenes under cellulose limitation is in accord with the former's more rapid adherence to cellulose and its higher affinity for cellodextrin products of cellulose hydrolysis. In batch cocultures of F. succinogenes and R. albus, the populations of the two species were similar. However, under cellulose limitation, F. succinogenes was the predominant strain (approximately 80% of cell mass) in cultures simultaneously coinoculated with R. albus. The results from batch cocultures of R. flavefaciens and R. albus were not consistent within or among trials: some experiments yielded monocultures of R. albus (suggesting production of an inhibitory agent by R. albus), while others contained substantial populations of both species. Under cellulose limitation, R. flavefaciens predominated over R. albus (85 and 15%, respectively), as would be expected by the former's greater adherence to cellulose. The retention of R. albus in the cellulose-limited coculture may result from a combination of its ability to utilize glucose (which is not utilizable by R. flavefaciens), its demonstrated ability to adapt under selective pressure in the chemostat to utilization of lower concentrations of cellobiose, a major product of cellulose hydrolysis, and its possible production of an inhibitory agent.
TI  - Why don't ruminal bacteria digest cellulose faster?
AB  - The bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus generally are regarded as the predominant cellulolytic microbes in the rumen. Comparison of available data from the literature reveals that these bacteria are the most actively cellulolytic of all mesophilic organisms described to date from any habitat. In light of numerous proposals to improve microbial cellulose digestion in ruminants, it is instructive to examine the characteristics of these species that contribute to their superior cellulolytic capabilities and to identify the factors that prevent them from digesting cellulose even more rapidly. As a group, these species have extreme nutritional specialization. They are able to utilize cellulose (or in some cases xylan) and its hydrolytic products as their nearly sole energy sources for growth. Moreover, each species apparently has evolved to similar maximum rates of cellulose digestion (first-order rate constants of 0.05 to 0.08 h-1). Active cellulose digestion involves adherence of cells to the fibers via a glycoprotein glycocalyx, which protects cells from protozoal grazing and cellulolytic enzymes from degradation by ruminal proteases while it retains-at least temporarily-the cellodextrin products for use by the cellulolytic bacteria. These properties result in different ecological roles for the adherent and nonadherent populations of each species, but overall provide an enormous selective advantage to these cellulolytic bacteria in the ruminal environment. However, major constraints to cellulose digestion are caused by cell-wall structure of the plant (matrix interactions among wall biopolymers and low substrate surface area) and by limited penetration of the nonmotile cellulolytic microbes into the cell lumen. Because of these constraints and the highly adapted nature of cellulose digestion by the predominant cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen, transfer of cellulolytic capabilities to noncellulolytic ruminal bacteria (e.g., by genetic engineering) that display other desirable properties offers limited opportunities to improve ruminal digestion of cellulose.
TI  - Utilization of individual cellodextrins by three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  - Growth of the ruminal bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and R. albus 7 followed Monod kinetics with respect to concentrations of individual pure cellodextrins (cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and cellohexaose). Under the conditions tested, R. flavefaciens FD-1 possesses the greatest capacity to compete for low concentrations of these cellodextrins.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
TI  - Response to various amounts of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on ruminal metabolism in cattle.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract stimulated or inhibited ruminal fermentation when fed at higher than recommended doses (3 g/d). Four dietary treatments of A. oryzae fermentation extract were fed daily to six cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. For each of four periods, bromegrass hay (6% CP) with and without extract was fed for 28 d. Dacron bags containing bromegrass cell walls were ruminally incubated to determine ruminal fiber degradation. The A. oryzae fermentation extract did not affect degradation of cell walls, cellulose, or hemicellulose. Total ruminal anaerobic or cellulolytic bacteria were not different among treatments; neither were the proportions of cellulolytic species, Butyrivibrio sp., Ruminococcus albus, or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Ruminal ammonia was not different; however, total VFA were higher, and pH tended to be lower, when 27 g/d of A. oryzae fermentation extract was fed. The proportion of VFA was not different among treatments. The A. oryzae fermentation extract fed at nine times the recommended dosage did not produce any stimulatory effects, except for total VFA, and was not inhibitory or toxic to ruminal metabolism and forage fiber degradation.
TI  - The use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: pure-culture studies with cellulose and alkaline peroxide-treated wheat straw.
AB  - Specific oligonucleotide probes targeted to sites on the 16S rRNA of Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, and Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 and a domain Bacteria probe were used to study bacterial interactions during the fermentation of cellulose and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw in monocultures, dicultures, and tricultures. Results showed that R. albus 8 inhibited the growth of R. flavefaciens FD-1 when grown as a diculture with cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw as the carbon source. In dicultures containing R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85 grown on cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw, competition was not detected. R. flavefaciens FD-1 outcompeted F. succinogenes S85 when cellulose was used as the carbon source. In tricultures with cellulose as the carbon source, R. flavefaciens FD-1 was inhibited, R. albus 8 appeared to dominate during the early phase of degradation (12 to 48 h), while F. succinogenes S85 became predominant during the later phase of degradation (60 to 70 h). When alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw was used as a growth substrate, F. succinogenes S85 showed better growth than either R. albus 8 or R. flavefaciens FD-1. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 was present in small numbers throughout the incubation period, unlike the growth patterns when cellulose was the carbon source.
TI  - The use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: development of probes for Ruminococcus species and evidence for bacteriocin production.
AB  - A total of six oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the 16S rRNA, were evaluated for quantitative and determinative studies of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. On the basis of specificity studies, probes for R. albus (probe RAL196) and R. flavefaciens (probe RFL196) were selected to quantitate these species in mixed culture. In combination with a Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 subspecies probe (SUB1) and a domain Bacteria (formerly kingdom Eubacteria) probe (EUB338), they were used to quantitate these species competing in mixed cultures for cellobiose as the carbon source. In dicultures containing R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85, competition was not observed. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 eventually outcompeted F. succinogenes S85 when cellobiose was the substrate. When R. albus 8 and R. flavefaciens FD-1 were grown together on cellobiose medium, R. albus 8 outcompeted R. flavefaciens FD-1, resulting in undetectable R. flavefaciens 16S rRNA only 1 to 3 h after inoculation, suggesting production of an antagonistic compound by R. albus 8 during rapid growth on soluble substrates. Further, when R. albus 8, R. flavefaciens FD-1, and F. succinogenes S85 were grown together in a triculture, R. flavefaciens FD-1 16S rRNA was detectable for only 2 h after inoculation, while R. albus 8 and F. succinogenes S85 showed a similar competition pattern to that of the dicultures. The results show that the Ruminococcus probes were effective in the measurement of relative populations of selected R. albus and R. flavefaciens strains during in vitro competition studies with F. succinogenes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The inhibition of fungal cellulolysis by cell-free preparations from ruminococci.
AB  - The degradation of filter paper by the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis  strain RE1 was reduced by the addition of cell-free supernates from cultures of Ruminococcus albus strain J6 and R. flavefaciens strains 17 and 007. Fungal uptake of, and growth on, glucose was not affected. After gel permeation and anion exchange chromatography, inhibitory activity towards fungal cellulolysis was recovered in a fraction from strain 17 that contained at least five negatively charged polypeptide components, molecular mass 45-68 kDa, on SDS-PAGE.
TI  - Partial characterization of a DNA restriction endonuclease from Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 and its inhibition by site-specific adenine methylation.
AB  - The principal DNA restriction-modification system of the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 is described. The restriction endonuclease RflFI could be separated from cell extracts by phosphocellulose and heparin-sepharose chromatography. Restriction enzyme digests utilizing RflFI alone or in combination with SalI, a restriction enzyme isolated from Streptomyces albus G, showed that the DNA sequence recognized by RflFI either overlapped or was the same as that recognized by SalI. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that RflFI was identical in activity to SalI, with the recognition sequence being 5'-GTCGAC-3' and cleavage occurring between G and T. Adenine methylation within this sequence can be catalyzed in vitro by TaqI methylase, and this inhibited the cleavage of plasmid DNA molecules by RflFI and SalI. Chromosomal DNA from R. flavefaciens FD-1 is also methylated within this DNA sequence because neither restriction endonuclease could degrade this DNA substrate. These findings provide a means to protect plasmid molecules from degradation prior to gene transfer experiments with R. flavefaciens FD-1.
TI  - Sequence of a cellulase gene from the rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.
AB  - A cellulase gene (endA) was isolated from a library of Ruminococcus flavefaciens  strain 17 DNA fragments inserted in pUC13. The endA product showed activity against acid-swollen cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, lichenan, cellopentaose and cellotetraose, but showed no activity against cellotriose or binding to avicel. Nucleotide sequencing indicated an encoded product of 455 amino acids which showed significant sequence similarity (ranging from 56% to 61%) with three endoglucanases from Ruminococcus albus, and with Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase E. Little relatedness was found with a cellodextrinase previously isolated from R. flavefaciens FD1.
TI  - The hydrolysis of lucerne cell-wall monosaccharide components by monocultures or  pair combinations of defined ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The defined ruminal bacterial strains Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus  flavefaciens FD1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, and Bacteroides ruminicola GA33 were grown, in monocultures or as combinations of pair strains, on isolated lucerne cell-walls (CW) as the sole carbohydrate substrate. Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was the dominant strain determining extent of CW hydrolysis in all combinations with S85. The hydrolysis of cellulose, xylan, hemicellulose side-sugars, and total CW monosaccharides by pure S85 were: 58.8, 47.3, 66.9 and 57.0%, respectively. The strains combination S85 plus D1 comprised the highest complementary effect, increasing significantly the hydrolysis of cellulose and total CW monosaccharides by 16% and 13%, respectively, above the values obtained by pure S85. This complementation was expressed also in growth pattern of bacteria. The monocultures of FD1, D1 and GA33 had very little hydrolytic effect on lucerne cellulose, but higher effects on xylan and hemicellulose side-sugars. The combinations D1 plus GA33 and 7 plus GA33 were complementary in the hydrolysis of all CW polysaccharides. The combinations FD1 plus D1, FD1 plus GA33, and 7 plus D1 were complementary only with respect to hemicellulose hydrolysis. On the other hand, the cellulolytic combinations S85 plus FD1, S85 plus 7 and FD1 plus 7 demonstrated negative interactions in lucerne CW polysaccharides hydrolysis. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), S85 comprised the most dense layer of bacterial cell mass attached to and colonized on CW particles. The cell surface topology of the cellulolytic strains S85, FD1 and 7 attached to CW particles was specified by a coat of characteristic protuberant structures.
TI  - Degradation of wheat straw and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw by  Ruminococcus albus 8 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
AB  - Degradation of wheat straw (WS) and alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP)-treated wheat straw (AHPWS) by Ruminococcus albus 8 and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was determined by measuring the growth (OD600) of each bacterium and determining DM disappearance (DMD) of the substrate. Complex medium and defined medium with or without the addition of phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA) were used. Tubes were incubated at 39 degrees C for 8 d. Both OD600 and DMD indicated that AHPWS was degraded to a much greater extent by either bacterium (R. flavefaciens FD-1, 60.8 +/- 1.8% and R. albus 8, 42.3 +/- 3.5%) vs untreated WS (R. flavefaciens FD-1, 16.5 +/- 1.8% and R. albus 8, 8.6 +/- 6%) in the complex medium. Most degradation occurred between d 1 and 4. With the complex medium, addition of PPA and PAA did not stimulate degradation by either bacterium. When the defined medium was used, the addition of PPA and PAA enhanced (P less than .05) degradation of AHPWS (39.6 +/- 2.6%) vs AHPWS with no added PPA and PAA (24.9 +/- 7.6%) by R. albus 8. There was no synergistic effect on degradation when the two species were co-cultured with either WS or AHPWS as the substrate. No effect of PPA and PAA on disappearance of AHPWS was observed for R. flavefaciens FD-1 or when the two bacteria were grown together. Dry matter disappearance analysis showed that R. flavefaciens FD-1 degraded AHPWS more rapidly (6.1 mg/d) than R. albus 8 did (4.2 mg/d) in complex medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. The total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x 10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7) to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. The genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of Entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of Diplodiniinae was higher (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. Bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (P less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). This was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic Butyrivibrio isolates. The numbers of Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although R. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. In vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (P less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. The concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and extrachromosomal DNA content of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - Seventeen Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens strains have been screened for naturally occurring antibiotic resistance, as determined by zones of inhibition from antibiotic disks. These strains were also examined for extrachromosomal DNA content. All strains screened are resistant to low levels (10-200 micrograms/mL) of streptomycin. In contrast to the previously reported data, we have found that R. flavefaciens C-94 is now susceptible to both kanamycin and tetracycline. However, R. flavefaciens FD-1 is not susceptible to kanamycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 40 micrograms/mL). Furthermore, R. albus 8 is resistant to tetracycline (MIC = 40 micrograms/mL), and erythromycin (MIC = 100 micrograms/mL). Six freshly isolated strains showed resistance to tetracycline (35-70 micrograms/mL), and all tetracycline-resistant strains also showed resistance to minocycline. None of these Ruminococcus determinants share homology with the streptococcal tetL, tetM, or tetN determinants. All 17 strains were screened for extrachromosomal DNA content. Nine different techniques for the detection and isolation of extrachromosomal DNA were tested. However, owing to difficulties in demonstrating or isolating plasmid DNA, it has not been possible to determine if these antibiotic resistance genes are plasmid borne. Evidence is presented to suggest that the presence of oxygen may affect the quality of the DNA obtained from Ruminococcus.
TI  - Fermentation of xylans by Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria (6 species, 18 strains) to ferment a crude xylan from wheat straw or to ferment xylans from larchwood or oat spelts was studied. Liquid cultures were monitored for carbohydrate utilization, cell growth (protein), and fermentation acid production. B. fibrisolvens 49, H17c, AcTF2, and D1 grew almost as well on one or more of the xylans as they did on cellobiose-maltose. B. fibrisolvens 12, R28, A38, X10C34, ARD22a, and X6C61 exhibited moderate growth on xylans. Partial fermentation of xylans was observed with Bacteroides ruminicola B14, Bacteroides succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94 and FD1, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 22B. All xylans tested appeared to have a small fraction of carbohydrate that supported low levels of growth of nonxylanolytic strains such as Selenomonas ruminantium HD4. Compared to growth on hexoses, the same array of fermentation acids was produced upon growth on xylans for most strains; however, reduced lactate levels were observed for B. fibrisolvens 49 and Selenomonas ruminantium HD4. Measurements of enzyme activities of B. fibrisolvens AcTF2, 49, H17c, and D1 indicated that the xylobiase activities were cell associated and that the xylanase activities were predominantly associated with the culture fluid. The pattern of expression of these enzymes varied both between strains and between the carbon sources on which the strains were grown.
TI  - Effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mM). The growth of Eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of Streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. The MICs of the ionophores for strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. High concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of Bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of Selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. Increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mM) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mM). The data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.
TI  - Electron microscopic study of the methylcellulose-mediated detachment of cellulolytic rumen bacteria from cellulose fibers.
AB  - The presence of methylcellulose prevents the attachment of cellulolytic rumen bacteria to cellulose fibers. The addition of methylcellulose to pure cultures of these organisms in which the cells are already adherent to cellulose causes their detachment from this insoluble substrate and the inhibition of their growth. Methylcellulose is not used as a carbon source by these organisms and has no effect on their growth when glucose and cellobiose are the carbon sources. Attached cells of Bacteroides succinogenes orient themselves in the plane of the individual cellulose fibers and their methylcellulose-induced detachment, which is complete (almost 100%), leaves grooves where the cellulose has been digested. Attached cells of Ruminococcus albus colonize the cellulose in a looser and less regular pattern and their almost complete methylcellulose-induced detachment leaves less regular pits in the cellulose surface. On the other hand, attached cells of Ruminococcus flavefaciens colonize the cellulose surface in a random orientation by means of a discernible exopolysaccharide network, and their less complete methylcellulose-induced detachment leaves no residual impressions on the cellulose surface. These data support the suggestion that bacterial attachment is necessary for the digestion of highly ordered crystalline cellulose, and that cellulolytic species differ in the nature of their attachment to this insoluble substrate and in the nature of their enzymatic attack. Methylcellulose is an effective agent for detaching major rumen cellulolytic bacteria from their cellulosic substrate.
TI  - Effect of phenolic monomers on ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Ruminal bacteria were subjected to a series of phenolic compounds in various concentrations to acquire fundamental information on the influence on growth and the potential limits to forage utilization by phenolic monomers. Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Lachnospira multiparus D-32 were tested against 1, 5, and 10 mM concentrations of sinapic acid, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and hydrocinnamic acid. Responses were variable and dependent on the phenolic compound and microbial species. Compounds especially toxic (i.e., resulting in poor growth, effect on several species, dose-related response) were p-coumaric acid and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and adaptation to the toxins did not occur after three 24-h periods. Syringic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and hydrocinnamic acids stimulated growth of all four species and also stimulated filter paper degradation by R. flavefaciens. None of the stimulatory compounds supported microbial growth in the absence of carbohydrates. In vitro dry matter digestibility of cellulose (Solka-Floc) was not stimulated by any of the phenolic compounds (10 mM), but the cinnamic acids and benzoic aldehydes (10 mM) reduced (P less than 0.05) digestion by the mixed population in ruminal fluid. Growth of R. flavefaciens in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (10 mM) or p-coumaric acid (5 mM) resulted in recognizable alterations in cell ultrastructure. Both phenolics caused a reduction in cell size (P less than 0.05), and p-coumaric acid caused a reduction in capsular size (P less than 0.05) and produced occasional pleomorphic cells.
TI  - Influence of forage phenolics on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria and in vitro fiber degradation.
AB  - In vitro cultures of ruminal microorganisms were used to determine the effect of  cinnamic acid and vanillin on the digestibility of cellulose and xylan. Cinnamic acid and vanillin depressed in vitro dry matter disappearance of cellulose 14 and 49%, respectively, when rumen fluid was the inoculum. The number of viable Bacteroides succinogenes cells, the predominant cellulolytic organism, was threefold higher for fermentations which contained vanillin than for control fermentations. When xylan replaced cellulose as the substrate, a 14% decrease in the digestibility of xylan was observed with vanillin added; however, the number of viable xylanolytic bacteria cultured from the batch fermentation was 10-fold greater than that of control fermentations. The doubling time of B. succinogenes was increased from 2.32 to 2.58 h when vanillin was added to cellobiose medium, and absorbance was one-half that of controls after 18 h. The growth rate of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens was inhibited more by p-coumaric acid than by vanillin, although no reduction of final absorbance was observed in their growth cycles. Vanillin, and to a lesser extent cinnamic acid, appeared to prevent the attachment of B. succinogenes cells to cellulose particles, but did not affect dissociation of cells from the particles. B. succinogenes, R. albus, R. flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens all modified the parent monomers cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin, with B. fibrisolvens causing the most extensive modification. These results suggest that phenolic monomers can inhibit digestibility of cellulose and xylan, possibly by influencing attachment of the fibrolytic microorganisms to fiber particles. The reduced bacterial attachment to structural carbohydrates in the presence of vanillin may generate more free-floating fibrolytic organisms, thus giving a deceptively higher viable count.
TI  - Effect of 3-phenylpropanoic Acid on growth of and cellulose utilization by cellulolytic ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The growth of several cellulolytic species of ruminal bacteria was measured in media containing either cellobiose or cellulose as the energy source and with or without added 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PPA). With Ruminoccoccus albus 7 and 8, the addition of PPA greatly enhanced the rate of cellulose utilization but had little effect on the rate of growth when cellobiose was the energy source. Comparative rates of growth obtained on either cellobiose or cellulose for Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD1 or C94 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 12, 49, or A38 were similar regardless of the PPA content of the growth medium.
TI  - Degradation of bermuda and orchard grass by species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Fiber degradation in Bermuda grass and orchard grass was evaluated gravimetrically and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy after incubation with pure cultures of rumen bacteria. Lachnospira multiparus D-32 was unable to degrade plant cell wall components. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 degraded 6 and 14.9% of the fiber components in Bermuda grass and orchard grass, respectively, and Ruminococcus albus 7 degraded 11.4% orchard grass fiber but none in Bermuda grass. Both B. fibrisolvens and R. albus lacked capsules, did not adhere to fiber, and degraded only portions of the more easily available plant cell walls. R. flavefaciens FD-1 was the most active fiber digester, degrading 8.2 and 55.3% of Bermuda and orchard grass fiber, respectively. The microbe had a distinct capsule and adhered to fiber, especially that which is slowly degraded, but was able to cause erosion and disorganization of the more easily digested cell walls, apparently by extracellular enzymes. Results indicated that more digestible cell walls could be partially degraded by enzymes disassociated from cellulolytic and noncellulolytic bacteria, and data were consistent with the hypothesis that the more slowly degraded plant walls required attachment. Microbial species as well as the cell wall architecture influenced the physical association with and digestion of plant fiber.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - A metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. To standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees C was generally less than 10 micrograms X mL-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and Streptococcus bovis Pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. In general, the Gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the Gram positive. The minimum inhibitory concentration for Bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms X mL-1; for B. ruminicola GA33 (glucose), B. succinogenes S85 (cellobiose), and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram X mL-1. When added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms X mL-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by B. succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, and R. flavefaciens FD1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms X mL-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. In the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of ammonia treatment on the solubilization of straw and the growth of  cellulolytic rumen bacteria.
AB  - Pre-treatment of straw with anhydrous ammonia increased its susceptibility to solubilization by the predominant cellulolytic bacteria from the rumen, Bacteroides succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens. Ammonia treatment also increased the production of microbial protein and fermentation products by all three species. Scanning electron microscope observations of straw during digestion suggested that the attack of straw by these bacteria was accompanied by the formation of substantial numbers of adherent microcolonies.
TI  - Microtus species as new herbivorous laboratory animals: reproduction; bacterial flora and fermentation in the digestive tracts; and nutritional physiology.
AB  - In a study of the possible introduction of Japanese field vole (Microtus montebelli ) and Hungarian voles (M. arvalis) as herbivorous experimental animals, the following biological characteristics were investigated: breeding and reproductive performance; bacterial flora and fermentation in the digestive tracts; and nutritional physiology. The animals are polyestrus , show postpartum estrus on the day of parturition, and there is little or no delay in implantation due to lactation, especially in M. arvalis. On examination of vaginal smears, Japanese field vole did not show any definite pattern, whereas most Hungarian voles showed 6- to 18- day cycles. From the esophageal sac of voles fed rations with a high fiber content, cellulolytic bacteria similar to Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens , and Bacteroides succinogenes were isolated. More than 1 000 000/g anaerobic bacteria were present in the esophageal sac and the pattern and the types of bacteria resembled those found in the rumen. Gastric fermentation took place in the esophageal sac. The pH and total VFAs were much smaller in the fundic and pyloric regions of the stomach than in the esophageal sac. Acetic and lactic acids were the major fermentation products in the esophageal sac. Following deficiency or lowering of the cellulose decomposing abilities, a decrease of VFAs and an increase in lactic acid production in the esophageal sac were observed. These effects resulted in high glucose, FFA and ketone bodies in the blood, and a higher incidence of glucosuria. Diabetes induced by administrations of drugs such as alloxan, streptozotocin and phloridzin were compared using Microtus and mice. Microtus had low sensitivity to alloxan but high sensitivity to streptozotocin. The influence of monensin on Microtus was also investigated by using diets containing 20 and 80 mg/kg monensin. Diets containing 80 mg/kg monensin led to 50 % mortality in 7 weeks and growth was hindered. Gas production from the esophageal sac contents of voles in the monensin-medicated group was much smaller than that of the non-medicated group. In the monensin group the total VFA concentrations of the esophageal sac contents was decreased.
TI  - Effect of soluble carbohydrates on digestion of cellulose by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - The rate of cellulose digestion in the presence of either glucose or cellobiose was studied for the three predominant species of cellulolytic rumen bacteria: Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Bacteroides succinogenes. When a soluble carbohydrate was added to cellulose broth, the lag phase of cellulose digestion was shortened. Presumably, this was due to greater numbers of bacteria, because increasing the size of the inoculum had a similar effect. Cellulose digestion occurred simultaneously with utilization of the soluble carbohydrate. The rate of cellulose digestion slowed markedly for B. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens and slowed less for R. albus after the cellobiose or glucose had been utilized, and was accompanied by a decrease in pH. Both the rate and the extent of cellulose digestion were partially inhibited when the initial pH of the medium was 6.3 or below. R. albus appeared to be less affected by a low-pH medium than were B. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens. When a soluble carbohydrate was added to the fermentation during the maximum-rate phase of cellulose digestion, the rate of cellulose digestion was not affected until after the soluble carbohydrate had been depleted and the pH had decreased markedly. Prolonged exposure of the bacteria to a low pH had little if any effect on their subsequent ability to digest cellulose. Cellulase activity of intact bacterial cells appeared to be constitutive in nature for these three species of rumen bacteria.
TI  - Influence of plant phenolic acids on growth and cellulolytic activity of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Isolated rumen bacteria were examined for growth and, where appropriate, for their ability to degrade cellulose in the presence of the hydroxycinnamic acids trans-p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid and the hydroxybenzoic acids vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Ferulic and p-coumaric acids proved to be the most toxic of the acids examined and suppressed the growth of the cellulolytic strains Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Bacteroides succinogenes when included in a simple sugars medium at concentrations of >5 mM. The extent of cellulose digestion by R. flavefaciens and B. succinogenes but not R. albus was also substantially reduced. Examination of rumen fluid from sheep maintained on dried grass containing 0.51% phenolic acids showed the presence of phloretic acid (0.1 mM) and 3-methoxyphloretic acid (trace) produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric and ferulic acids, respectively. The parent acids were found in trace amounts only, although they represented the major phenolic acids ingested. Phloretic and 3-methoxyphloretic acids proved to be considerably less toxic than their parent acids. All of the cellulolytic strains (and Streptococcus bovis) showed at least a limited ability to hydrogenate hydroxycinnamic acids, with Ruminococcus spp. proving the most effective. No further modification of hydroxycinnamic acids was produced by the single strains of bacteria examined. However, a considerable shortfall in the recovery of added phenolic acids was noted in media inoculated with rumen fluid. It is suggested that hydrogenation may serve to protect cellulolytic strains from hydroxycinnamic acids.
TI  - Effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB  - Lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium cellulosolvens, E. ruminantium, Lachnospira multiparus, Lactobacillus ruminis, L. vitulinus, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis). Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. Among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (Bacteroides, Selenomonas, Succinimonas, Succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Also, none of the major lactate fermenters (Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, Selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. Veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. Hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. Lasalocid and monensin appeared to inhibit selectively the production of L(+), but not D(-) lactic acid. The inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus and Lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants.
TI  - Effect of pH on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  - A total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Lactobacillus vitulinus GA1, Bacteroides ruminicola B14, B. ruminicola GA33, Ruminococcus albus 7, Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94, and Bacteroides succinogenes S85, were grown in energy-limiteH of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 pH units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and pH were determined. A low pH appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. Large variations were seen among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower pH values and in the pH at which the culture washed out. Lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of pH on the efficiency of protein synthesis in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.
TI  - Molybdate and sulfide inhibit H2 and increase formate production from glucose by  Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - H2 production from glucose by Ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) M molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. Inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. Extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. Active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. The results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form H2 are used to reduce CO2 to formate. Growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) M. Reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of H2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M molybdate. H2 production by R. bromei but not by R. flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Veillonella alcalescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
TI  - Effect of monensin and lasalocid-sodium on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria.
AB  - It is thought that monensin increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. We studied the effect of monensin and the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (Hoffman-LaRoche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Growth of Bacteroides succinogenes and Bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Populations of B. succinogenes and B. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 mug of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth in the presence of each drug at 5.0 mug/ml. Selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. Either antibiotic (10 mug/ml) inhibited Methanobacterium MOH, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanosarcina barkeri MS. Methanobacterium ruminantium PS was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or 20 mug of lasalocid per ml. The methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin but sensitive to 10 mug of lasalocid per ml. The results suggest that monensin or lasalocid acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming Bacteroides and for S. ruminantium, a propionate producer that decarboxylates succinate to propionate. The selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. Selection against H(2) and formate producers, e.g. R. albus, R. flavefaciens, and B. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen.
TI  - Cellulolytic cocci isolated from the cecum of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).
AB  - Five strains of anaerobic, gram-variable cellulolytic cocci, belonging to the genus Ruminococcus, were isolated from the cecum of a guinea pig. They differed from most previously described strains of cellulolytic ruminococci as follows. (i) Lactate was the major fermentation product; lesser amounts of formate and ethanol and a trace of succinate were also produced, along with an uptake of acetate. (ii) No growth occurred at 30 degrees C; however, good growth was observed at 38 and 45 degrees C, (iii) Glucose, cellobiose, cellulose, xylose, arabinose, xylan, sucrose, and lactose were fermented by all strains. Rumen fluid was required for growth in a complete medium containing all nutrients previously found to be required by species in this genus. Limited growth occurred when rumen fluid was replaced by yeast extract, and maximum, but delayed, growth occurred when a water extract of alfalfa was added to the complete medium. No qualitative differences were found in the cell wall amino acids and sugar composition of these strains as compared to Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus; however, cell walls of the guinea pig strains appeared to contain a higher proportion of glucose.
TI  - Studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: Bacteroides clostridiiformis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Enbacterium limosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Clostridium pasteurianum and Escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. Hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. All species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only C. pasteurianum, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii produced hydrogen from dithionite. All species except E. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but activity was low or absent in extracts of E. limosum, F. necrophorum, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. Hydrogen was produced from formate only by E. coli, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, F. necrophorum, and R. flavefaciens. Extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. The hydrogenase of all species except E. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. Treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with DEAE-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. Activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. It is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
TI  - Fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H10b and D16f, Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and D31d, Lachnospira multiparus D15d, Peptostreptococcus sp. D43e, B. succinogenes A3c, Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b, and R. albus 7). Only three strains, 23, D16f, and D31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except A3c and H10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. Nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. Pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. For bromegrass I, all strains tested (B34b, 23, D16f, D31d, D15d, and D43e) degraded a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of B34b, utilized most of what was degraded. Similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass II, except for the two strains of B. ruminicola, 23 and D31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. All strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and D31d. Synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, B34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, D31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. Similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains B34b and D16f; however, no increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
TI  - Carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  - The carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. Increasing concentrations of CO(2) were added as NaHCO(3) to a specially prepared CO(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. Prior depletion of CO(2) in the inoculum was found to affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. An absolute requirement for CO(2) was observed for eight strains of Bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains of Lachnospira multiparus, one strain of Succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Inconsistent growth responses were obtained in CO(2)-free media with one strain each of B. fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus albus, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Growth of six additional strains of B. fibrisolvens, and single strains of Eubacterium ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of CO(2). Peptostreptococcus elsdenii B159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for CO(2). Higher concentrations of CO(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end products.
TI  - Volatile fatty acid requirements of cellulolytic rumen bacteria.
AB  - A gas chromatographic method was developed which could separate the isomers isovaleric and 2-methylbutyric acid. Subsequent analyses revealed that most commercially available samples of these acids were cross-contaminated; however, one sample of each acid was found to be pure by this criterion. The growth response of seven strains of cellulolytic rumen bacteria (three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, three strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and one strain of R. albus) to additions of isobutyric, isovaleric, 2-methylbutyric, valeric, and combinations of valeric and a branched-chain acid was determined. Strains of B. succinogenes required a combination of valeric plus either isobutyric or 2-methylbutyric acid. Isovaleric acid was completely inactive. Either isobutyric or 2-methylbutyric acid was required for the growth of R. albus 7. Strain C-94 of R. flavefaciens grew slowly in the presence of any one of the three branched-chain acids, but a combination of isobutyric and 2-methylbutyric acids appeared to satisfy this organism's growth requirements. None of the individual acids or mixtures of straight- and branched-chain acids allowed growth of R. flavefaciens strain C1a which would approach the response obtained from the total mixture of acids. Further work indicated that all three branched-chain acids were required for optimal growth by this strain, although isovaleric acid only influenced the rate of maximal growth. Either 2-methylbutyric or isovaleric acid allowed growth of nearly the same magnitude as that of the positive control for R. flavefaciens B34b. The presence of acetic acid had little influence on the rate or extent of growth of any of the strains except R. albus 7, for which the extent of growth was markedly increased. Determination of the quantitative fatty acid requirements for the three B. succinogenes strains indicated that 0.1 mumole of valeric per ml and 0.05 mumole of 2-methylbutyric per ml permitted maximal growth. However, with isobutyric acid as the branched-chain component, strains A3c and B21a required 0.1 mumole/ml in contrast to S-85 which exhibited optimal growth at the 0.05 mumole/ml level. By use of mixtures of isobutyric and 2-methylbutyric acids, good growth of C-94 was obtained at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.01 mumole/ml, respectively. About 0.3 mumole/ml of each acid was required for satisfactory growth of C1a.
TI  - Enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  - Joyner, A. E., Jr. (University of California, Davis), and R. L. Baldwin. Enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-The activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. The effects of diet upon the activities of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. In the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, R. albus, Bacteroides succinogenes, B. ruminicola, B. amylophilus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium. Some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase). The cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. Enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
TI  - DEGRADATION AND UTILIZATION OF ISOLATED HEMICELLULOSE BY PURE CULTURES OF CELLULOLYTIC RUMEN BACTERIA.
AB  - Dehority, B. A. (Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station, Wooster). Degradation and  utilization of isolated hemicellulose by pure cultures of cellulolytic rumen bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 89:1515-1520. 1965.-Hemicelluloses isolated from flax, corn hulls, alfalfa, oat hulls, and fescue grass were used as sole energy sources to study the ability of pure cultures of cellulolytic rumen bacteria to degrade and utilize these materials. From a total of eight bacterial strains tested (three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and one strain of Ruminococcus albus), only three strains of ruminococci were able to utilize the hemicelluloses for growth. Hemicellulose fermentation mixtures were analyzed for total pentose, residual hemicellulose (pentose precipitated in 80% ethyl alcohol), and ethyl alcohol-soluble pentose. The three strains of ruminococci were able to partially utilize the different hemicelluloses as energy sources, as determined by total pentose loss, and they were capable of almost complete degradation of the original hemicellulose from an ethyl alcohol-insoluble to ethyl alcohol-soluble form. The extent of both degradation and utilization varied markedly between the three strains and different substrates. Tests on the other strains indicated that no growth, production of organic acid end products, or appreciable loss of total pentose had occurred. However, analysis of the culture medium for residual hemicellulose indicated that these strains were able to extensively degrade the original hemicelluloses to an ethyl alcohol-soluble form. Marked differences were observed among strains and hemicelluloses in the amount of hemicellulose degraded. Of the different hemicelluloses, corn-hull hemicellulose was the most resistant to degradation and utilization by the cellulolytic rumen bacteria.

AB  - Allison, M. J. (Dairy Cattle Research Branch, USDA, Beltsville, Md.), M. P. Bryant, I. Katz, and M. Keeney. Metabolic function of branched-chain volatile fatty acids, growth factors for ruminococci. II. Biosynthesis of higher branched-chain fatty acids and aldehydes. J. Bacteriol. 83:1084-1093. 1962.-A number of strains of rumen bacteria require branched-chain volatile fatty acids for growth. A strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens that requires either isovalerate or isobutyrate incorporates radioactive carbon from isovalerate-1-C(14) and isovalerate-3-C(14) into leucine and into the lipid fraction of the cells. Evidence obtained by both paper and gas chromatography indicated that most of the label in the lipid of cells grown in isovalerate-1-C(14) was in a branched-chain 15-carbon fatty acid, with some in a 17-carbon acid; about 7.5% of the C(14) was recovered in a branched-chain 15-carbon aldehyde. The aldehydes were in the phospholipid fraction and were presumably present as plasmalogen.A strain of R. albus was shown to require isobutyrate, 2-methyl-n-butyrate, or 2-ketoisovalerate for growth. This strain did not incorporate appreciable C(14) from isovalerate-1-C(14) or isovalerate-3-C(14). When grown in a medium containing isobutyrate-1-C(14), most of the cellular C(14) was found in the lipid fraction. Analysis of the lipid demonstrated that the label was present mainly as branched-chain 14-carbon and 16-carbon fatty acids, with 11% of the C(14) present in 14- and 16-carbon carbonyl compounds, presumably branched-chain aldehydes.Branched-chain 14-, 15-, and 16-carbon fatty acids are major components of the lipids of these rumen bacteria. The possibility that these acids and aldehydes, which are found in ruminant body and milk lipids, may be of microbial origin is discussed.
