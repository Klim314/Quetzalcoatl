TI  == a novel combinatorial biocatalytic approach for producing antibacterial compounds effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb).
AB  == two bacterial hosts expressing cloned aromatic oxygenases were used to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of indole and related substrates, creating mixtures of indigoid compounds comprised of novel dimers and trimers. crude extracts and purified compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms, in general, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb), in particular. of the 74 compounds tested against m. tuberculosis, ~66 % had minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 5 mug/ml or less. the most effective antibiotic found was designated sab-p1, a heterodimer of indole and anthranil, which had a mic of 0.16 mug/ml, and did not inhibit kidney cells (ic(50)) at concentrations of >8 mug/ml. combinatorial biocatalysis was used to create a series of halogenated derivatives of sab-p1 with a wider therapeutic window. none of the derivatives had mic values that were superior to sab-p1, but  some had a wider therapeutic window because of decreased kidney cell toxicity. generally, the indigoid dimers that were effective against tb appeared to be specific for tb. some of the trimers generated, however, had a broader spectrum of activity inhibiting not only tb (mic = 1.1 mug/ml) but also the growth of mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis 168, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the structure of two of the novel dimers (sab-c4 and sab-p1) and  a trimer (sab-r1) were solved using x-ray crystallography.

TI  == genetic modifications and introduction of heterologous pdc genes in enterococcus  faecalis for its use in production of bioethanol.
AB  == genetically-modified enterococcus faecalis has a potential of survival and can be used in ethanolic fermentations. fermentation profiles of e. faecalis jh2-2 were  assessed using glucose and lactose as carbon sources. deletion of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) genes increased the ethanol production from 0.25 to 0.82 g/l, which was further increased to 0.96 g/l by the insertion of a pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) gene (from sarcina ventriculi or clostridium acetobutylicum)  in place ldh1. when grown on lactose, the pdcsv and pdcca showed 13.6 and 17.6 u  mg(-1) of pdc specific activity, respectively. highest activity (47 u mg(-1)) and ethanol concentration (2.3 g/l) were obtained with pdcca using an expression plasmid. formate and acetate were also produced in high quantities. transcriptional analysis showed that aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase gene was upregulated up to 16-fold. further optimizations are required for higher ethanol  production.

TI  == catabolism of branched-chain alpha-keto acids in enterococcus faecalis: the bkd gene cluster, enzymes, and metabolic route.
AB  == genes encoding a branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase from enterococcus faecalis 10c1, e1alpha (bkda), e1beta (bkdb), e2 (bkdc), and e3 (bkdd), were found to reside in the gene cluster ptb-buk-bkddabc. the predicted products of ptb and buk exhibited significant homology to the phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase, respectively, from clostridium acetobutylicum. activity and redox properties of the purified recombinant enzyme encoded by bkdd indicate that e. faecalis has a lipoamide dehydrogenase that is distinct from the lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. specific activity of the ptb gene product expressed in escherichia coli was highest with the substrates valeryl-coenzyme a (coa), isovaleryl-coa, and isobutyryl-coa. in cultures, a stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproate to isovalerate was observed, with a concomitant increase in biomass. we propose that alpha-ketoisocaproate is converted via the bkdh complex to isovaleryl-coa and subsequently converted into isovalerate via the combined actions of the ptb and buk gene products with the concomitant phosphorylation of adp. in contrast, an e. faecalis bkd mutant constructed by disruption of the bkda gene did not benefit from having alpha-ketoisocaproate in the growth medium, and conversion to isovalerate was less than 2% of the wild-type conversion. it is concluded that the bkd gene cluster encodes the enzymes that constitute a catabolic pathway for  branched-chain alpha-keto acids that was previously unidentified in e. faecalis.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == isolation of a degeneration-resistant mutant of clostridium acetobutylicum ncimb  8052.
AB  == unless periodically grown from germinated spores, clostridium acetobutylicum tends to degenerate (that is, to spontaneously lose the capacity both to produce  solvents and to develop into spores). to obtain mutants that are deficient in degeneration, c. acetobutylicum ncimb 8052 was mated with enterococcus faecalis bm4110 harboring transposon tn1545. we developed a degeneration resistance assay  based on a secondary effect of degeneration, the production of toxic levels of acetic and butyric acids. erythromycin-resistant transconjugant clones were tested individually for longevity by repeated and timely subculturing. one long-lived mutant, a10, survived 18 +/- 3 transfers (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 20) before extinction, while the wild type (parental cells) survived 6.6 +/-  1.5 transfers (n = 11). the three-fold difference in longevity is statistically significant. in a batch culture in a rich medium, the wild-type cells degenerated within 24 h after inoculation with 1% of an overnight culture derived from germinated spores. in contrast, a10 cells were able to switch to solventogenesis  and to sporulate. in a minimal medium with greater buffering capacity, both cell  types produced solvents and spores. southern blots of ecori and hindiii restriction digests of a10 chromosomal dna (but not parental dna) showed that only one copy of tn1545 was inserted into the clostridial chromosome. our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there was an alteration at a regulatory locus that was effected by the insertion of the transposon.

TI  == vector construction, transformation, and gene amplification in clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824.
AB  == in order to alter the primary metabolism of c. acetobutylicum, we have constructed e. coli- or b. subtilis-c. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors that could  be used to deliver homologous fermentative genes into c. acetobutylicum atcc 824. the plasmid copy number and plasmid stability in c. acetobutylicum for several of these plasmids were determined. we have also developed a protocol for the electrotransformation of c. acetobutylicum atcc 824. difficulty in the transformation of c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 with vectors containing dna from e.  coli plasmids was found to be due to the existence of a restriction system in this strain. this type ii restriction endonuclease, named cac824i, recognizes the sequence 5'-gcngc-3' and cuts cole1 plasmids frequently. one of the vectors, pfnk1, possessing a variety of unique cloning sites was used in the amplification of one acid (ptb) and one solvent (aadc) formation gene. the corresponding enzyme activities were amplified in c. acetobutylicum as shown by enzyme assays and sds-page gels of cell extracts.

TI  == natural transfer of conjugative transposon tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the conjugative streptococcal transposon tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for alcaligenes eutrophus, citrobacter freundii, and escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). no transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. mating of an e. coli strain carrying tn916 yielded transconjugants with bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. the results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially  contributing to bacterial evolution.

TI  == conjugative plasmid transfer from escherichia coli to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the conjugation mechanism of incp plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. this strategy has been adapted for use with the gram-positive anaerobe, clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pam beta 1 (enterococcus faecalis), pcb101 (clostridium butyricum) or pwv01 (streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting orit region of rk2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this  organism. one of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of is1. conjugative mobilization of plasmids from e. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.

TI  == transfer of tn1545 and tn916 to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == tn1545, a conjugative transposon originally discovered in streptococcus pneumoniae, has been transferred from enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis to clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. transfer between different strains of c. acetobutylicum has also been observed. insertion of tn1545 into the c. acetobutylicum chromosome occurred at multiple sites, as shown by southern hybridization. although ermam (erythromycin-resistance) was the most satisfactory marker for primary selection of transconjugants, all three tn1545-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (apha-3, ermam, and tetm) were apparently expressed in c. acetobutylicum. our results indicate that tn1545 is potentially useful for  undertaking mutagenesis and mutational cloning in this industrially important organism. transfer of another conjugative transposon, tn916, from e. faecalis to  c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 was also apparently detected. circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a hot spot for tn916 insertion in the c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 chromosome.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance from streptococci to  clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == three broad host-range mls plasmids, pam beta 1 (em), pip501 (em, cm) and pjh4 (em, sm, km), were transferred by a conjugation-like process from streptococcus faecalis to clostridium acetobutylicum. the plasmids were stably maintained and antibiotic resistances were fully expressed in c. acetobutylicum, except for chloramphenicol resistance, which was poorly expressed, if at all. the c. acetobutylicum strains harbouring every plasmid could be used as donors in intraspecific matings with frequencies of approximately 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-6).
