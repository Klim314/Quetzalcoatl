TI  == expression and activity of a novel cathelicidin from domestic cats.
AB  == cathelicidins are small cationic antimicrobial peptides found in many species including primates, mammals, marsupials, birds and even more primitive vertebrates, such as the hagfish. some animals encode multiple cathelicidins in their genome, whereas others have only one. this report identifies and characterizes feline cathelicidin (fecath) as the sole cathelicidin in domestic cats (felis catus). expression of fecath is predominantly found in the bone marrow, with lower levels of expression in the gastrointestinal tract and skin. by immunocytochemistry, fecath localizes to the cytoplasm of neutrophils in feline peripheral blood. structurally, the mature fecath sequence is most similar to a subgroup of cathelicidins that form linear alpha-helices. fecath possesses antimicrobial activity against e. coli d31, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (ir715), listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus pseudintermedius (clinical isolate) similar to that of the human ortholog, ll-37. in contrast, fecath lacks the dna binding activity seen with ll-37. given its similarity in sequence, structure, tissue expression, and antimicrobial activity, the cathelicidin encoded by cats, fecath, belongs to the subgroup of linear cathelicidins found not only in humans, but also non-human primates, dogs, mice,  and rats.

TI  == quorum sensing in veterinary pathogens: mechanisms, clinical importance and future perspectives.
AB  == under certain circumstances the individuals of a bacterial population may find advantages in acting together and making "collective decisions". this phenomenon  is better known as quorum sensing. when the concentration of signal molecules produced by the surrounding bacteria exceeds a certain threshold, the bacterial population acts as a single organism, collectively expressing virulence genes, biofilm forming genes, etc. several mechanisms of quorum sensing are discussed, each with its distinct signal molecules and respective receptors. some of these mechanisms are restricted to sensing intraspecies signalling, but interspecies and even interkingdom signalling have also been described. several veterinary pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium use quorum sensing as a means to optimize virulence gene expression and host colonization. therefore, targeting of the qs mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for combating bacterial infections, also in veterinary medicine.
