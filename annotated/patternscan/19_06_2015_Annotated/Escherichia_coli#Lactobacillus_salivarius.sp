TI  == effect of probiotic lactobacillus salivarius ubl s22 and prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide on serum lipids, inflammatory markers, insulin sensitivity, and gut bacteria in healthy young volunteers: a randomized controlled single-blind pilot study.
AB  == this study investigated the effect of 6-week supplementation of a probiotic strain lactobacillus salivarius ubl s22 with or without prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide (fos) on serum lipid profiles, immune responses, insulin sensitivity, and gut lactobacilli in 45 healthy young individuals. the patients were divided into 3 groups (15/group), that is, placebo, probiotic, and synbiotic. after 6 weeks, a significant reduction (p < .05) in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol, and triglycerides and increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in the probiotic as well as in  the synbiotic group when compared to placebo; however, the results of total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were more pronounced in the synbiotic group. similarly, when compared to the placebo group, the serum concentrations of inflammatory markers such as high sensitivity c-reactive protein, interleukin (il) 6, il-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly (p < .05) reduced in both the experimental groups, but again the reduction in the synbiotic group was more pronounced. also, an increase (p < .05) in the fecal counts of total lactobacilli and a decrease (p < .05) in coliforms and escherichia coli was observed in both the experimental groups after 6 weeks of ingestion. overall, the combination of l salivarius with fos was observed to be more beneficial than l salivarius alone, thereby advocating that such synbiotic combinations could be therapeutically exploited for improved health and quality of life.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [substrate specificities of bile salt hydrolase 1 and its mutants from lactobacillus salivarius].
AB  == in order to analyze the correlation between critical residues in the catalytic centre of bsh and the enzyme substrate specificity, seven mutants of lactobacillus salivarius bile salt hydrolase (bsh1) were constructed by using the escherichia coli pet-20b(+) gene expression system, rational design and site-directed mutagenesis. these bsh1 mutants exhibited different hydrolytic activities against various conjugated bile salts through substrate specificities  comparison. among the residues being tested, cys2 and thr264 were deduced as key  sites for bsh1 to catalyze taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid, respectively. moreover, cys2 and thr264 were important for keeping the catalytic activity of bsh1. the high conservative cys2 was not the only active site, other mutant amino acid sites were possibly involved in substrate binding. these mutant residues might influence the space and shape of the substrate-binding pockets or the channel size for substrate passing through and entering active site of bsh1, thus, the hydrolytic activity of bsh1 was changed to different conjugated bile salt.

TI  == regulation of host weight gain and lipid metabolism by bacterial bile acid modification in the gut.
AB  == alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota have been implicated in obesity in mice and humans, but the key microbial functions influencing host energy metabolism and adiposity remain to be determined. despite an increased understanding of the genetic content of the gastrointestinal microbiome, functional analyses of common microbial gene sets are required. we established a  controlled expression system for the parallel functional analysis of microbial alleles in the murine gut. using this approach we show that bacterial bile salt hydrolase (bsh) mediates a microbe-host dialogue that functionally regulates host lipid metabolism and plays a profound role in cholesterol metabolism and weight gain in the host. expression of cloned bsh enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract  of gnotobiotic or conventionally raised mice significantly altered plasma bile acid signatures and regulated transcription of key genes involved in lipid metabolism (ppargamma, angptl4), cholesterol metabolism (abcg5/8), gastrointestinal homeostasis (regiiigamma), and circadian rhythm (dbp, per1/2) in the liver or small intestine. high-level expression of bsh in conventionally raised mice resulted in a significant reduction in host weight gain, plasma cholesterol, and liver triglycerides, demonstrating the overall impact of elevated bsh activity on host physiology. in addition, bsh activity in vivo varied according to bsh allele group, indicating that subtle differences in activity can have significant effects on the host. in summary, we demonstrate that bacterial bsh activity significantly impacts the systemic metabolic processes and adiposity in the host and represents a key mechanistic target for the control of obesity and hypercholesterolemia.

TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
AB  == unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e.  coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry),  mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting  in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
AB  == a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph  2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species  lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility  patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent  in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves  (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production  though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a  reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.

TI  == combining de novo and reference-guided assembly with scaffold_builder.
AB  == genome sequencing has become routine, however genome assembly still remains a challenge despite the computational advances in the last decade. in particular, the abundance of repeat elements in genomes makes it difficult to assemble them into a single complete sequence. identical repeats shorter than the average read  length can generally be assembled without issue. however, longer repeats such as  ribosomal rna operons cannot be accurately assembled using existing tools. the application scaffold_builder was designed to generate scaffolds - super contigs of sequences joined by n-bases - based on the similarity to a closely related reference sequence. this is independent of mate-pair information and can be used  complementarily for genome assembly, e.g. when mate-pairs are not available or have already been exploited. scaffold_builder was evaluated using simulated pyrosequencing reads of the bacterial genomes escherichia coli 042, lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi str. p-stx-12. moreover, we sequenced two genomes from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 g455 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sdt1291 and show that scaffold_builder decreases the number of contig sequences by 53% while more  than doubling their average length. scaffold_builder is written in python and is  available at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/scaffold_builder. a web-based implementation is additionally provided to allow users to submit a reference genome and a set of contigs to be scaffolded.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == surface glycosaminoglycans mediate adherence between hela cells and lactobacillus salivarius lv72.
AB  == background: the adhesion of lactobacilli to the vaginal surface is of paramount importance to develop their probiotic functions. for this reason, the role of hela cell surface proteoglycans in the attachment of lactobacillus salivarius lv72, a mutualistic strain of vaginal origin, was investigated. results: incubation of cultures with a variety of glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate  a and c, heparin and heparan sulfate) resulted in marked binding interference. however, no single glycosaminoglycan was able to completely abolish cell binding, the sum of all having an additive effect that suggests cooperation between them and recognition of specific adhesins on the bacterial surface. in contrast, chondroitin sulfate b enhanced cell to cell attachment, showing the relevance of  the stereochemistry of the uronic acid and the sulfation pattern on binding. elimination of the hela surface glycosaminoglycans with lyases also resulted in severe adherence impairment. advantage was taken of the lactobacillus-glycosaminoglycans interaction to identify an adhesin from the bacterial surface. this protein, identify as a soluble binding protein of an abc  transporter system (oppa) by maldi-tof/(ms), was overproduced in escherichia coli, purified and shown to interfere with l. salivarius lv72 adhesion to hela cells. conclusions: these data suggest that glycosaminoglycans play a fundamental role in attachment of mutualistic bacteria to the epithelium that lines the cavities where the normal microbiota thrives, oppa being a bacterial adhesin involved in the process.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == identification and characterization of a bile salt hydrolase from lactobacillus salivarius for development of novel alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters.
AB  == antibiotic growth promoters (agps) have been used as feed additives to improve average body weight gain and feed efficiency in food animals for more than 5 decades. however, there is a worldwide trend to limit agp use to protect food safety and public health, which raises an urgent need to discover effective alternatives to agps. the growth-promoting effect of agps has been shown to be highly correlated with the decreased activity of intestinal bile salt hydrolase (bsh), an enzyme that is produced by various gut microflora and involved in host  lipid metabolism. thus, bsh inhibitors are likely promising feed additives to agps to improve animal growth performance. in this study, the genome of lactobacillus salivarius nrrl b-30514, a bsh-producing strain isolated from chicken, was sequenced by a 454 gs flx sequencer. a bsh gene identified by genome analysis was cloned and expressed in an escherichia coli expression system for enzymatic analyses. the bsh displayed efficient hydrolysis activity for both glycoconjugated and tauroconjugated bile salts, with slightly higher catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/k(m)) on glycoconjugated bile salts. the optimal ph and temperature for the bsh activity were 5.5 and 41 degrees c, respectively. examination of a panel of dietary compounds using the purified bsh identified some potent bsh inhibitors, in which copper and zinc have been recently demonstrated to promote feed digestion and body weight gain in different food animals. in sum, this study identified and characterized a bsh with broad substrate specificity from a chicken l. salivarius strain and established a solid platform for us to discover novel bsh inhibitors, the promising feed additives to replace agps for enhancing the productivity and sustainability of food animals.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans include possible antitumor activity.
AB  == this study examined the effects of three lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici were found to inhibit the development and growth of the worm. compared to escherichia coli used as the control, l. reuteri  and p. acidilactici reduced the lifespan of wild-type and short-lived daf-16 worms. on the contrary, l. salivarius extended the lifespan of daf-16 worms when  used live, but reduced it as uv-killed bacteria. the three lab induced the expression of genes involved in pathogen response and inhibited the growth of tumor-like germ cells, without affecting daf16 localization or increasing corpse  cells. our results suggest the possible use of c. elegans as a model for studying the antitumor attributes of lab. the negative effects of these lab strains on the nematode also indicate their potential use against parasitic nematodes.

AB  == different rates of bacterial translocation across the gut mucosa have been reported but few studies have examined translocation of commensals at the level of the gut epithelial microfold (m) cell. we used an in vitro m-cell model to quantify translocation and determine the transcriptional response of m cells to various commensal bacteria. the transport kinetics and gene expression profile of m cells in response to different bacterial strains, namely lactobacillus salivarius, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, was assessed. bacterial strains translocated across m cells with different efficiencies; e. coli and b. fragilis translocated with equal efficiency whereas l. salivarius translocated with less efficiency. microarray analysis of the m cell response showed both common and differential gene expression changes between the bacterial strains. in the presence of bacteria, but not control beads, up-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription regulation whereas pro-inflammatory and stress response genes were primarily up-regulated by e. coli and b. fragilis, but not l. salivarius nor beads. translocation of bacteria and m-cell gene expression responses were confirmed in murine m cells following bacterial challenge in vivo. these results demonstrate that m cells have the ability to discriminate between different commensal bacteria and modify subsequent immune responses.

TI  == effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == yeast cell wall (ycw) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of lab. this extract was metabolised by the  bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of lactobacillus plantarum, l. salivarius, and enterococcus faecium to caco-2 cells. yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance lab intestinal populations and  control pathogens.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactobacillus salivarius mtc 1026 as a potential probiotic.
AB  == researchers are becoming more interested in studying probiotics at present due to their benefit to human and animal health. in this study, newly isolated strains from human feces were evaluated for probiotic properties. a total of sixty isolated strains were collected from feces and six out of sixty isolated strains  could inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi and salmonella typhimurium. the strain which gave the best inhibitory effect was selected for further characterization as a probiotic strain. the identification of this strain was analyzed on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics and 16s rdna gene sequence. this strain was gram-positive, rod shaped, and catalase and oxidase-negative, and produced acids from d-glucose, d-fructose, lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin and starch. it could not hydrolyze esculin or red blood cells. based on its 16s rdna gene sequence, it was lactobacillus salivarius, and so was called l. salivarius mtc 1026 in this study, and was closely related with l. salivarius dspv 344t isolated from the calf gut. it was able to survive in gastric and small intestinal juices at ph 2.0 and 1.0% bile salt for several hours and also could grow at 45 degrees c. moreover, this strain showed inhibitory activity against a variety of food-borne pathogens. it was highly sensitive to piperacillin, chloramphenicl, ampicillin, erythromycin and ceftazidime. after plasmid curing, this strain was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. l. salivarius mtc 1026 could significantly inhibit the adhesion process of e. coli atcc 25922 and s. typhimurium atcc 13311 on caco-2 monolayers in a competition assay and also reduced invasion of both pathogens (4-log cfu/ml) in an exclusion and displacement assay. therefore, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that l.  salivarius mtc 1026 has shown promising properties as a candidate for a potential probiotic for applications in humans and animals.

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == regulation of the il-10/il-12 axis in human dendritic cells with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == in this study, we have used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs) to design a screening model for the selection of microorganisms with the ability to suppress  dc-secreted il-12p70, a critical cytokine for the induction of t-helper cell type 1 immune responses under inflammatory conditions. by the treatment of dcs with cocktails containing tlr agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12p70. clinically used probiotics were tested for their il-10- and il-12p70-stimulating properties in immature dcs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the il-10/il-12p70 balance. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm() and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 showed a strong  induction of il-12p70, whereas lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 and bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced il-10. escherichia coli nissle 1917 induced both il-10 and il-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines. when combining these microorganisms with the th1-promoting cocktails, e. coli nissle 1917 and b. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of il-12p70 secretion in an il-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells. the present model, using cocktail-stimulated dcs with potent il-12p70-stimulating capacity, may be used as an efficient tool to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of microorganisms for potential clinical use.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.

AB  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of  probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of  the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and  at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.

TI  == effect of four probiotic strains and escherichia coli o157:h7 on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression.
AB  == controversy exists as to whether contact between a probiotic bacterial cell and an epithelial cell in the gut is needed to confer beneficial effects of probiotics, or whether metabolites from probiotics are sufficient to cause this effect. to address this question, caco-2 cells were treated with cell-free supernatants of four probiotics, bifidobacterium lactis 420, bifidobacterium lactis hn019, lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, and by a cell-free supernatant of a pathogenic bacteria, escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). tight junction integrity as well as expression of cyclo-oxygenases, which are prostaglandin-producing enzymes, were measured. probiotic-specific as well as ehec-specific effects on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression  were evident, indicating that live bacterial cells were not necessary for the manifestation of the effects. b. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant increased tight junction integrity, while ehec cell-free supernatant induced damage on tight junctions. in general, ehec and probiotics had opposite effects upon cyclo-oxygenase expression. furthermore, b. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant protected the tight junctions from ehec-induced damage when administered prior to the cell-free supernatant of ehec. these results indicate that probiotics produce bioactive metabolites, suggesting that consumption of specific probiotic bacteria might be beneficial in protecting intestinal epithelial cells from the deleterious effects of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == three lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic escherichia coli grown in vitro.
AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. in this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among etec agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (scs) from healthy infant stool. only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal c2bbel (caco-2) cell line. isolate identification using api 50chl strips showed that they belonged to different lactobacillus species, i.e.,  lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4. the scs still had an inhibitory effect on etec after heating (100  degrees c, 15 min). the lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the ph of scs was adjusted to neutral (ph 7.2) to reduce the scs inhibitory effect. antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (lab)-scs with etec suspension. after 4h of co-culture, etec growth was inhibited. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2, l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4 could be used as an effective control for etec.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == inhibition of salmonella typhimurium attachment to chicken cecal mucus by intestinal isolates of enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli.
AB  == the ability of selected strains of enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of adult chickens to inhibit in vitro attachment of salmonella typhimurium 3333/o to cecal mucus in the presence or absence of d-mannose was determined. attachment in the absence of mannose was reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of two isolates of enterobacteriaceae, an escherichia coli and a hafnia alvei strain, but not to a third isolate, an enterobacter agglomerans strain. attachment of s. typhimurium was not inhibited when mannose was present in the blocking or attachment step. formation of fimbriae by the two inhibitory enterobacteriaceae strains and the s. typhimurium  strain, as indicated by titers of mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was optimal in z biphasic medium (consisting of tryptone, yeast  extract, dextrose, and nacl) incubated anaerobically at 42 c. fimbriae of each of three strains prepared from these cultures also inhibited attachment. these are characteristics consistent with attachment and inhibition of attachment mediated  by a mannose-sensitive adhesin associated with type 1 fimbriae on bacterial cells of enterobacteriaceae strains. attachment in the presence of mannose was significantly reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of a lactobacillus salivarius strain and a lactobacillus delbrueckii delbrueckii strain but not to a strain of lactobacillus for which the species had not been determined. washed cells or spent culture supernatant fluid from brain-heart infusion broth, z broth, or z biphasic cultures of the inhibitory strains of lactobacilli incubated at 37 or 42 c inhibited this form of attachment. of 27 intestinal isolates of enterobacteriaceae and 21 of lactobacilli, the lactobacilli strains were generally more hydrophobic than the enterobacteriaceae as determined by adherence to hexadecane. the lactobacilli isolates did not agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes. the data suggest more than one mechanism for mediating attachment of inhibitory bacterial strains and for subsequent attachment of s. typhimurium.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

AB  == a total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. strains of lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and lact. acidophilus and lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before e. coli), competition (lactobacilli and e. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (e. coli added before lactobacilli). tests were made with [14c]-labelled e. coli. suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of e. coli attachment. some strains  of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic e. coli with k88 fimbriae, but  not with a k88-negative mutants strain. these were excluded from the competitive  exclusion experiments. in the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of e. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid  bacteria.

AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  == 1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli  exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains  used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
