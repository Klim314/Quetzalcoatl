comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in ganzi autonomous prefecture.
aim: to compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of tibetan, yi and han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. methods: the test subjects were selected from 2 tibetan, 2 yi and 3 han populated places, respectively. total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. after 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) of gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among tibetan, yi and han nationalities. the bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. the incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in tibetan population was significantly lower than that of han and yi population. conclusion: there is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of tibetan, yi and han people. all of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
r-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on catheters or other surgical implants. the persistent increasing resistance of s. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (r-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. we found that r-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hrbcs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. excellent in vivo protective effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that r-thanatin disturbed cell division of mrse severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of mrse growth. these findings indicate that r-thanatin is active against the growth and biofilm formation of mrse in vitro and in vivo. r-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating cons infections.
chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of an antimicrobial peptide gonococcal growth inhibitor.
gonococcal growth inhibitor 1 (ggi-1) is a 44-residue peptide with potent anti-legionella activity. it has been isolated from staphylococcus haemolyticus but, to date, its chemical synthesis has not been reported. acquisition of this peptide via this means would enable a more detailed examination of its antimicrobial properties. however, its synthesis represents a significant challenge because of two predicted "difficult sequences" within the peptide. its successful solid-phase assembly is reported in this paper, and was accomplished by use of simple palliative measures including the introduction of a single pseudo-proline isostere in order to counteract on-resin aggregation. the peptide had moderate antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli but was inactive against another gram-negative bacterium and two gram-positive bacteria (bacillus species). it had significant haemolytic activity, with a h(50) (concentration of peptide that causes 50 % haemolysis) of 20 and 125 mum for two blood samples from different donors. an alternative therapeutic index to that proposed for ggi-1 in a recent publication is proposed.
membrane stability and mitochondrial activity of human-ejaculated spermatozoa during in vitro experimental infection with escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus and bacteroides ureolyticus.
the aim of the study was to examine an in vitro effect of the three bacterial strains (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus and bacteroides ureolyticus) on ejaculated spermatozoa with reference to sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity. the study was carried out on swim-up-separated spermatozoa from 12 normozoospermic volunteers. sperm plasma membrane stability was evaluated by the live/dead sperm viability kit and by the merocyanine 540 test. mitochondrial activity was evaluated using the jc-1 test as well as the nadh-dependent nbt assay. the percentage of dead cells was significantly higher in spermatozoa treated with b. ureolyticus as compared to that of control spermatozoa (p < 0.01). all the bacterial strains applied affected sperm plasma membrane architecture measured by m540 test (p < 0.01). moreover, the presence of e. coli or b. ureolyticus was connected with significant decrease in both the number of cells with high mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsim) and the cells with normal oxidoreductive function of mitochondria (p < 0.05 as compared to untreated cells). to conclude, the contact of bacteria with ejaculated spermatozoa can be a reason for severe injury of sperm membrane stability and mitochondrial activity with potential consequences for male fertility.
beauvericin from the endophytic fungus, fusarium redolens, isolated from dioscorea zingiberensis and its antibacterial activity.
from the fungal endophyte, fusarium redolens dzf2, isolated from rhizomes of the  chinese medicinal plant dioscorea zingiberensis, beauvericin was obtained by tlc in combination with bioautographic antibacterial assay. the compound was identified by spectroscopic and physicochemical means. the median effective inhibitory concentration (ic50) values of beauvericin against six test bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas lachrymans, agrobacterium tumefaciens, escherichia coli and xanthomonas vesicatoria) were between 18.4 and 70.7 microg/ml. the beauvericin content of f. redolens dzf2 mycelia was 9.60 mg/g dw, and beauvericin yield 62.4 mg/l. the obtained results show the potential use of the endophytic fungus for its biological role in providing its host plant with protection, as well as the possible development of beauvericin as an antibacterial.
a lectin (cflec-2) aggregating staphylococcus haemolyticus from scallop chlamys farreri.
lectins are a family of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play crucial roles in innate immunity. in this study, a new lectin (cflec-2) gene was cloned from chlamys farreri by est and race approaches. the full-length cdna of cflec-2 was composed of 708bp, encoding a typical long form carbohydrate-recognition domain of 130 residues. the deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to brevican in homo sapiens, c-type lectin-1 and lectin-2 in anguilla japonica. the cdna fragment encoding the mature peptide of cflec-2 was recombined into plasmid pet-32a (+) and expressed in escherichia coli rosseta-gami (de3). the recombinant cflec-2 (rcflec-2) protein exhibited aggregative activity toward staphylococcus haemolyticus, and the agglutination could be inhibited by d-mannose but not edta or d-galactose, indicating that cflec-2 was a ca2+ independent lectin. moreover, rcflec-2 could suppress the growth of e. coli top10f'. these results suggested that cflec-2 was perhaps involved in the recognition and clearance of bacterial pathogens in scallop.
[comparison of the antibacterial efficacy of doxycycline and tetracycline (author's transl)].
in order to explain the mechanism of resistance within the tetracycline group, the minimal inhibitory concentration of tetracycline hcl was compared with that of doxycycline in the micro dilution test for bacterial collectives of 48 strains each from the groups of gram-negative and gram-positive cocci, resp. there was no significant difference between the inhibitory effect of doxycycline and tetracycline hcl for the bacterial collectives of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus and staphylococcus aureus heamolyticus strains which were inhibited by a relatively low concentration of tetracycline hcl and doxycycline, respectively. on the other hand a significant difference in inhibitory effect was observed the calculation was made according to the kolmogoroff-smirnov test for the bacterial collectives of enterococci and staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strains which were tetracycline resistant or only inhibited by higher concentrations. these results also have a practical importance, because a further testing against doxycycline can bring about a sensitivity to this substance in case of tetracycline resistant grampositive cocci. possible explanations for the higher efficacy of doxycycline on these bacterial collectives will be discussed.
