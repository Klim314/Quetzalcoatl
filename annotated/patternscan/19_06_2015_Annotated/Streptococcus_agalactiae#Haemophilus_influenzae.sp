TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  == introduction: ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is currently approved by the fda for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) in adults. areas covered: this review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for absssi and cabp; and adverse effects. expert opinion: ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant gram-positive organisms and select gram-negative pathogens. the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. there is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been  published in a small series of case reports. randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in japan--a country where haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  == to investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in japan where haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (pcv7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. the nationwide japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. we analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. we also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. in the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. h. influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli were the main organisms. the number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased  from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). the incidence of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. only 0-2 cases with neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. the median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). the fatality rate for s. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low csf glucose, s. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive csf culture. hib vaccine and pcv7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among japanese children.

TI  == [rapid identification of meningitis due to bacterial pathogens].
AB  == we constructed a new real-time pcr method to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from patient due to bacterial meningitis. the eight pathogens targeted in the pcr are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aurues, neisseria meningitides, listeria monocytogenes, esherichia coli, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the total time from dna extraction from csf to pcr analysis was 1.5 hour. the pathogens were detected in 72% of the csf samples (n=115) by real-time pcr, but in only 48% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. the detection rate of pathogens with pcr was significantly better than that with  cultures in patients with antibiotic administration.in conclusion, detection with real-time pcr is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in children in iceland, 1975-2010: a nationwide epidemiological study.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is a serious and potentially rapid life-threatening disease. therefore, to ensure appropriate treatment, early recognition of signs and symptoms is imperative, along with knowledge of the epidemiology and microbiology of the disease. methods: a long-term, nationwide epidemiological study of bacterial causes of meningitis in children (</= 18 y) in iceland during the period 1975-2010 was carried out. a detailed chart review was  performed of all cases diagnosed in 1995-2010. results: a total of 477 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis during the period 1975-2010. of these, 67% were aged under 5 y. the most common pathogens were neisseria meningitidis (n = 265), haemophilus influenzae (n = 132), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 47), and  streptococcus agalactiae (n = 19); their incidences varied according to age. the  age-specific incidence (cases/100,000/y) dropped from 26 in 1975 to 1 in 2010 (p  < 0.001). the most common symptoms during the period 1995-2010 were fever (92%),  vomiting (67%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and rashes/petechiae (51%). h. influenzae  type b disappeared following implementation of hib vaccination in 1989, and, likewise, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis fell significantly after vaccination against meningococcus serogroup c was initiated in 2002 (p < 0.001).  the overall 30-day case fatality rate of bacterial meningitis was 4.4% and remained unchanged during the study period. conclusions: the incidence of childhood bacterial meningitis has been reduced significantly by successful vaccinations against h. influenzae type b and n. meningitidis serogroup c. nevertheless, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged and thus the disease  is still a serious threat to childhood health. further prevention by novel vaccines and improved management of childhood meningitis is an exciting challenge.

TI  == prospective multi-centre sentinel surveillance for haemophilus influenzae type b  & other bacterial meningitis in indian children.
AB  == background & objectives: haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is one of the leading bacterial causes of invasive disease in populations without access to hib conjugate vaccines (hib-cv). india has recently decided to introduce hib-cv into  the routine immunization programme in selected states. longitudinal data quantifying the burden of bacterial meningitis and the proportion of disease caused by various bacteria are needed to track the impact of hib-cv once introduced. a hospital-based sentinel surveillance network was established at four places in the country and this study reports the results of this ongoing surveillance. methods: children aged 1 to 23 months with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in chennai, lucknow, new delhi, and vellore between july 2008 and june 2010. all cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples were tested using cytological, biochemical, and culture methods. samples with abnormal csf (>/=10 wbc per mul) were tested by latex agglutination test for common paediatric bacterial meningitis pathogens. results: a total of 708 patients with abnormal csf were identified, 89 of whom had a bacterial pathogen confirmed. hib accounted for the majority of bacteriologically confirmed cases, 62 (70%), while streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus were identified in 12 (13%) and seven (8%) cases, respectively. the other eight cases were a mix of other bacteria. the proportion of abnormal csf and probable bacterial meningitis that was caused by hib was 74 and 58 per cent lower at christian medical college (cmc), vellore, which had a 41 per cent coverage of hib-cv among all suspected meningitis cases, compared to the combined average proportion at the other three  centres where a coverage between 1 and 8 per cent was seen (p<0.001 and p= 0.05,  respectively). interpretation & conclusions: hib was found to be the predominant  cause of bacterial meningitis in young children in diverse geographic locations in india. possible indications of herd immunity was seen at cmc compared to sites with low immunization coverage with hib-cv. as hib is the most common pathogen in bacterial meningitis, hib-cv would have a large impact on bacterial meningitis in indian children.

TI  == [childhood bacterial meningitis trends in japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  == we conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from january 2009 to december 2010 in japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases  (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). children younger than one  year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence  decreased with increasing age. haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the h. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the s. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics  for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). the final antibiotics for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (ctx) or ceftriaxone (ctrx) and carbapenem, respectively. the overall  fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). since the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv7) are not widely used in japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by h. influenzae) had been immunized with the hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the pcv7 vaccine. no remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in japan.

AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == a multi-target real-time pcr assay for rapid identification of meningitis-associated microorganisms.
AB  == a central nervous system (cns) infection, such as meningitis, is a serious and life-threatening condition. bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in  brain damage, disability or even death. rapid diagnosis of cns infections and identification of the pathogenic microorganisms are needed to improve the patient outcome. bacterial culture of a patient's cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is currently  considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing bacterial meningitis. from the csf  cultures researchers can assess the in vitro susceptibility of the causative microorganism to determine the best antibiotic treatment. however, many of the culture assays, such as microscopy and the latex agglutination test are not sensitive. to enhance pathogen detection in csf samples we developed a multi-target real-time pcr assay that can rapidly identify six different microorganisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and cryptococcus neoformans. in this study we applied this pcr analysis to 296 csf samples from patients who were suspected of having meningitis. of the 296 samples that were examined, 59 samples were positive according to the csf culture and/or molecular  assays. forty-six csf samples were positive for both the csf culture and our real-time pcr assay, while 13 samples were positive for the real-time pcr but negative for the traditional assays. this discrepancy may have been caused by the fact that these samples were collected from 23 patients who were treated with antimicrobials before csf sampling.

TI  == detection of acute childhood meningitis by pcr, culture and agglutination tests in tabriz, iran.
AB  == meningitis is one of the hazardous and life threatening infections and is associated with mortality and morbidity. the aim of this study was to determine etiological agents of childhood bacterial meningitis. the culture, gram staining, agglutination and pcr assays were used to examine csf specimens from 277 patients with presumed bacterial meningitis for the occurrence of 4 most common infectious agents consist of n. meningitis, h. influnsae, s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae between 2008 and 2009 at different wards of the children hospital of tabriz. the  mean age of patients was 35 +/- 2 (mean +/- sem) month, (minimum 11 days maximum  14 years), of all cases 59.6% male and 40.4% female. overall the diagnosis was confirmed with a csf culture in 11/277 (3.97%), by agglutination test in 14/277 (5.05%). the isolated bacteria included s. pneumoniae 5 cases, h. influnsae 2 cases, n. meningitis 3 cases and p. aeroginusae 1 case. a positive pcr assay allowed us to diagnose bacterial meningitis in 19 patients (6.8%). in the present study, we found pcr to be a useful and sensitive method for the detection of bacterial dna in the csf samples from suspected meningitis patients. furthermore, to maximize management of meningitis cases, a combination of culture and pcr is necessary.

TI  == clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  == aim: to investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) hyperintensity. materials and methods: the clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid dwi hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. results: the patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes. the remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by cryptococcus neoformans. subarachnoid dwi hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly  distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). in addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). conclusion: both bacterial and fungal  meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on dwi, predominantly around the frontal lobe. this finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent korean children. we retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. a total of 768 cases were identified. s. agalactiae (48.1%) and s. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. s. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. s. pneumoniae (45.3%) and h. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr.  s. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. s. aureus (50.6%), salmonella species (16.9%), and s. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. a significant decline in h. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in korean children.

TI  == socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among us adults.
AB  == objectives: we examined associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia among us adults. methods: we analyzed data on 4870 adults aged 18 years or older with community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia identified through active, population-based surveillance in 9 states and geocoded to census tract of residence. we used data from the 2000 us census to calculate incidence by age, race/ethnicity, and census tract characteristics and poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (rrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). results: during 2003 to 2004, the average annual incidence of bacteremic pneumonia was 24.2 episodes per 100 000 black adults versus 10.1 per 100 000 white adults (rr = 2.40; 95% ci = 2.24, 2.57). incidence among black residents of census tracts with 20% or more of persons in poverty (most impoverished) was 4.4  times the incidence among white residents of census tracts with less than 5% of persons in poverty (least impoverished). racial disparities in incidence were reduced but remained significant in models that controlled for age, census tract  poverty level, and state. conclusions: adults living in impoverished census tracts are at increased risk of bacteremic pneumonia and should be targeted for prevention efforts.

TI  == mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (csf) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. a few bacterial pathogens are  able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans,  a rare but dreadful disease. surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae). the particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate  immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-csf barrier. in vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, e. coli  and s. agalactiae to reach the csf. n. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type iv pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. recent work has shown that n. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex  par3/par6/apkc that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.

AB  == the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) inhibitory titer (csf-it) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's mic in the csf, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic  selection in treating bacterial meningitis. the csf-it was determined via a microdilution method. a suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube  containing twofold diluted csf and double-concentrated mueller-hinton broth with  supplement. the csf-it was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees c. concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (blnar), the  killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (pk) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in csf were simulated. organisms recovered from the csf in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were h. influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the csf-it ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. in the in vitro pk model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the mics over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and  bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. a csf-it value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the csf exceeds the mic for 24 h. the effect of piperacillin on blnar depends not only on the time above mic of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the csf.

TI  == [epidemiology of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in france].
AB  == in 2006, the number of bacterial meningitis cases was estimated at 1375 (2.23/100,000). the leading pathogens involved in adult meningitis were, according to frequency, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae. the overall mortality rate averaged 20%, higher among patients with pneumococcal meningitis or in individuals over 65 years of age. sequels were observed in 30% of cases and more frequent after pneumococcal meningitis. a decrease in susceptibility to antibiotics was reported for n. meningitidis, s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. generalized vaccination of children less than two years of age with h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has lead to a dramatic decrease in adult h. influenza meningitis. the few cases involved almost exclusively non-typeable strains, presenting in 12% of cases, a modified penicillin binding protein leading to a decreased susceptibility to aminopenicillins. decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin was observed in 30% of meningococcal isolates, but  all strains remained susceptible to parenteral third generation cephalosporins. resistances to rifampicin or to ciprofloxacin, recommended in meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, were unusual, but had to be documented. finally, the proportion of pneumococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams  has decreased since 2002. in adult meningitis, pneumococcal isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone accounted for 37, 18, and 4% of cases respectively. it should be noted that for these isolates, no parenteral third generation cephalosporins mic  was above 2mg/l. resistance to rifampin was very unusual and all pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to glycopeptides.

TI  == tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in italy.
AB  == background: in this study (part of the global test program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in italy was evaluated. methods: a total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the clsi in 2005. results: globally, 135 gram-negative and 65 gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against acinetobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic(90) <or=1 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens. these data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.

TI  == effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  == the activity of eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of s. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of s. agalactiae, 20 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of h. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. the cytotoxicity was evaluated on  vero cells by the mtt test. the antibacterial activity was evaluated by the kirby bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. h. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and s. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae. the antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild  activity on mumps virus.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of seventeen streptococcus pneumoniae strains: insights into the pneumococcal supragenome.
AB  == the distributed-genome hypothesis (dgh) states that pathogenic bacteria possess a supragenome that is much larger than the genome of any single bacterium and that  these pathogens utilize genetic recombination and a large, noncore set of genes as a means of diversity generation. we sequenced the genomes of eight nasopharyngeal strains of streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from pediatric patients with upper respiratory symptoms and performed quantitative genomic analyses among these and nine publicly available pneumococcal strains. coding sequences from all strains were grouped into 3,170 orthologous gene clusters, of  which 1,454 (46%) were conserved among all 17 strains. the majority of the gene clusters, 1,716 (54%), were not found in all strains. genic differences per strain pair ranged from 35 to 629 orthologous clusters, with each strain's genome containing between 21 and 32% noncore genes. the distribution of the orthologous  clusters per genome for the 17 strains was entered into the finite-supragenome model, which predicted that (i) the s. pneumoniae supragenome contains more than  5,000 orthologous clusters and (ii) 99% of the orthologous clusters ( approximately 3,000) that are represented in the s. pneumoniae population at frequencies of >or=0.1 can be identified if 33 representative genomes are sequenced. these extensive genic diversity data support the dgh and provide a basis for understanding the great differences in clinical phenotype associated with various pneumococcal strains. when these findings are taken together with previous studies that demonstrated the presence of a supragenome for streptococcus agalactiae and haemophilus influenzae, it appears that the possession of a distributed genome is a common host interaction strategy.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == [use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

TI  == [trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in japan (2003-2004)].
AB  == we surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between january 2003 and december 2004 in japan, with the following results: bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. the age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, and escherichia coli. the relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group b. streptococcus and e. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of h. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of s. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against gbs, e. coli and listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. a combination of carbapenem which showed effective against prsp and cephem which showed effective against h. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.

TI  == characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (gshf) of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ecl) and glutathione synthetase (gs) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ecl is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas gs enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain atp-grasp fold. this generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the pasteurellaceae member haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed gshf), as has been reported recently for the  gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes. here, we show that yet another member of the pasteurellaceae family, pasteurella  multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and gshf-driven biosynthesis. domain architecture analysis shows that this p. multocida gshf bifunctional ligase contains an n-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ecl-like domain followed by a typical atp-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known gs ligases. recombinant p. multocida gshf overexpresses as an approximately 85-kda protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. the gamma-ecl activity of gshf is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (k(i) = 13.6 mm). furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of gshf proteins.

TI  == trends in the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of group b streptococcal prevention.
AB  == aim: to assess trends in the epidemiology of culture-proven and clinical neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. methods: since 1995, the neonatal services of 28 acute-care teaching hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo") have been involved in the prospective surveillance of neonatal infection of vertical transmission. we here report the comparison of the incidence for the periods 1996-1997 and 2000-2001, and look separately at two groups of hospitals according to the time at which the official hospital policy to provide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group b streptococcus (gbs) prevention was adopted. in 16 hospitals the policy was adopted in 1999 and in 10 before 1998 (nine hospitals in 1996, one in 1997). results: the incidence of proven sepsis decreased significantly by 22% and 54% in the hospitals that started prophylaxis in 1999 and before 1998, respectively. the incidence of gbs sepsis also declined significantly by 36.4% and 65.4% in both groups of hospitals, respectively. significant variations in the incidence of clinical vertical sepsis as well as in the incidence of sepsis caused by haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella were not found. sepsis caused by escherichia coli increased in the hospitals with prophylaxis from 1999 and decreased in those that began prophylaxis before 1998, in which the mortality rate of proven and clinical sepsis also decreased significantly by 58.6%. conclusions: there was a substantial decline in the incidence of proven vertical  sepsis, with a significant reduction of gbs sepsis, although decreases were more  marked when antibiotic prophylaxis was started before 1998. in this group of hospitals, there was also a decrease in the mortality rate. fluctuations in the incidence of e. coli infection suggest the need for continuing epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  == real-time pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) were evaluated as rapid methods for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and compared to standard  diagnostic procedures. for pcr, a lightcycler approach was chosen, implementing eubacterial and specific pcr assays for the most relevant bacteria. for fish, a similar probe set containing eubacterial and specific probes was composed of published and newly designed probes. both methods were evaluated by use of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples from patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. for all microscopy- and culture-positive samples (n = 28), the eubacterial pcr was positive. in addition, all identifiable pathogens were detected with specific pcr assays, according to an algorithm based on the gram stain. the fish method detected the pathogen in 13 of 18 positive samples. while  the fish method remained negative for all microscopy- and culture-negative samples (n = 113), the eubacterial pcr was positive for five of these samples. sequencing of the amplicon revealed the presence of neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae in three of these five samples. in addition, samples with discordant results by culture and microscopy were successfully investigated by pcr (10 samples) and fish (5 samples). in conclusion, pcr is a highly sensitive tool for rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. fish is less sensitive but is useful for the identification of csf samples showing bacteria in the gram stain. based on our results, an approach for laboratory diagnosis of meningitis including pcr and fish is discussed.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

AB  == a retrospective study was conducted on 28 patients with bacterial meningitis who  were admitted to our department between april 1988 and march 2002. the most commonly detected pathogen was group b streptococcus in those under 1 month of age and haemophilus influenzae (72.2%) among those over 1 month. the most commonly administered antibiotic combination (67.9%) at the initial treatment was that of cefotaxime (ctx) and ampicillin (abpc). we encountered one case that was  resistant to both ctx and abpc. through this experience, it became apparent that  for the initial treatment of bacterial meningitis in infants, it is necessary to  apply a combination of two antibiotics, instead of a single agent, and new antibiotics should be considered for such combinations rather than persisting on  conventional ctx and abpc. the aforementioned 28 patients were divided into 2 groups--7 patients (25.0%) with sequelae and 21 (75.0%) without--and various factors noted during the diagnosis were evaluated retrospectively. it was found that the number of days leading to admission at the hospital and the development  of convulsions were unrelated to the prognosis. those who succumbed or suffered sequelae were all infants under 1 year of age. all cases were caused by genus haemophilus.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  == this 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. the most prevalent pathogens were salmonellaspecies, streptococcus (s.) agalactiae, escherichia (e.) coli, and haemophilus (h.) influenzae, accounting for about 59%  of the episodes. meningitis caused by salmonella species, e. coli and h. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by s. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with e. coli replacing salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. however, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. the study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this  disease is caused by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and salmonella species. stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels  of consciousness (p = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. the most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.

AB  == the in vitro activity of abt773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens  and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. abt773 was active (mic-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were also inhibited (mic-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to abt773 with the exception of vana mutants. e. faecium showed poor susceptibility  to abt773. the activity of the new ketolide against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. abt773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

TI  == group b streptococcal conjugate vaccines.
AB  == linkage of bacterial capsular polysaccharides to proteins to create conjugate vaccines has had a dramatic impact on the health of children. although unconjugated polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic in infants and some older children and adults, their covalent coupling with proteins stimulates t cell dependent antigenic recognition that profoundly enhances immunogenicity. in the decade since the introduction and widespread use of haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in the united states, invasive h influenzae infections have become a rarity in childhood. similarly, the conjugation of polysaccharides of streptococcus pneumoniae to a derivative of diphtheria toxoid  and the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infant immunisation schedules carries with it promise for a similar decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in paediatric patients.

TI  == bacterial meningitis: current controversies in approaches to treatment.
AB  == acute bacterial meningitis continues to be a disease with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates in both adults and children worldwide, despite advances in antibacterial therapy. death or permanent disability occurs frequently. the causative organism varies with age, immune function and immunisation status. infection with neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is associated with the majority of cases, with listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus agalactiae being more prevalent pathogens at the extremes of age (<3 months or >50 years). antibacterial resistance is an increasing problem, particularly in pneumococcal bacteria but increasingly in other organisms. the increasing prevalence of resistance of pneumococcus to penicillin and the cephalosporins complicates therapy and may have an important impact on treatment outcome. increased understanding of the pathophysiology has allowed advances in diagnosis and therapy. the use of adjunctive corticosteroids remains controversial, but is probably beneficial in reducing neurological sequelae in children. in adults the  evidence is less clear. vaccination has virtually eradicated hib meningitis in some countries. recent introduction of a conjugate vaccine against serogroup c meningococci in the uk has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of invasive disease due to this organism. a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine promises a similar reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. in the meantime, the emergence of widespread resistance of organisms to antibacterial agents, in particular among the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis, remains the biggest challenge in therapy.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == distinct effects of surfactant protein a or d deficiency during bacterial infection on the lung.
AB  == mice lacking surfactant protein (sp)-a (sp-a-/-) or sp-d (sp-d-/-) and wild-type  mice were infected with group b streptococcus or haemophilus influenzae by intratracheal instillation. although decreased killing of group b streptococcus and h. influenzae was observed in sp-a-/- mice but not in sp-d-/- mice, deficiency of either sp-a or sp-d was associated with increased inflammation and  inflammatory cell recruitment in the lung after infection. deficient uptake of bacteria by alveolar macrophages was observed in both sp-a- and sp-d-deficient mice. isolated alveolar macrophages from sp-a-/- mice generated significantly less, whereas those from sp-d-/- mice generated significantly greater superoxide  and hydrogen peroxide compared with wild-type alveolar macrophages. in sp-d-/- mice, bacterial killing was associated with increased lung inflammation, increased oxidant production, and decreased macrophage phagocytosis. in contrast, in the absence of sp-a, bacterial killing was decreased and associated with increased lung inflammation, decreased oxidant production, and decreased macrophage phagocytosis. increased oxidant production likely contributes to effective bacterial killing in the lungs of sp-d-/- mice. the collectins, sp-a and sp-d, play distinct roles during bacterial infection of the lung.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == [meningitis (ii)--acute bacterial meningitis].
AB  == acute meningitis is a medical emergency, particularly in patients with rapidly progressing disease, mental status changes or neurological deficits. the majority of cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a limited number of species, i.e.  streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitis, listeria monocytogenes, group b streptococci (streptococcus agalactiae), haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. many other pathogens can occasionally cause bacterial meningitis, often under special clinical circumstances. treatment of meningitis includes two main goals: eradication of the infecting organism, and management of cns and systemic complications. empiric therapy should be initiated without delay, as the prognosis of the disease depends on the time when therapy is started. one or two blood cultures should be obtained before administering the first antibiotic. empiric therapy is primarily based on the age of the patient, with modifications if there are positive findings on csf gram stain or if the patient presents with special risk factors. it is safer to choose regimens with broad coverage, as they can usually be modified within 24-48 hours, when antibiotic sensitivities of the infecting organism become available. adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone is also administered in severely ill patients concomitantly with the first antibiotic dose. in patients who are clinically stable and are unlikely to be adversely affected if antibiotics are not administered immediately, including those with suspected viral or chronic meningitis, a lumbar puncture represents the first step, unless there is clinical suspicion of an intracerebral mass lesion. findings in the csf and on ct scan, if performed, will guide the further diagnostic work-up and therapy in all patients.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis in children admitted to the queen elizabeth central hospital, blantyre, malawi in 1996-97.
AB  == to design appropriate interventions, we collected clinical and demographic data prospectively on all children aged one day to 14 years admitted with a diagnosis  of bacterial meningitis (bm) from april 1st 1996 to march 31st 1997 to the queen  elizabeth central hospital (qech), blantyre, malawi. during the study period 267  children (2.7% of all paediatric admissions) were found to have bm; 83% were under 5 years of age, 61% under one year and 23% under one month. the most common causative organisms in the post neonatal period (n=206) were streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) 21%, and salmonella typhimurium (6%). in the neonatal group (< 1 month, n=61) the most common causes  were streptococcus agalactiae (23%), s. typhimurium (15%), s. pneumoniae (11.5%)  and other gram negative rods (11.5%). nineteen of 21 salmonella infections were in children under one year of age and all s. agalactiae were in infants under three months. there was delay on presentation: the average length of fever was 4.6 days, 39.5% had convulsed prior to arrival and 57% had an altered level of consciousness. an initial diagnosis of malaria had probably contributed to the delay in 22.5% (42 of 186 tested). 48% were < 80% weight for age, with 18% < 60%) weight for age. the overall mortality was 40%. the outcome was worst in salmonella infections, particularly neonatal salmonella bm with a case fatality rate (cfr) of 89% (8 of 9 cases). coma on presentation worsened prognosis (mortality 64% if blantyre coma score < 3, 26% if > 3). 15% of survivors had sequelae on discharge. 20% of hib isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, but all salmonellae were sensitive. 5% of s. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin  and 8% to chloramphenicol. earlier access to adequate health care and awareness of bm in a malaria-endemic area would reduce mortality and morbidity. vaccination against hib infection would have reduced death by 18 (17%) and prevented sequelae in 7 cases.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

AB  == the standard test card agglutination of antibody-coated latex by neisseria meningitidis. streptococcus group b, haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae antigens has been compared with a technique involving local concentration of the coated latex in an ultrasonic standing wave. the detection of positive control antigen was enhanced, compared with the test-card procedure, over a 16 to 64 fold range on exposure to ultrasound. sample filtration eliminated non-specific agglutination on ultrasonic exposure of latex  in control serum, urine or concentrated urine. tests of meningitis patient body fluids showed increased detection of antigen with ultrasound for csf (11/14 > 7/14) serum (8/13 > 3/13) and concentrated urine (8/17 > 2/17) compared to test card assays. the ultrasound detection of antigen in serum or concentrated urine was comparable to that achieved with csf on test cards. serum dilution experiments showed that ultrasound could detect antigen in serum over a 1000 fold concentration range.

TI  == blood-brain barrier permeability during the development of experimental bacterial meningitis in the rat.
AB  == in an attempt to examine whether routes of bacterial entry into the central nervous system have any bearing on subsequent changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (csf) penetration of circulating 125i-albumin in two different models of experimental meningitis due to k1 escherichia coli, type iii group b streptococcus, or haemophilus influenzae type  b in infant rats: hematogenous meningitis subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation  of bacteria vs meningitis induced by direct inoculation of bacteria into the csf  via the cisterna magna. in the model of hematogenous meningitis, the mean csf penetration was significantly greater in animals with h. influenzae type b meningitis than in those with meningitis due to k1 e. coli or type iii group b streptococcus. in contrast, the mean csf penetration was significantly enhanced in all animals with meningitis induced by intracisternal inoculation regardless of infecting pathogens. tumor necrosis factor activity in csf appeared to correlate with the functional penetration of circulating albumin across the blood-brain barrier in both models of experimental meningitis. these findings suggest that the alterations of blood-brain barrier permeability during development of experimental meningitis may vary for different models of inducing  meningitis and that the mechanisms responsible for these different permeability changes may be multifactorial.

TI  == [usefulness of body surface cultures in newborns with early infection risk. study of 735 neonates].
AB  == objective: difficulty in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis has lead to the practice of superficial cultures. the usefulness of this practice has been criticized repeatedly. patients and methods: results of 3881 cultures performed on 735 newborns (age < or = 48 hr) with early infection risk were reviewed. the types of samples chosen were urine (ur), gastric aspirate (ga), pharyngeal (ps),  external ear (es), umbilical swab (us), meconium (mc) and blood. bbv for sepsis for the different samples is calculated, as well as which ones better reflect vertical transmission. results: at the time of the study, 342 newborns (46.5%) were already colonized. bacteria most frequently isolated were: e. coli (92), pcn staphylococci (85), enterococci (83) and s. agalactiae (70). twenty-nine newborns had bacteriemia, with s. agalactiae being the leading cause (16). es correlated best with positive blood cultures (83.3%). ur culture sensitivity was significantly lower than that of all other samples. the highest ppvs were for ga, ps and us. npv was high and similar for all samples (98-99%). es and us best reflected vertical transmission (p < 0.0001). mc provided the highest number of positive mixed cultures, most of them difficult to evaluate. conclusions: body surface sample advantages are: 1) the possibility of discarding a vertically transmitted infection. 2) quicker positive results than those in blood whenever liquid blood culture media are employed. 3) the possible identification of the etiologic agent when the mother has been given antibiotics intrapartum. 4). information about dangerous colonization without infection. in order not to lose  this useful information, but to save cost and effort, we advise that the number of surface cultures be reduced, keeping only es and ps?

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains. the result against strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  == in order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (mepm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mepm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from january, 1993 to december, 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1. the mic-range, 50% mic (mic50) and 90% mic (mic90) of mepm were equal to those of imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) against streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive or -resistant s. pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes which are gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and cefotaxime (ctx). 2. the mic-range,  mic50 and mic90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (mepm, ipm and papm) were different against escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae which are gram-negative strains. the mic90 of mepm was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those  of ipm and papm were 0.2 microgram/ml against e. coli. the mic90 of mepm was 0.1  microgram/ml, that of ipm was 25 micrograms/ml and that of papm was 6.25 micrograms/ml against h. influenzae. thus, the antimicrobial activity of mepm was stronger than those of ipm and papm. the mic90's of ipm and papm against h. influenzae were high with the mic of ipm at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the mic of papm at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 ipm-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. the mic90 of abpc was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of ctx was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of s. pneumoniae including 6 strains of pcg-insensitive or resistant s. pneumoniae. the mic90 of abpc and ctx were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. there were e. coli of 8 strains with abpc-high resistance (the mic of abpc was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which mic of ctx were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was found that 29.4% of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. it appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly mepm were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. mepm will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

AB  == background: identifying febrile children with invasive bacterial infection is difficult in the absence of telltale physical findings. urine latex agglutination (ula) tests have been used for rapid, on-site identification of such children. objectives: to study the performance of ula tests in identifying children with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group b streptococcus infection and to examine how the results of ula tests affect patient treatment. design: retrospective review. setting: urban children's hospital. patients: all emergency department and hospital patients tested by ula in 1990, excluding patients in the neonatal units. results: of 1629 patients, 36 had positive tests  (20 h influenzae, 5 s pneumoniae, and 11 group b streptococcus). thirteen of these were false positive based on culture results. although ula tests demonstrated excellent specificity, their sensitivity was poor. positive predictive values for bacteremia ranged from 0.346 to 0.600, and negative predictive values ranged from 0.972 to 0.997. the decision to treat with antibiotics was made before ula test results were available in 19 (53%) of the 36 patients with positive test results. of 1593 patients with negative test results, 1211 (76%) were admitted to the hospital, and approximately 81% were empirically  treated with parenteral antibiotics. conclusions: in clinical practice, treatment and disposition decisions are frequently made without regard to ula test results.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested pcr strategy.
AB  == primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16s rrna sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16s rrna genes of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the pcr assay was divided into two dna amplifications. the first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. the high specificity of the pcr assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). a total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the  diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. the assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. with agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the pcr products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) cfu/ml.

TI  == [epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  == in industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. the highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. in this range of age,  streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas haemophilus influenzae, neisseria  meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. h. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children  but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. n. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas s. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. detailed epidemiologic features of haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis  are provided.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == the effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b, escherichia coli, neisseria meningitis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. the directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and urine. the authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. they found that the sensitivity of the directigen test for detecting the five classic csf pathogens of children was 83.3% with csf  and 60% with urine specimens. in detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with csf and 37.5% with urine. thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and  emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine csf tests.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment and prevention of meningitis.
AB  == the efficacy of the conjugate polysaccharide h influenzae type b vaccine has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases of meningitis. physicians will manage fewer cases of meningitis but they must maintain skills in diagnosis and treatment of the cases that do occur. in addition, to a continuing experience with meningitis due to s pneumoniae and n meningitidis, physicians must be aggressive in obtaining materials for specific diagnosis of aseptic meningitis since many of the infections are treatable with antimicrobial agents. appropriate treatment of meningitis in children requires knowledge of agents for initial therapy, dosage schedules, changes in the regimen that may be required once the organism is isolated and results of susceptibility tests are available, knowledge of the drugs that require monitoring of serum concentrations to determine safety  and efficacy, and antimicrobial prophylaxis for contacts.

TI  == pcr primers and probes for the 16s rrna gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == management of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in developed countries the mortality from bacterial meningitis acquired outside the neonatal period is relatively low. in contrast, in developing countries it is often higher (20%-40%). in developed countries despite (and perhaps because of) the introduction of increasingly potent antimicrobials, the morbidity of bacterial meningitis has remained high. for example, up to 25% of patients with haemophilus influenzae meningitis have some form of neurological deficit. neisseria meningitidis is the major cause of bacterial meningitis in many areas of the world. a clone of group a meningococcus has spread from china to cause the most recent major epidemic in sub-saharan africa. group b meningococcal infections causing sporadic meningitis are increasing in parts of europe and south america. the mortality from meningococcal disease is greatest when there is a septicaemic component to the infection. although antimicrobial chemotherapy is  of major importance some adjuncts to therapy are beneficial. high dose corticosteroid therapy has been shown to decrease mortality in pneumococcal meningitis in an uncontrolled study and to speed recovery and decrease neurological sequelae in h. influenzae meningitis. nevertheless to prevent infection would be of greater benefit. prevention can be achieved by either chemoprophylaxis or immunoprophylaxis. although safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal, h. influenzae (hib) and groups a and c meningococcal meningitis; apart from the protein conjugate hib vaccine they are less effective in children under two years of age. there is no effective vaccine  to protect against group b meningococcal meningitis.

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

TI  == in vitro activity of ru 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester hr 916.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ru 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. the mics of ru 29246 for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml).  ru 29246 was active against staphylococcus aureus (mic90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). streptococci and neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to ru 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. ru 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem-1 and shv-1). however, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9) was detected. results of the study suggested that ru 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.

TI  == [basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  == meropenem (mepm), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. the results are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activity antibacterial activity of mepm against stock organisms including 31 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of listeria monocytogenes, 4 of bordetella pertussis and 3 of neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in mic90's, which  were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. mics against clinical isolates were as follows: in gram-positive bacteria, mics were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25  micrograms/ml against 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of streptococcus pneumoniae. in gram-negative bacilli, mics were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mic against 1 strain of peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025  micrograms/ml. 2. pharmacokinetics maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of mepm over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by hplc. urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. concentrations of mepm in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. in 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of mepm was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and  concentrations on days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on day 8 and was 2.8%. in another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of mepm was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. clinical efficacy clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  == flomoxef sodium (fmox) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a  bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6  micrograms/ml) and n.d. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. the urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. fmox was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected,  and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. in 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. the bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of escherichia coli,  and 2 strains of haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". moreover, the drug, administered with  or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. no side effects were observed in any of the patients. concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in got were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. the results suggest that fmox is useful and safe also in neonates.

TI  == direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a dna probe.
AB  == this study involved the rapid, direct identification of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus  sp., and streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (bactec, johnston laboratories, inc.) by using the accuprobe (gen-probe, san diego, calif.) culture confirmation test. this method uses a chemiluminescent dna probe  that detects the rrna of the target organisms. the manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. the first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml)  from the blood culture bottle. the second method used a microcentrifuge and less  volume (1 to 1.5 ml). a total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by accuprobe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. the microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. when combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the accuprobe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  == cefpirome (hr 810, cpr), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. plasma and urinary levels of cpr were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. the results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with cpr were investigated. cerebrospinal  fluid levels in a case of neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at  1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of  49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. these results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. these levels appear to be higher than mic90 values against escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. cpr was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute uti, totalling 61 cases. clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == cefixime shows good effects on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == there is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly  those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. in this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on group a and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. mics and the growth curves of 36 strains of group a streptococci and the effects of sub-mics on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. the results show that concerning the sub-mic cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with mic less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. concerning group b streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. in conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of group a.

TI  == opsonic effect of jacalin and human immunoglobulin a on type ii group b streptococci.
AB  == this study examined the effect of immunoglobulin a (iga) and the iga-binding lectin jacalin on the phagocytosis of type ii group b streptococci (gbs). strains possessing the trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant components of the c protein (ii/c) and type ii gbs lacking the c protein (ii) were examined by radiolabeled bacterial uptake, bactericidal assays, and electron microscopy. type ii/c gbs resisted phagocytosis by monocytes (4.9% +/- 0.8% uptake, mean +/- se, n = 25) compared with type ii gbs (8.5% +/- 1.4% uptake, n = 14, p = 0.03). phagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes was also less for the type ii/c strain 78-471 than for the type ii strain 79-176 (68% +/- 5% versus 86% +/-  4% reduction in cfu at 45 min, p = 0.03). iga binding did not explain the resistance of type ii/c gbs to phagocytosis. the uptake of type ii/c gbs was not  significantly different after opsonization in cord sera lacking endogenous iga (5.93% +/- 1.4%) than in the same cord sera after addition of exogenous iga (5.48% +/- 1.4%, p = 0.69, n = 9). attempts to remove serum iga with the iga-binding lectin jacalin resulted in the binding of iga-jacalin complexes to ii/c gbs. this combination of nonspecific iga and jacalin increased uptake of ii/c gbs from 4.9% +/- 0.8% to 11.8% +/- 1.9% (p = 0.002). jacalin also combined  with specific, immune, monoclonal iga bound to the surface of haemophilus influenzae and promoted the uptake of these bacteria. jacalin and iga mediated phagocytosis of ii/c gbs via receptors that were not dependent on divalent cations and that were not modulated by plating monocytes on antigen-antibody complexes.

TI  == sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in thai children at ramathibodi hospital.
AB  == hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (abr) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at ramathibodi hospital from january 1983 to december 1987. six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing  loss. among them, the causes of meningitis were: hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and escherichia coli (1 patient). various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, abr was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.

TI  == polyvalent group b streptococcal immune globulin for intravenous administration:  overview.
AB  == immunoglobulin therapy is becoming an important modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and viral infection. standard intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. however, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. since group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against gbs was prepared and studied. plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent gbs vaccine and was processed by the swiss red cross  for intravenous infusion. this high-titered gbs intravenous immunoglobulin (gbs-ivig) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard ivig. gbs-ivig provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. standard ivig did not protect animals against all gbs strains. however, gbs-ivig enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even  when the challenge dose of gbs was increased by 2 log units. specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of ivig.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, ampicillin and chloramphenicol was studied  at a reference laboratory against the isolates of the first 33 patients enrolled  in a pediatric swiss multicenter meningitis study. the predictive value of the mic data of 31 of the strains was further corroborated by two sets of bacterial killing curves in broth supplemented with 2 g/l of albumin. ceftriaxone had the lowest geometric mean mic values against all groups of isolates except for ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae. the bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone and that of ampicillin, alone and in combination with chloramphenicol, was compared at six times the respective mics and at pharmacologically readily achievable concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. the bactericidal power of ceftriaxone at six times the mic was as good or better than that of ampicillin alone or in combination against neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae despite the very low drug concentrations of ceftriaxone  compared to that of the competitors; and it was barely lower at six times the mic and at 1 mg/l (a level that is readily surpassed in csf at the 24 h trough level  after a single daily dose of ceftriaxone of 100 mg/kg (neonates 50 mg/kg) than that of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at much higher concentrations against haemophilus influenzae type b.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, and escherichia coli  were compared with those of ampicillin (abpc). sbtpc was superior to abpc especially against beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae, e. coli, s. aureus, and b. catarrhalis. 2. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (sbt) and abpc after administration of sbtpc fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. mean half-lives of sbt and abpc in  the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. mean urinary recovery rates of sbt and abpc in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. sbtpc  fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). the overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%.  4. no adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. these results indicate the usefulness of sbtpc fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == [microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. of the recent isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to rkm than to josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), erythromycin and lincomycin. also, macrolides  (mls)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to rkm. 2. recent isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, group g streptococci, s. pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to rkm than to midecamycin acetate and jm. oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. t1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first  6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. fifty-two patients with acute  upper and lower respiratory tract infections, campylobacter enteritis, etc. were  treated with rkm at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. an eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. a side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  == we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to  3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less  than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  == [the study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  == flomoxef (fmox; 6315-s), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. the activity of fmox against staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and mic was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. this mic value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. the distribution of mic's of fmox against escherichia coli and salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. serum concentrations of fmox after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours  after administration, respectively, and t1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg fmox were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, t1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. fmox was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. in these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. all bacterial species identified including branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with fmox. 4. only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated got and gpt, and 1 case of elevated gpt were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  == 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as  cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of staphylococcus aureus. ro 19-5247  was the only oral cephalosporin active against bordetella pertussis. it was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against haemophilus influenzae. in its activity against enterobacteria ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. only a few strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris and serratia marcescens were resistant to ro 19-5247 as were all strains of enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella ozaenae. ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against streptococcus pyogenes. there was no difference in the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  agalactiae. against haemophilus influenzae ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. the activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of ro 19-5247. ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.

TI  == safety and efficacy of once daily ceftriaxone for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == fifty-seven patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with once daily ceftriaxone. after an initial loading dose of 100 mg/kg, the patients received 80 mg/kg as a single daily dose. etiologic agents included: haemophilus influenzae type b, 37 (11 beta-lactamase-positive); neisseria meningitidis, 11; streptococcus pneumoniae, 6; streptococcus pyogenes, 1; haemophilus influenzae type f, 1; and group b streptococcus, 1. all patients showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal activity and drug concentrations were seen 24 hours after a dose even in those patients in whom repeat spinal taps were carried out following the  last dose of therapy. the drug was well-tolerated and the major adverse effect seen was diarrhea in 20.4% of the patients. the diarrhea was mild and self-limited and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug although it was  frequently associated with alterations in the stool microbiologic flora. based on this preliminary experience, ceftriaxone, when given in a single daily dose, appears safe and effective in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in nonneonatal infants and children.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == common bacterial pneumonitis in infants. determining the etiology and tailoring the treatment.
AB  == in infantile pneumonia, we recommend close attention to the history and physical  examination. baseline studies, including cbc, esr, blood cultures, and chest film, should be performed at onset and repeated as warranted. nasopharyngeal secretions or washings should be drawn by means of gentle suction and specimens sent for gram stain, fluorescent antibody stain for respiratory syncytial virus,  and culture for bacteria and for viruses if possible. acute and convalescent serum specimens should be obtained in serious cases to search for antibodies to rsv, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, and chlamydia. serum  and urine specimens may be collected for countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and latex agglutination testing for hemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, and if indicated, group b streptococcus. if deterioration continues and all tests are negative, the clinician should consider a more invasive procedure such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, needle aspiration, or open lung biopsy. while awaiting identification of the pathogen, the physician should  institute empiric therapy with optimum doses of antimicrobials and monitoring of  serum levels of drug. often the clinician is faced with deterioration and a negative workup. in this situation, other agents may be added, such as antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoan, and antituberculous agents, as well as various antibiotics, to cover rare and unusual pathogens. further consultation, even by phone, may at this point provide some insight into an otherwise confusing case.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

AB  == the mics and mbcs of cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) and ceftriaxone (ctrx) were determined in relation to 4 of the principal bacterial species which cause meningitis, i.e., s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, h. influenzae and e. coli. these tests were performed using final inocula of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. comparison was made with the mic and mbc values of benzylpenicillin (pcg) and ampicillin (abpc). 1. against 25 strains of s. pneumoniae, the mic 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: ctx, 0.05 and 0.024 micrograms/ml; des-ctx, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; ctrx, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively; and pcg, less than 0.012 micrograms/ml at both size. similarly, the mbc 90 values were: ctx, 0.01 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; des-ctx, 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; ctrx, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; and pcg, 0.024 and 0.012 micrograms/ml, respectively. it is thus apparent that pcg showed the lowest values for both the mic and mbc, followed by ctx, ctrx and then des-ctx. against 25 strains of s. agalactiae, the  mic 90 values with inocula of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: ctx, 0.05 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; des-ctx, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; ctrx, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and pcg, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. similarly, the mbc 90 values of des-ctx were 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, while the other 3 antibiotics showed the same values with both the 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml inocula: 0.10 micrograms/ml for ctx, 0.20 micrograms/ml for ctrx and 0.39 micrograms/ml for pcg. accordingly, ctx showed the lowest values, followed by ctrx and then pcg being about the same as des-ctx. against 25 strains of h. influenzae, the mic 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: ctx, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; des-ctx, 0.39 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; ctrx, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and abpc, 50 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. similarly, the mbc 90 values were: ctx, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; des-ctx, 1.56 and 1.56 micrograms/ml; ctrx, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; and abpc, greater than 100 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. accordingly, in terms of the mic 90, ctx and ctrx showed the same values, but in  terms of the mbc 90 ctx was superior.

TI  == an evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  == latex particle agglutination (lpa) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were haemophilus influenzae type b (hi b), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), streptococcus agalactiae (sa) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a and c. an  adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous lpa reagent was available. fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no lpa reagent was available. lpa was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease  in children.

TI  == quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. a total of 2,031 consecutive csf specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. we observed  that 85% of the total csf specimens positive for haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) cfu/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) cfu/ml. a correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the csf  and blood. for example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of h. influenzae greater than 10(3) cfu/ml in the csf, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) cfu/ml. it was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. the percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) cfu/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) cfu/ml. furthermore, a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the csf and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.

TI  == evaluation of the phadebact csf test for detection of the four most common causes of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == a five-center collaborative study was undertaken to determine the suitability of  the phadebact csf test kit and the phadebact group b streptococcus reagent for routine use by clinical laboratories to detect antigens of common organisms causing bacterial meningitis. the kits employ staphylococcal protein a coagglutination to detect the antigens of haemophilus influenzae types a, b, c, d, e, and f, neisseria meningitidis groups a, b, c, y, and w135, streptococcus pneumoniae (83 serotypes), and group b streptococcus. a total of 2,817 individual tests were performed on 577 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. the percent positive specimens detected by coagglutination was as follows: overall, 84%; h. influenzae, 97%; group b streptococcus, 75%; s. pneumoniae, 71%; and n. meningitidis, 58%. eighty-five of the specimens were also tested by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. coagglutination was more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis because it detected 74% of the positive specimens, whereas counterimmunoelectrophoresis detected only 65%. no false-positive results were obtained with coagglutination. the phadebact csf test kit is recommended for routine use in screening cerebrospinal fluid samples for antigens of the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis along with the gram stain and culture for  delayed confirmation of the rapid results.

TI  == antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  == microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative  organisms under conditions of near-neutral ph (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. susceptible species included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. streptococcus agalactiae, type 1a, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or s. agalactiae, type 3. bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

AB  == the cerebrospinal fluid of 589 subjects, 78 of whom were suffering from a purulent meningitis were examined. comparatively by classical bacteriological techniques (direct examination and culture) and by electro-immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, and limulus endotoxin assay. soluble bacterial haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis group a, c, and streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, were tested by electro-immunodiffusion and latex agglutination, and soluble bacterial n. meningitidis group b, listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus agalactiae antigens by electro-immunodiffusion. specific antigens and endotoxin were found in 75.8 per cent of the specimens with a rapid answer (120 min). the three tests revealed also only the diagnosis in 29.1 per cent of cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in 33.3 per cent of meningococcal meningitis and in 47 per cent of gram-negative bacteria meningitis. only five cerebrospinal fluid from the 589 specimens tested were given a non-specific reaction. these two advantages--sensitivity and specificity--of these three tests render them techniques of the future in the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.

TI  == antagonism of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for meningeal isolates of group b streptococci.
AB  == the increasing prevalence of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae type b has led to the recommendation that ampicillin and chloramphenicol be given as the initial therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis in infants and children. however, during the first 2 months of life, h. influenzae type b is a rare cause  of meningitis, whereas group b streptococcus is the most frequently isolated agent. since ampicillin and chloramphenicol have been shown to be antagonistic for other streptococci, an in vitro study of their effect on group b streptococci was performed. the effect of ampicillin and chloramphenicol, alone and in combination, on 18 meningeal isolates was determined for 2 different inocula of group b streptococci, using microtiter broth dilution and growth kinetic assays.  isoboles, fractional lethal concentration indices, or both indicated antagonism for all strains. growth kinetic assays for two representative strains demonstrated inhibition of the early bactericidal activity of ampicillin by chloramphenicol. these findings of in vitro antagonism suggest that this combination may be contraindicated for the treatment of infants with group b streptococcal meningitis.

AB  == threshold concentrations of streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, haemophilus influenzae type b, and streptococcus sp. group b type ib required for positive counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions were determined in vivo and in vitro. animals were infected intraperitoneally with various concentrations of microorganisms: adult mice with s. pneumoniae, suckling rats with h. influenzae,  and 3-week-old mice with streptococcus sp. group b. at 24 h after infection a minimum blood concentration of 10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml was needed for s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae before antigen was detected in the serum. a minimum concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml was needed for streptococcus sp. group b at 10 h after infection. larger threshold concentrations (10(4) cfu/ml for s. pneumoniae, 10(5) cfu/ml for h. influenzae, and 10(7) cfu/ml for streptococcus) were required in broth-grown cultures before cell-free antigens could be demonstrated by counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the medium. marked levels of antigen release by group b streptococci were observed as the cultures entered early stationary phase. this study provides evidence of a long-accepted, though poorly substantiated, hypothesis that a threshold concentration of microorganism  is necessary before counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions become positive. counterimmunoelecrophoresis results for clinical specimens should be interpreted  cautiously in light of this evidence.
