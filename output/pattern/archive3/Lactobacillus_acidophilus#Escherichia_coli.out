murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively. many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope. furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli. furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%; p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.
functional characterization of probiotic surface layer protein-carrying lactobacillus amylovorus strains.
background: adhesiveness to intestinal epithelium, beneficial immunomodulating effects and the production of pathogen-inhibitory compounds are generally considered as beneficial characteristics of probiotic organisms. we showed the potential health-promoting properties and the mechanisms of probiotic action of seven swine intestinal lactobacillus amylovorus isolates plus the type strain (dsm 20531t) by investigating their adherence to porcine intestinal epithelial cells (ipec-1) and mucus as well as the capacities of the strains to i) inhibit the adherence of escherichia coli to ipec-1 cells, ii) to produce soluble inhibitors against intestinal pathogens and iii) to induce immune signaling in dendritic cells (dcs). moreover, the role of the l. amylovorus surface (s) -layers - symmetric, porous arrays of identical protein subunits present as the outermost layer of the cell envelope - in adherence to ipec-1 cells was assessed using a novel approach which utilized purified cell wall fragments of the strains as carriers for the recombinantly produced s-layer proteins. results: three of the l. amylovorus strains studied adhered to ipec-1 cells, while four strains inhibited the adherence of e. coli, indicating additional mechanisms other than competition for binding sites being involved in the inhibition. none of the strains bound to porcine mucus. the culture supernatants of all of the strains exerted inhibitory effects on the growth of e. coli, salmonella, listeria and yersinia, and a variable, strain-dependent induction was observed of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human dcs. l. amylovorus dsm 16698 was shown to carry two s-layer-like proteins on its surface in addition to the major s-layer protein slpa. in contrast to expectations, none of the major s-layer proteins of the ipec-1 -adhering strains mediated bacterial adherence. conclusions: we demonstrated adhesive and significant pathogen inhibitory efficacies among the swine intestinal l. amylovorus strains studied, pointing to their potential use as probiotic feed supplements, but no independent role could be demonstrated for the major s-layer proteins in adherence to epithelial cells. the results indicate that many intestinal bacteria may coexist with and confer benefits to the host by mechanisms not attributable to adhesion to epithelial cells or mucus.
effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor contents in broilers.
this experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers. a total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex ross 308 broilers with an initial average bw of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (con), (2) con + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) con + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p1), and (4) con + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p2). broilers fed the p1 and p2 diets had greater bw gain than broilers fed the con diet during d 22 to 35 (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02). feed conversion ratios in p1 and p2 were decreased (p = 0.03) compared with that in con from d 22 to 35. ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of his and phe, were increased (p < 0.05) in p1 and p2 compared with con. serum iga and igm concentrations in p2 were higher (p < 0.05) than those in con. the cecal lactobacillus numbers were increased (p = 0.02), and the counts of escherichia coli were decreased (p = 0.03) in p1 and p2 compared with con. dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) the excreta nh3 content compared with the con. in conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity. furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of e. coli and decreased the nh3 content of excreta.
[effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
aim: study the effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. materials and methods: 9 h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, micrococcus luteus nctc 2665, escherichia coli state institute of standardization and control no 240367, lactobacillus acidophilus institute of cellular and intracellular symbiosis no 37 were used. ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of m. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of e. coli in endo medium and l. acidophilus--in mrs medium. results: decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. this effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against e. coli and decrease against l. acidophilus. the degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. conclusion: modification of lysozyme by h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
effects of clinoptilolite and modified clinoptilolite on the growth performance,  intestinal microflora, and gut parameters of broilers.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of natural clinoptilolite (ncli) and modified clinoptilolite (mcli) on broiler performance, gut morphology, and its relation to gut circumstances. a total of two hundred forty 1-d-old male chicks were randomly assigned to 3 treatments, each of which comprised 8 pens of 10 chicks per pen. birds in the control group were fed the basal diet, whereas those in the experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with ncli at 2% (ncli group) or mcli at 2% (mcli group) for 42 d. the results showed that compared with the control, supplementation with ncli or mcli had no significant (p > 0.05) effects on productive parameters from d 1 to 42. supplementation with mcli and ncli was associated with greater (p < 0.05) villus height in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those areas in the controls from d 1 to 42. however, supplementation with ncli and mcli had no significant (p > 0.05) influence on the crypt depth in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those in the controls. total viable counts of escherichia coli were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by mcli and ncli from d 1 to 21. the ncli and mcli significantly increased the total viable counts of lactobacillus acidophilus from d 22 to 42. small intestine and cecal ph values in the mcli group were found to be lower (p < 0.05) than those in other groups. total volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in both experimental groups from d 22 to 42. this study showed that ncli or mcli, as feed additives for broilers, had a positive effect on gut parameters by acting on microbial populations of the digestive tract.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7. the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af. tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157. the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342, isolated from the korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. the effects of l. acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; dmh) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. forty-five male f344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. the control group received a high-fat diet (hf), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (hfc), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and l. acidophilus kfri342 (hfcl). l. acidophilus kfri342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). l. acidophilus kfri342 treatments decreased the number of escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the hf and hfc treatments (p<0.05). l. acidophilus kfri342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in hfcl rats. therefore, l. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of dmh-induced symptoms in live rats. our in vivo studies indicate that l. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
background: probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. when administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. aims: to identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (in-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. to compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. materials and methods: burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in baghdad during august to november 2009. these swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. subcultures were performed on selective media. the necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates lacto. acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/ml) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. results: ninety different organisms were isolated. gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). however, the incidence of staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic streptococci was 4(4.4%). in susceptibility testing, lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. the coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. conclusion: the results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/ml had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. this indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.
effects of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on insulin sensitivity and the systemic inflammatory response in human subjects.
according to animal studies, intake of probiotic bacteria may improve glucose homeostasis. we hypothesised that probiotic bacteria improve insulin sensitivity by attenuating systemic inflammation. therefore, the effects of oral supplementation with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on insulin sensitivity and the inflammatory response were investigated in subjects with normal or impaired insulin sensitivity. in a double-blinded, randomised fashion, forty-five males with type 2 diabetes, impaired or normal glucose tolerance were enrolled and allocated to a 4-week treatment course with either l. acidophilus ncfm or placebo. l. acidophilus was detected in stool samples by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr. separated by the 4-week intervention period, two hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps were performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response was evaluated by subjecting the participants to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide injection (0.3 ng/kg) before and after the treatment course. l. acidophilus ncfm was detected in 75 % of the faecal samples after treatment with the probiotic bacterium. insulin sensitivity was preserved among volunteers in the l. acidophilus ncfm group, whereas it decreased in the placebo group. both baseline inflammatory markers and the systemic inflammatory response were, however, unaffected by the intervention. in conclusion, intake of l. acidophilus ncfm for 4 weeks preserved insulin sensitivity compared with placebo, but did not affect the systemic inflammatory response.
bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
association of lactobacillus acidophilus with mice peyer's patches.
objective: to clarify the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus to peyer's patches. methods: adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 to mice peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. the nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. the presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. the effect of l. acidophilus fn001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to peyer's patches was also studied. results: the adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of d-mannose and methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. pretreatment of l. acidophilus fn001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. l. acidophilus fn001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the l. acidophilus fn001 surface. in adhesion inhibition assay, l. acidophilus nf001, when applied to peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to peyer's patches. conclusion: l. acidophilus fn001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the peyer's patches. fn001 inhibits the adhesion of e. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit salmonella typhi and escherichia coli adherence to caco-2 cells.
a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells. three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. the inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01). the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
characterization of vaginal lactobacilli coaggregation ability with escherichia coli.
the coaggregation abilities of probiotic strains might enable it to form a barrier that prevents colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, the characterization of the coaggregation ability of 19 vaginal lactobacilli was studied. coaggregation ability of all lactobacilli with escherichia coli atcc 11229 was positive. only the highest coaggregation percentage of lactobacillus acidophilus s1 was obtained with e. coli atcc 11229 under both aerobic (71%) and anaerobic conditions (62%). the coaggregation abilities of strains occurred higher at acidic ph than at basic ph values. moreover, the coaggregation abilities of tested strains against e. coli decreased after heat treatment (70 or 85 degrees c). also, the relationship between hydrophobicity and coaggregation of strains was found to be significant. the effect of sonication, some enzymes (lipase and pepsin) and sodium periodate on coaggregation ability of l. acidophilus s1, which is one of the highest potentials on coaggregation ability, was investigated. sodium periodate did not have a significant effect on coaggregation ability of l. acidophilus s1. the sonicated cell showed lower coaggregation than the control, the supernatant fluid of this sonicated cells showed similar coaggregation ability to the control. coaggregation abilities of bacteriotherapeutic lactobacilli with pathogenic bacteria can be used for preliminary screening in order to identify potentially probiotic bacteria suitable for human use against urogenital tract infections.
released exopolysaccharide (r-eps) produced from probiotic bacteria reduce biofilm formation of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
here, we characterized released-exopolysaccharides (r-eps) from lactobacillus acidophilus a4 with the goal of identifying natural compounds that represses biofilm formation. in plastic 96-well microplates that contained 1.0 mg/ml of r-eps, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) biofilms were dramatically decreased by 87% and 94% on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (pvc) surfaces, respectively. in the presence of r-eps, neither their growth rate nor their autoinducer-2-like activity was affected on the ehec o157:h7. importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-eps was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. in addition, we found that adding r-eps significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csga, and csgb) and chemotaxis (chey) in transcriptome analysis. furthermore, these r-eps could prevent biofilm formation by a wide range of gram-negative and -positive pathogens. this property may lead to the development of novel food-grade adjuncts for microbial biofilm control.
inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.
dendritic cells from peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes differ from spleen dendritic cells in their response to commensal gut bacteria.
commensal gut bacteria have potent effects on the immune system, which are partially mediated by intestinal dendritic cells (dc). distinct commensals confer different properties to in vitro-generated dc. the aim of the present study was to reveal strain-dependent maturation patterns in primary dc. to this end, we compared the response of mouse peyer's patch (pp) dc, mesenteric lymph node (mln) dc and spleen dc to the commensal bacteria, bifidobacterium longum q46, lactobacillus acidophilus x37 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. bacterial maturation of dc occurred independently of tissue origin. expression of ccr7 and cd103 on the surface of mln dc, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory t cells, increased with stimulation by gram-positive commensals. bacteria-dependent cytokine production (il-6, il-10 and tnf-alpha) was similar in spleen and mln dc, and contaminant cells in these dc preparations produced ifn-gamma in response to l. acidophilus. in contrast, pp dc produced il-6 only in response to e. coli, little il-10 and no tnf-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by il-10 or tgf-beta. bifidobacteria downregulate il-6, tnf-alpha and il-12 production induced in in vitro-generated dc by l. acidophilus. similar inhibition was observed in splenic dc, but not in mln dc. mln cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher ifn-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.
functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
three lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic escherichia coli grown in vitro.
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. in this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among etec agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (scs) from healthy infant stool. only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal c2bbel (caco-2) cell line. isolate identification using api 50chl strips showed that they belonged to different lactobacillus species, i.e., lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4. the scs still had an inhibitory effect on etec after heating (100 degrees c, 15 min). the lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the ph of scs was adjusted to neutral (ph 7.2) to reduce the scs inhibitory effect. antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (lab)-scs with etec suspension. after 4h of co-culture, etec growth was inhibited. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2, l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4 could be used as an effective control for etec.
pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of e. coli o157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.
our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of escherichia coli o157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. the methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. the interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. there was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus np51 (npc 747) and propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. the effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of e. coli o157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. there were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. in general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. while the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to e. coli o157 that require further targeted research.
an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus lysates on the cytotoxic activity of shiga-like toxin 2 produced from escherichia coli o157:h7.
aims: the purpose of this study was to characterize the degree to which four cell lysates obtained from lactobacillus acidophilus strains affected the cytotoxic activity of escherichia coli o157:h7 in vitro and in vivo. methods and results: in a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding elisa assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of l. acidophilus a4 and 30sc (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. in particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of e. coli o157:h7, under the presence of the cell lysates of l. acidophilus a4, was observed by killing assay of caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. conclusions: according to our results, l. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of stx-2 produced from e. coli o157:h7. significance and impact of the study: the cell lysates of l. acidophilus can be applied to a variety of foods, and can be used as adjuncts for the inhibition of stx-2-mediated cytotoxicity.
comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions. the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized. these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek. these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
preinoculation with the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine citrobacter rodentium colitis.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (a/e) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium causes a similar a/e lesion in the murine intestine. like epec, c. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. two-week old balb/c mice were inoculated with l. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before c. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to c. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. the probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. we observed that l. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits c. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in c. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity. probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), interleukin (il)-10]. preinoculation with l. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal iga secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6, and il-12]. these observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. this study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. these oral administration of lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3. when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of the ccl4 control group, respectively. these lactic acid bacteria also showed the potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice. the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.
reduction of escherichia coli o157 in finishing beef cattle by various doses of lactobacillus acidophilus in direct-fed microbials.
our objective was to evaluate the effects of three doses of lactobacillus acidophilus strain np51 and a combination treatment of strains np51 and np45 on prevalence of escherichia coli o157 in cattle. three hundred steers were assigned randomly to 60 pens (five steers per pen) and received one of five treatments: (i) control, no added direct-fed microbial; (ii) hnp51, high dose of np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer daily; (iii) mnp51, np51 at 10(8) cfu per steer daily; (iv) lnp51, low dose of np51 at 10(7) cfu per steer daily; and (v) np51+45, np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer daily and np45 at 106 cfu per steer daily. all direct-fed microbial treatments included propionibacterium freudenreichii at 10(9) cfu per steer. individual rectal fecal samples were collected on arrival and every 28 days throughout the feeding period. fecal and hide samples were collected on the day of harvest. samples were analyzed for presence of e. coli o157 using immunomagnetic separation methods. cattle receiving hnp51, mnp51, and lnp51 had a lower prevalence (p < 0.01) of e. coli o157 throughout the feeding period compared with the controls, and the dose response for np51 was a linear decrease in prevalence with increasing dose (p < 0.01). no decrease in prevalence for cattle receiving the combination np51+45 was detected compared with controls (p = 0.15). e. coli o157 prevalences averaged across collection times were 23.9, 10.5, 9.9, 6.8, and 17.3% for cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51 +45 groups, respectively. least squares mean estimates of fecal prevalence at harvest of e. coli o157 were 31.7, 12.5, 17.4, 8.2, and 41.6% among cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51+45 groups, respectively. least squares mean estimates of the percentage of positive hide samples at harvest were 8.7, 5.9, 4.8, 3.4, and 8.6% among cattle in the control, lnp51, mnp51, hnp51, and np51+45 groups, respectively. the greatest decrease in e. coli o157 carriage was achieved using np51 at 10(9) cfu per steer.
[in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.
growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
in vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
a series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium. none of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. however, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of e. coli o157:h7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. in coculture experiments of b. infantis and e. coli, the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. these results suggest that lactoferrin in iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.
lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis and lactobacillus f19 prevent antibiotic-associated ecological disturbances of bacteroides fragilis in the intestine.
objective: the objective of this study was to compare the effect of clindamycin on the intestinal microflora in subjects ingesting yogurt with added probiotic microorganisms with the microflora in subjects ingesting placebo yogurt. materials and methods: twenty-four healthy subjects were included in the study. all subjects received 150 mg clindamycin four times daily for 7 days and 250 ml yogurt twice daily for 14 days. faecal samples were collected before, during and after administration of clindamycin. results: in the aerobic intestinal microflora, the numbers of enterococci increased after treatment in both groups, whereas other gram-positive microorganisms decreased. in both groups, the numbers of escherichia coli also decreased, whereas there was a concomitant increase in numbers of other gram-negative bacilli. in the anaerobic microflora in subjects receiving yogurt with added microorganisms, the numbers of lactobacilli and bacteroides remained at the same levels throughout the study, whereas the numbers decreased in the placebo group. other anaerobic bacteria decreased in both groups. the minimum inhibitory concentration of clindamycin against strains of bacteroides increased in both groups during the study. conclusions: the probiotic microorganisms evaluated in this study prevented ecological disturbances in the numbers of intestinal bacteroides fragilis group species during clindamycin administration.
growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus. these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7, the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (dfms) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. steers were evaluated for shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the dfms, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the dfms were fed. gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. lactobacillus acidophilus npc 747 decreased (p < 0.01) the shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. e. coli o157:h7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving l. acidophilus npc 747. in addition, dfm supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the number of e. coli o157:h7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the dfm supplementation period did not differ among treatments. gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (p < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two dfm treatments than for control animals. the results of this study suggest that the feeding of a lactobacillus-based dfm to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
in this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (phema) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (phema-20% dmaema), polyurethane (pu), polypropylene (pp), poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (plga), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (bhk 21) cells and epithelial madine darby kidney (mdbk) cells. biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. the bacteria used were; escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus acidophilus b-13. initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. the adhesion behaviour of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. however, the percentage of attached e. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while l. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. the comparative results indicated that the adhesion of bhk and mdbk cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic phema surface and highest on the most hydrophobic pp surface. in contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.
selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis, b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.
inhibition of in vitro growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 by probiotic lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
the inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. the species such as lactobacillus casei strain shirota or l. acidophilus yit 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on stec. the ph value and undissociated lactic acid (u-la) concentration of the culture medium of stec cocultured with l. casei or l. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. the cytotoxic properties of u-la on stec strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mm) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mm). these data suggest that the bactericidal effect of lactobacillus on stec depends on its lactic acid production and ph reductive effect.
lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
[the antagonistic activity of the eubiotic maxilin towards wound infection and its effect on the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms].
antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain n 2585 of "maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. coli, candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains s. aureus, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. the studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains candida most actively, followed by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli. the use of "maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. the sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. it was revealed that "maxilin" probiotic affects ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less st. aureus and e. coli. the extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801.
lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801, with an estimated molecular mass of less than 6.5 kda. it displays a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only related lactobacilli but including the gram-negative pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli row and salmonella panama 1467) with a bactericidal activity. the antimicrobial activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid was insensitive to catalase but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, proteinase k and pronase, heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees c), and maintained in a wide ph range. the proteinaceous compound was isolated from cell-free culture supernatant fluid and purified. crude bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellicle after ammonium sulphate precipitation (40% saturation) and partially purified by extraction/precipitation with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). further purification to homogeneity was performed by reversed phase fast performance liquid chromatography. the amino acid composition was determined. amino acid sequencing revealed that the n-terminal end was blocked.
growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm: an experimental study.
effects of intestinal microflora on the development of colonic neoplasm induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) were observed using conventionalized and gnotobiotic mouse models. the incidence of colonic adenoma in germ-free mice (iqi/jic) (gf), mice conventionalized after dmh injection (cvz-post-dmh) and conventionalized mice (cvz, conventionalized before dmh injection) was 74%, 69% and 58%, respectively. the mean number of adenomas per mouse in the three groups was 2.6, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. however, the adenoma in cvz was larger than in gf. the incidence of adenoma in mice mono-associated with mitsuokella multiacida, clostridium butyricum, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium paraputrificum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus was 68%, 68%, 63%, 50%, 50% and 30%, respectively. however, the adenoma in the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was larger than in gf. faecal ph in cvz and the l. acidophilus group was significantly lower than in gf. the deconjugation rate of faecal bile acids in cvz, the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was significantly higher than in gf. these findings suggested two different effects of microflora on the development of dmh-induced adenoma: either an inhibition of the incidence of adenoma or a promotion of tumour growth. effects of l. acidophilus may be mediated by faecal ph and effects of cl. paraputrificum and cl. butyricum by deconjugated bile acids.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
a probiotic fermented pcmt food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (pcmt 2:1:1:1, w/w) with lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees c for 24 h. such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhosa and e. coli. a significant decline in ph with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from e. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. the counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of e. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. the beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by l. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from e. coli. the cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26  are colinear products of a single gene.
three of the four deoxynucleoside kinases required for growth of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26 exist as heterodimeric pairs specific for deoxyadenosine (dak) and deoxycytidine (dck) or dak and deoxyguanosine (dgk). however, only two tandem genes, dak/dgk, are found, and are expressed only as dak/dgk in transformed escherichia coli. sequencing peptides spanning 63% of the native dck subunit revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from dgk (beginning mtvivl...), except that dck lacks residues 2 and 3 (dck is m..ivl; dgk is .tvivl). also, mass spectrometry indicates that native dck and dgk subunits are identical in mass adjusted for the first three residues. furthermore, the native enzymes have identical isoelectric ph values, indicating an equal number of charged residues. to enable e. coli to express peptide having the native dck sequence, codons 2 and 3 were deleted from the dgk portion of the tandem genes, resulting in expression of protein having the specificities and regulatory properties of native dak/dck, including heterotropic stimulation of dak activity by deoxycytidine or dctp (not deoxyguanosine or dgtp) and end-product inhibition of the respective activities by datp and dctp. subcloning normal and mutant dgk yielded homodimeric dgk and dck, respectively. the dck homodimer strongly resembles human dck, with a low k(m) for deoxycytidine, the ability to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at much higher k(m) values, and end-product inhibition by dctp. thus two distinct and specific enzymes evidently are derived from a single lactobacillus gene. the mechanism by which this occurs in vivo has yet to be elucidated.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
cloning and expression of the heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26.
two uniquely paired deoxynucleoside kinases, deoxycytidine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase (dck/dak) and deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (dgk/dak) are required, together with thymidine kinase (tk), for deoxynucleotide synthesis in lactobacillus acidophilus r-26. using polymerase chain reaction-generated probes based on n-terminal amino acid sequences, we have cloned tandem genes for 25- and 26-kda polypeptides, whose derived amino acid sequences and size correspond to wild-type lactobacillus enzyme subunits. expression in escherichia coli uses a single endogenous promoter and yields active dgk/dak (approximately 3% of extracted protein) closely resembling wild-type dgk/dak in specificity, kinetics, heterotropic activation, and end product inhibition. alignment of cloned genes reveals 65% identity in their dna sequences and 61% identity in derived amino acid sequences. comparison with herpes-viral tks reveals three conserved regions: glycine- and arginine-rich atp-binding motifs and a d/e-r-s/h motif at the putative tk deoxynucleoside site. greater homology, however, is seen upon multiple alignment of dgk with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases, yielding the consensus sequence-d/e-r-s-i/v-y-x-d-.dgk also shares a sequence (-y-d-p-t-i/l-e-d-s/y-y-) required for gtp hydrolysis by p21ras.
lactobacillus acidophilus la 1 binds to cultured human intestinal cell lines and  inhibits cell attachment and cell invasion by enterovirulent bacteria.
four human lactobacillus acidophilus strains were tested for their ability to adhere onto human enterocyte like caco-2 cells in culture. the la 1 strain exhibited a high calcium independent adhesive property. this adhesion onto caco-2 cells required a proteinaceous adhesion promoting factor, which was present in the spent bacterial broth culture supernatant. la 1 strain also strongly bound to the mucus secreted by the homogeneous cultured human goblet cell line ht29-mtx. the inhibitory effect of la 1 organisms against caco-2 cell adhesion and cell invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. as a result, the following dose dependent inhibitions were obtained: (a) against the cell association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium; (b) against the cell invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium. incubations of l acidophilus la 1 before and together with enterovirulent e coli were more effective than incubation after infection by e coli.
adhering heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lb, inhibits the process of pathogenicity of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in cultured human intestinal cells.
heat-killed l. acidophilus, strain lb, was tested for its ability to adhere in vitro onto human enterocyte-like caco-2 and muco-secreting ht29-mtx cells in culture. the heat-killed lb bacteria exhibited a high adhesive property. a diffuse pattern of adhesion was observed to the undifferentiated cells, the apical brush border of the enterocytic cells, and to the mucus layer that covered the surface of the mucus-secreting cells. the inhibitory effect of heat-killed lb organisms against the human intestinal caco-2 cell-adhesion and cell-invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. the following dose-dependent inhibitions were obtained: (i) against the cell-association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely-adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium; (ii) against the cell-invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium.
antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal caco-2 cells by lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb decreases bacterial invasion.
salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells in culture, whereas yersinia pseudotuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated caco-2 cells. all these enterovirulent strains invaded the caco-2 cells. using a heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria. living and heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb inhibited both cell association and invasion of caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.
competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture. heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
effects of the spermicidal agent nonoxynol-9 on vaginal microbial flora.
the use of nonoxynol-9--containing vaginal contraceptive preparations increases vaginal (and urethral) colonization by escherichia coli. nonoxynol-9 is toxic to various microorganisms, including lactobacillus acidophilus, but has little or no direct effect on e. coli. l. acidophilus, which is present in the vaginas of most normal women, generates h2o2 which, when combined with peroxidase and a halide, was toxic to e. coli. this toxicity was inhibited by nonoxynol-9 due to the selective destruction of the lactobacilli. in contrast, at higher concentrations, nonoxynol-9 was toxic to e. coli when combined with peroxidase and a halide. this toxicity was shared with certain other nonionic detergents and was due to the formation of peroxides in the preparations on prolonged exposure to oxygen. e. coli colonization may, in part, reflect the balance between these opposing effects of nonoxynol-9 on the vaginal antimicrobial system. further, damage to normal tissues by peroxides in nonoxynol-9 preparations needs to be considered.
cloning, phenotypic expression, and dna sequence of the gene for lactacin f, an antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus spp.
lactacin f is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088. a 63-mer oligonucleotide probe deduced from the n-terminal lactacin f amino acid sequence was used to clone the putative laf structural gene from plasmid dna of a lactacin f-producing transconjugant, l. acidophilus t143. one clone, nck360, harbored a recombinant plasmid, ptrk160, which contained a 2.2-kb ecori fragment of the size expected from hybridization experiments. an escherichia coli-l. acidophilus shuttle vector was constructed, and a subclone (ptrk162) containing the 2.2-kb ecori fragment was introduced by electroporation into two lactacin f-negative strains, l. acidophilus 89 and 88-c. lactobacillus transformants containing ptrk162 expressed lactacin f activity and immunity. bacteriocin produced by the transformants exhibited an inhibitory spectrum and heat stability identical to those of the wild-type bacteriocin. an 873-bp region of the 2.2-kb fragment was sequenced by using a 20-mer degenerate lactacin f-specific primer to initiate sequencing from within the lactacin f structural gene. analysis of the resulting sequence identified an open reading frame which could encode a protein of 75 amino acids. the 25 n-terminal amino acids for lactacin f were identified within the open reading frame along with an n-terminal extension, possibly a signal sequence. the lactacin f n-terminal sequence, through the remainder of the open reading frame (57 amino acids; 6.3 kda), correlated extremely well with composition analyses of purified lactacin f which also predicted a size of 51 to 56 amino acid residues. molecular characterization of lactacin f identified a small hydrophobic peptide that may be representative of a common bacteriocin class in lactic acid bacteria.
impact of lactobacillus acidophilus on the normal intestinal microflora after administration of two antimicrobial agents.
twenty healthy volunteers participated in a comparative study concerning the influence of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the normal intestinal microflora after the administration of two antimicrobial agents, enoxacin and clindamycin, respectively. l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml to ten of the volunteers immediately after the administration of the antimicrobial agents. on the seventh day of enoxacin administration enterobacteria were eliminated in nine of ten subjects. enterococci disappeared or decreased significantly in five subjects. during the l. acidophilus supplementation, there was a significant increase in the number of escherichia coli in one subject, while enterococci returned to the same level as before enoxacin administration in all subjects.
influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.
in vivo inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic escherichia coli in vivo. twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. one treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with l. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic e. coli with subsequent dosing with l. acidophilus. the other treatment consisted of challenging with the e. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with l. acidophilus. statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with l. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with e. coli. also, continued dosing with l. acidophilus lowered the ph in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given l. acidophilus or e. coli. this strain of l. acidophilus was capable of competing with e. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.
