TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == antistaphylococcal action of lacto- and bifidobacteria and interleukn-2.
AB  == antistaphylococcal action of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281, l. acidophilus lmv b-7279 and bifidobacterium animalis vkb as well as interleukin-2 (il-2) has been determined on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in mice. it has been established that peroral administration of certain probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria or composition l. acidophilus lmv b-7279--l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281 with il-2 to mice favored the reducing of terms of staphylococcus persistence in the kidneys of experimental mice. the studied schemes are promising for treatment of patients with surgical infection.

TI  == the effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria in monoculture on the vaginal microflora  in norm and in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  == the influence of probiotic strains of lactobacillus casei imv b-7280, lactobacillus acidophilus imv b-7279, bifidobacterium animalis vkl, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281 and bifidobacterium animalis vkb, each strain separately, to the range of the urogenital tract microflora in physiological norm and in cases of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of  mice induced by staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. it was found that all these strains had different efficiency in staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 growth suppression in the vagina of infected mice and affect the spectrum of microorganisms. lactobacillus casei imv b-7280 strain had effective antistaphylococcal effect and reduced the number of coliform bacteria and fungi in the vagina in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice. lactobacillus casei imv b-7280 strain is promising to create probiotic drugs effective in treating intravaginal staphylococcosis.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == [isolation and characterization of vaginal lactobacilli producing hydrogen peroxide].
AB  == aim: isolation and characteristics of vaginal lactobacilli that actively generate h2o2 and have high antagonistic activity. materials and methods: staphylococcus aureus 8956, escherichia coli 8852, klebsiella pneumoniae 8795 and candida albicans 5646 were used as target-strains. skim milk and mrs medium were used for lactobacilli isolation and cultivation. antagonism was studied in complete agar and saburo medium. merckoquant peroxide test (merck) stripes were used for the determination of h2o2. antibacterial activity was determined by diffusion into agar. specific culture growth rate was determined by conventional method, acidification of the culture medium--by ph-meter. results: 12 strains were isolated from vaginal smears of healthy women. these strains have an ability to ferment milk among which a highly active h2o2 producer was isolated and attributed to lactobacillus delbrueckii by the results of 16s rrna and alpha-subunit rna polymerase gene sequence analysis (16s rdna and rpoa genes are  registered in genbank, numbers hq379171 and hq379180 respectively). l. delbrueckii mh-10 bacterial cells were characterized by specific growth speed 1.26 per hour, reaching a maximum titer of 2 x 10(9) pfu/ml with lowering medium  ph to 4.0. under aerated conditions h2o2 concentration reached 100 microg/ml or more. l. delbrueckii mh-10 has high antibacterial activity against s. aureus, e.  coli, k. pneumoniae. conclusion: l. delbrueckii mh-10 isolate is an active h2o2 producer, has high growth speed and broad antibacterial activity spectrum, is a perspective candidate for the development of probiotic preparation for the prophylaxis and therapy of vaginoses.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus thermophilus two-component systems: in silico analysis, functional analysis and expression of response regulator genes in pure  or mixed culture with its yogurt partner, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) is widely  used in the dairy industry. as a food bacterium, it has to cope with changing environments such as milk, yogurt, as well as the digestive tract, after the product has been ingested. in bacteria, two-component systems (tcs) are one of the most prevalent mechanisms to sense and respond appropriately to a wide range  of signals. they are typically composed of a sensor kinase (hk) that detects a stimulus and a response regulator (rr) which acts as a transcriptional regulator. our objective was to make an inventory of the tcs present in s. thermophilus lmd-9 and investigate the contribution of each tcs to lmd-9 growth in milk. for that purpose, we performed in silico, transcriptomic as well as functional analysis. the lmd-9 genome presented 6 complete tcs with both hk and rr (tcs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and 2 orphan rrs (rr01 and 08) with truncated hk. our in silico analysis revealed that for 5 tcs out of the 8, orthologs with known functions were found in other bacterial species whereas for tcs02, 4 and 6 the function of the orthologs are unidentified. transcriptomic studies (using quantitative pcr) revealed that all s. thermophilus lmd-9 response regulator genes were expressed in milk; they were expressed at different levels and with different profiles during growth. in mixed culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), the s. thermophilus partner in yogurt, the expression of four s. thermophilus lmd-9 response regulator increased; two of them, rr02 and rr09, increased by a factor of 6. these results indicate that the  presence of l. bulgaricus induces regulatory changes in s. thermophilus. we also  demonstrated that a response regulator (rr02) can exert its regulatory function on its target genes even when expressed at very low levels. we showed that rr05-an ortholog of bacillus subtilis yycf or staphylococcus aureus walr-was essential for the growth of s. thermophilus. for the 7 other rrs, the absence of  a single response regulator gene was insufficient to notably impact the growth of lmd-9 in milk, with or without supplementation with purines, formate, or stress agents (lactate, h(2)o(2)). we demonstrated here that the 8 response regulators of lmd-9 are expressed--and thus potentially active--during growth in milk and suggested that the response regulators have possibly overlapping regulons and/or  functions not essential under the conditions tested.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == two self-splicing group i introns interrupt two late transcribed genes of prolate-headed lactobacillus delbrueckii phage jcl1032.
AB  == two group i introns were detected from the late gene region of the prolate-headed phage jcl1032 of lactobacillus delbrueckii. introns jcl-i1 and jcl-i2 interrupt orf602 and orf1868 encoding a phage terminase large subunit (terl, 69.7 kda) and  a putative tape measure protein (tmp, 202 kda), respectively. the introns jcl-i1  (226 bp) and jcl-i2 (322 bp) were efficiently self-spliced in vivo. both introns  were classified to the subgroup ia1 having all the conserved structures necessary for splicing, but lacking the ability to encode endonucleases or other gene products. the introns jcl-i1 and jcl-i2 shared restricted nucleotide sequence similarity with each other and with the group i terl intron of lb. delbrueckii phage ll-h. no match was found for jcl-i1 in the homology searches. instead, the  primary sequence from the joining region of p8 and p7 to p9 of the intron jcl-i2  was homologous to the group i intron of bacillus mojavensis; the orf142 introns i1, i2 and i3 of staphylococcus aureus phage twort; the group i intron of phage bastille (bacillus thuringiensis); and to the group ia3 intron of monomastix species.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == a rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal dna from lactobacillus species and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic dna from various gram-positive bacteria. species tested included lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797, lact. acidophilus n2, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, propionibacterium jensenii p126, bacillus pumilus and enterococcus faecalis. our technique for chromosomal dna isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. isolated dna is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning,  polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.

TI  == behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  == the ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type a and b producers staphylococcus aureus strains (atcc 6538, s6, fri-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) cfu/ml of s. aureus and with about 10(6) cfu of starter culture, and  incubated at 42 degrees c during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees c. samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. viable count of lactic acid bacteria and s. aureus as well as ph, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (tnase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea) production were evaluated. behavior of four strains was similar; s. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with lab, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. tnase and sea  production were positive in all samples taken along the study. it was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of s. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after  several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low ph. even though s. aureus was inhibited, tnase and sea were demonstrable along the storage. therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  == a novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. the producer strain was identified by molecular  typing to belong to the species lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. the inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. its sensitivity to amylolitic  enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. the amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. the bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kda) by three different methods: hplc gel-filtration, sds-page and amino acid contents.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
