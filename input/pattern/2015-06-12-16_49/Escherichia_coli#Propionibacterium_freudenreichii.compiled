TI  - A riboswitch sensor to determine vitamin B12 in fermented foods.
AB  - We describe a sensitive and selective method for determination of vitamin B12 content in fermented foods using riboswitch sensor. A riboswitch amplicon from Propionibacterium freudenreichii was cloned in p519NGFP vector in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expression of green fluorescence protein was revers correlated to the concentrations of adenosylcobalamin. Adenosylcobalamin directly binds to riboswitch region leading to conformational changes in the secondary structure of mRNA, thus inhibiting expression. After various examinations, a standard curve was obtained from 10 to 1000 ng/mL of cyanocobalamin. The limit of determination is 10 ng/mL. The inter-assay coefficients of variation were 7.5% for the range of 10-1000 ng/mL. The recovery of this method was 92.3%. This method has no or less responses to nucleic acid, pseudovitamin B12, vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor and haptocorrin. The riboswitch sensor results were similar with HPLC, but they were Ca. 24% lower than the microbiological assay results.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Propionibacterium freudenreichii: effect of expressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase on propionic acid production.
AB  - Propionic acid is currently produced mainly via petrochemicals, but there is increasing interest in its fermentative production from renewable biomass. However, the current propionic acid fermentation process suffers from low product yield and productivity. In this work, the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) was cloned from Escherichia coli and expressed in Propionibacterium freudenreichii. PPC catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate with the fixation of one CO2. Its expression in P. freudenreichii showed profound effects on propionic acid fermentation. Compared to the wild type, the mutant expressing the ppc gene grew significantly faster, consumed more glycerol, and produced propionate to a higher final titer at a faster rate. The mutant also produced significantly more propionate from glucose under elevated CO2 partial pressure. These effects could be attributed to increased CO2 fixation and resulting changes in the flux distributions in the dicarboxylic acid pathway.
TI  - The use of direct-fed microbials to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in beef cattle: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Human illness due to infections with Escherichia coli O157 is a serious health concern. Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM - OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 10(9) CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.
TI  - Variable efficacy of a vaccine and direct-fed microbial for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7 in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of a type-III secreted proteins vaccine and a Lactobacillus-acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (DFM) for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7, cattle (n=864) were allocated to the following groups: DFM, finishing diets containing 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU)/animal/day L. acidophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii; VAC, finishing diets and 2 mL intramuscular injection of vaccine at allocation and 28 days later; or CON, finishing diets only. Cattle within replicates were stratified by initial levels of E. coli O157:H7 and randomized to experimental groups, with 30 pens allocated on June 15, 2011 (AS1), 18 pens allocated on June 28, 2011 (AS2), and 18 cattle per pen. Rectal fecal samples and perineal swabs were collected at 28-day intervals until shipment to slaughter (103-145 days on trial). Numbers of cattle with enumerable E. coli O157:H7 (>/=1.6 CFU/g feces) were reduced in AS1 and AS2 by VAC (p=0.008), although interventions had no impact on numbers of E. coli O157:H7 shed. For AS1, VAC reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.04) in the feeding period but not at shipment to slaughter. For AS2, prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 was not reduced in either feces or perineal swabs by VAC at any time. For AS1, DFM reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in perineal swabs (p=0.01) during the feeding period. For AS2, DFM increased E. coli O157:H7 detection in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.01) at shipment to slaughter. Seventy-five percent of AS1 E. coli O157:H7 isolates had only stx1, while 87% of AS2 isolates had stx1 and stx2 genes. Of the two interventions, VAC shows the most potential for pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7, but due to variable efficacy of both DFM and VAC, additional product development is necessary to ensure more consistent pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Escherichia coli O26 in feedlot cattle: fecal prevalence, isolation, characterization, and effects of an E. coli O157 vaccine and a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - Escherichia coli O26 is second only to O157 in causing foodborne, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections. Our objectives were to determine fecal prevalence and characteristics of E. coli O26 in commercial feedlot cattle (17,148) that were enrolled in a study to evaluate an E. coli O157:H7 siderophore receptor and porin (SRP((R))) vaccine (VAC) and a direct-fed microbial (DFM; 10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]/animal/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) CFU/animal/day of Propionibacterium freudenreichii). Cattle were randomly allocated to 40 pens within 10 complete blocks; pens were randomly assigned to control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM treatments. Vaccine was administered on days 0 and 21, and DFM was fed throughout the study. Pen-floor fecal samples (30/pen) were collected weekly for the last 4 study weeks. Samples were enriched in E. coli broth and subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to detect O26-specific wzx gene and four major virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxA) and to a culture-based procedure that involved immunomagnetic separation and plating on MacConkey agar. Ten presumptive E. coli colonies were randomly picked, pooled, and tested by the multiplex PCR. Pooled colonies positive for O26 serogroup were streaked on sorbose MacConkey agar, and 10 randomly picked colonies per sample were tested individually by the multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli O26 was higher (p<0.001) by the culture-based method compared to the PCR assay (22.7 versus 10.5%). The interventions (VAC and or DFM) had no impact on fecal shedding of O26. Serogroup O26 was recovered in pure culture from 23.9% (260 of 1089) of O26 PCR-positive pooled colonies. Only 7 of the 260 isolates were positive for the stx gene and 90.1% of the isolates possessed an eaebeta gene that codes for intimin subtype beta, but not the bfpA gene, which codes for bundle-forming pilus. Therefore, the majority of the O26 recovered from feedlot cattle feces was atypical enteropathogenic E. coli, and not STEC.
TI  - Development of a Propionibacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector for metabolic  engineering of Propionibacterium jensenii, an efficient producer of propionic acid.
AB  - Propionic acid (PA) is an important chemical building block and is widely applied for organic synthesis, food, feedstuff, and pharmaceuticals. To date, the strains that can efficiently produce PA have included Propionibacterium thoenii, P. freudenreichii, and P. acidipropionici. In this report, we show that P. jensenii ATCC 4868 is also able to produce PA in much higher yields than the previously reported strains. To further improve the production capacity, a P. jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector was developed for the metabolic engineering of P. jensenii. Specifically, a 6.9-kb endogenous plasmid, pZGX01, was isolated from P. acidipropionici ATCC 4875 and sequenced. Since the sequencing analysis indicated that pZGX01 could encode 11 proteins, the transcriptional levels of the corresponding genes were also investigated. Then, a P. jensenii-Escherichia coli shuttle vector was constructed using the pZGX01 plasmid, the E. coli pUC18 plasmid, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene. Interestingly, not only could the developed shuttle vector be transformed into P. jensenii ATCC 4868 and 4870, but it also could be transformed into freudenreichii ATCC 6207 subspecies of P. freudenreichii. Finally, the glycerol dehydrogenase gene (gldA) from Klebsiella pneumoniae was expressed in P. jensenii ATCC 4868 with the constructed shuttle vector. In a 3-liter batch culture, the PA production by the engineered P. jensenii ATCC 4868 strain reached 28.23 +/- 1.0 g/liter, which was 26.07% higher than that produced by the wild-type strain (22.06 +/- 1.2 g/liter). This result indicated that the constructed vector can be used a useful tool for metabolic engineering of P. jensenii.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Propionibacterium freudenreichii for n-propanol production.
AB  - Propionibacteria are widely used in industry for manufacturing of Swiss cheese, vitamin B(1)(2), and propionic acid. However, little is known about their genetics and only a few reports are available on the metabolic engineering of propionibacteria aiming at enhancing fermentative production of vitamin B12 and propionic acid. n-Propanol is a common solvent, an intermediate in many industrial applications, and a promising biofuel. To date, no wild-type microorganism is known to produce n-propanol in sufficient quantities for industrial application purposes. In this study, a bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) was cloned from Escherichia coli and expressed in Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The mutants expressing the adhE gene converted propionyl- coenzyme A, which is the precursor for propionic acid biosynthesis, to n-propanol. The production of n-propanol was limited by NADH availability, which was improved significantly by using glycerol as the carbon source. Interestingly, the improved propanol production was accompanied by a significant increase in propionic acid productivity, indicating a positive effect of n-propanol biosynthesis on propionic acid fermentative production. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on producing n-propanol by metabolically engineered propionibacteria, which offers a novel route to produce n-propanol from renewable feedstock, and possibly a new way to boost propionic acid fermentation.
TI  - Trends in bacterial trehalose metabolism and significant nodes of metabolic pathway in the direction of trehalose accumulation.
AB  - The current knowledge of trehalose biosynthesis under stress conditions is incomplete and needs further research. Since trehalose finds industrial and pharmaceutical applications, enhanced accumulation of trehalose in bacteria seems advantageous for commercial production. Moreover, physiological role of trehalose is a key to generate stress resistant bacteria by metabolic engineering. Although trehalose biosynthesis requires few metabolites and enzyme reactions, it appears to have a more complex metabolic regulation. Trehalose biosynthesis in bacteria is known through three pathways--OtsAB, TreYZ and TreS. The interconnections of in vivo synthesis of trehalose, glycogen or maltose were most interesting to investigate in recent years. Further, enzymes at different nodes (glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P and NDP-glucose) of metabolic pathways influence enhancement of trehalose accumulation. Most of the study of trehalose biosynthesis was explored in medically significant Mycobacterium, research model Escherichia coli, industrially applicable Corynebacterium and food and probiotic interest Propionibacterium freudenreichii. Therefore, the present review dealt with the trehalose metabolism in these bacteria. In addition, an effort was made to recognize how enzymes at different nodes of metabolic pathway can influence trehalose accumulation.
TI  - Acid-bile, antibiotic resistance and inhibitory properties of propionibacteria isolated from Turkish traditional home-made cheeses.
AB  - In this study, a total of 29 Propionibacterium spp. were isolated from traditional home-made Turkish cheese samples. As a result of the identification, isolates were identified as Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii (15 strains), Propionibacterium jensenii (12), and Propionibacterium thoenii (2). All isolates and 5 reference strains were examined for their abilities to survive at pH 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and in the presence of 0.06, 0.15 and 0.30% bile salts, their influence on the growth of food-borne and spoilage bacteria, as well as their sensitivity against 11 selected antibiotics. Only seven propionibacteria strains survived in both the acidic and bile salt environments. Propionibacterium spp. strains strongly inhibited growth of the Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and Shigella sonnei Mu:57 strains (91%). All propionibacteria strains were sensitive to a majority of the antibiotics used in the investigations. Overall, dairy propionibacteria showed high antibacterial activity, resistance to pH 4.0, 5.0, high resistance to bile salts and will provide an alternative source to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium as probiotic culture.
TI  - Safety evaluation of Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3 culture.
AB  - Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3 culture, a cell-free product of whey fermentation using P. freudenreichii ET-3 (7025), has been shown to promote the growth of Bifidobacteria through the action of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), and therefore, has potential use in the food and supplement industries. Although currently used as a food ingredient in Japan, the safety of this novel ingredient has not been previously evaluated through traditional toxicity testing. Therefore, here we report the results of standard toxicological testing performed on P. freudenreichii ET-3 culture. In a 4-week oral toxicity study, administration of 6000mg/kg body weight/day P. freudenreichii ET-3 culture was without compound-related adverse effects on clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, and gross and microscopic findings in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, in vitro mutagenicity testing demonstrated that P. freudenreichii ET-3 culture was non-mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay using a standard battery of bacterial strains (Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA) and non-clastogenic in Chinese hamster lung cells in the mammalian chromosome aberration test. Together, the results of these studies support the safety of P. freudenreichii ET-3 culture for use in foods for human consumption.
TI  - Control of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in corn silage with or without various inoculants: efficacy and mode of action.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 commercial bacterial inoculants at controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7 in corn silages during ensiling and feedout phases of silage production. A second objective was to determine whether the inoculants exhibited and transferred antibacterial activity against E. coli O157:H7 to the silages. Chopped corn forage was ensiled after treatment with the following: distilled water (control); 5 x 10(5) cfu/g of E. coli O157:H7 (EC); EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (EC+BII); EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri (EC+LB); and EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of L. buchneri and P. pentosaceus (EC+B500). Each treatment was ensiled in triplicate in mini silos for 3, 7, 31, and 82 d and analyzed for pH and E. coli O157:H7 counts. Samples from d 82 were also analyzed for volatile fatty acids, lactate, and aerobic stability. Antibacterial activity of inoculants and silages was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test. The pH of silages from all treatments decreased below 4 within 3 d of ensiling and remained low until d 82. Therefore, E. coli O157:H7 was not detected in silages after any of the ensiling durations. Applying inoculants containing L. buchneri resulted in less lactate, more acetate, and greater aerobic stability compared with the control. Applying EC+BII containing P. freudenreichii did not increase propionate or aerobic stability. Subsamples of d 82 silages were reinoculated with 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of E. coli O157:H7 either immediately after silo opening on d 82 or after 144h of aerobic exposure (d 88), and E. coli were enumerated 24h later. All silages reinoculated with the pathogen on d 82 had similar, low pH values (<4) and no E. coli were detected 24h later. Control, EC, and EC+BII silages reinoculated with the pathogen after 144h of aerobic exposure had relatively greater pH values (4.71, 5.67, and 6.03, respectively) and E. coli counts (2.87, 6.73, and 6.87 log cfu/g, respectively) 24h later, whereas those treated with L. buchneri had low pH values (<4) and undetectable (EC+B500) or 10-fold lower (1.97, cfu/g; EC+LB) E. coli counts. All pure cultures of commercial bacterial inoculants exhibited antibacterial activity independent of pH against E. coli O157:H7, but the pH-independent activity did not persist in the treated silages, suggesting that E. coli elimination from silages was mediated by pH reduction.
TI  - A genomic search approach to identify esterases in Propionibacterium freudenreichii involved in the formation of flavour in Emmental cheese.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipolysis is an important process of cheese ripening that contributes to the formation of flavour. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is the main agent of lipolysis in Emmental cheese; however, the enzymes involved produced by this species have not yet been identified. Lipolysis is performed by esterases (carboxylic ester hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.-) which are able to hydrolyse acylglycerols bearing short, medium and long chain fatty acids. The genome sequence of P. freudenreichii type strain CIP103027T was recently obtained in our laboratory.The aim of this study was to identify as exhaustively as possible the potential esterases in P. freudenreichii that could be involved in the hydrolysis of acylglycerols in Emmental cheese. The proteins identified were produced in a soluble and active form by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli for further study of their activity and specificity of hydrolysed substrates. RESULTS: The approach chosen was a genomic search approach that combined and compared four methods based on automatic and manual searches of homology and motifs among P. freudenreichii CIP103027T predicted proteins. Twenty-three putative esterases were identified in this step. Then a selection step permitted to focus the study on the 12 most probable esterases, according to the presence of the GXSXG motif of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. The 12 corresponding coding sequences were cloned in expression vectors, containing soluble N-terminal fusion proteins. The best conditions to express each protein in a soluble form were found thanks to an expression screening, using an incomplete factorial experimental design. Eleven out of the 12 proteins were expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and six showed esterase activity on 1-naphthyl acetate and/or propionate, as demonstrated by a zymographic method. CONCLUSION: We were able to demonstrate that our genomic search approach was efficient to identify esterases from the genome of a P. freudenreichii strain, more exhaustively than classical approaches. This study highlights the interest in using the automatic search of motifs, with the manual search of homology to previously characterised enzymes as a complementary method. Only further characterisations would permit the identification of the esterases of P. freudenreichii involved in the lipolysis in Emmental cheese.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle using various doses of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of direct-fed microbials at reducing Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in beef cattle was evaluated. Steers (n=240) received one of the following four treatment concentrations: control = lactose carrier only; low = 1 X 10(7) CFU per steer daily Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51; medium = 5 x 10(8) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51; and high = 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51. Low, medium, and high diets also included 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24. Feces were collected from each animal at allocation of treatment and found to have no variation (P = 0.54) between cohorts concerning E. coli O157 recovery. Feces and hide swabs were collected at harvest and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 by immunomagnetic separation and Salmonella by PCR. No significant dosing effects were detected for E. coli O157 recovery from feces at the medium dose or from hides at the medium and high doses. E. coli O157 was 74% (P < 0.01) and 69% (P < 0.01) less likely to be recovered in feces from animals receiving the high and low diets, respectively, compared with controls. Compared with controls, E. coli O157 was 74% (P = 0.05) less likely to be isolated on hides of cattle receiving the low dose. No significant dosing effects were detected for Salmonella recovery from feces at the medium and low doses or from hides at any doses. Compared with controls, Salmonella was 48% (P = 0.09) less likely to be shed in feces of cattle receiving the high dose. No obvious dose-response of L. acidophilus NP51 on recovery of E. coli O157 or Salmonella was detected in our study.
TI  - Pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of E. coli O157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.
AB  - Our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.
TI  - A genetic insight into peptide and amino-acid utilization by Propionibacterium freudenreichii LMG 16415.
AB  - In this note the genetic characterization of the peptide degrading system of Propionibacterium freudenreichii was addressed. Genomic fragments of P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii LMG 16415 were cloned in Escherichia coli XL1 Blue, and those leading to an increase in peptidase-like activity using chromogenic substrates aminoacyl-beta-naphtylamides (aminoacyl-betaNA) were isolated and sequenced. This strategy allowed the identification of partial gene regions of P. freudenreichii LMG 16415 with significant similarity to proteins directly or indirectly involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism, i.e., an oligopeptide transporter, a D-amino acid oxidase, a muropeptidase, and an ABC transporter involved in osmoregulation similar to glycine betaine transporters.
TI  - Microbial metabolomics with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
AB  - An analytical method was set up suitable for the analysis of microbial metabolomes, consisting of an oximation and silylation derivatization reaction and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Microbial matrixes contain many compounds that potentially interfere with either the derivatization procedure or analysis, such as high concentrations of salts, complex media or buffer components, or extremely high substrate and product concentrations. The developed method was extensively validated using different microorganisms, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and Escherichia coli. Many metabolite classes could be analyzed with the method: alcohols, aldehydes, amino acids, amines, fatty acids, (phospho-) organic acids, sugars, sugar acids, (acyl-) sugar amines, sugar phosphate, purines, pyrimidines, and aromatic compounds. The derivatization reaction proved to be efficient (>50% transferred to derivatized form) and repeatable (relative standard deviations <10%). Linearity for most metabolites was satisfactory with regression coefficients better than 0.996. Quantification limits were 40-500 pg on-column or 0.1-0.7 mmol/g of microbial cells (dry weight). Generally, intrabatch precision (repeatability) and interbatch precision (reproducibility) for the analysis of metabolites in cell extracts was better than 10 and 15%, respectively. Notwithstanding the nontargeted character of the method and complex microbial matrix, analytical performance for most metabolites fit the requirements for target analysis in bioanalysis. The suitability of the method was demonstrated by analysis of E. coli samples harvested at different growth phases.
TI  - Heterologous production of antimicrobial peptides in Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - Heterologous bacteriocin production in Propionibacterium freudenreichii is described. We developed an efficient system for DNA shuttling between Escherichia coli and P. freudenreichii using vector pAMT1. It is based on the P. freudenreichii rolling-circle replicating plasmid pLME108 and carries the cml(A)/cmx(A) chloramphenicol resistance marker. Introduction of the propionicin T1 structural gene (pctA) into pAMT1 under the control of the constitutive promoter (P4) yielded bacteriocin in amounts equal to those of the wild-type producer Propionibacterium thoenii 419. The P. freudenreichii clone showed propionicin T1 activity in coculture, killing 90% of sensitive bacteria within 48 h. The pamA gene from P. thoenii 419 encoding the protease-activated antimicrobial peptide (PAMP) was cloned and expressed in P. freudenreichii, resulting in secretion of the pro-PAMP protein. Like in the wild type, PAMP activation was dependent on externally added protease. Secretion of the antimicrobial peptide was obtained from a clone in which the pamA signal peptide and PAMP were fused in frame. The promoter region of pamA was identified by fusion of putative promoter fragments to the coding sequence of the pctA gene. The P4 and Ppamp promoters directed constitutive gene expression, and activity of both promoters was enhanced by elements upstream of the promoter core region.
TI  - Molecular analysis of promoter elements from Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a commercially important microorganism that is used in the production of cheeses, cobalamin (vitamin B(12)), and propionic acid. Although a host-vector system in propionibacteria has been developed, there is little information available on the genetic background of the bacteria. To obtain genetic information to facilitate genetic engineering in propionibacteria, we cloned promoter regions from P. freudenreichii using Escherichia coli as a host at the first screening and a promoter-probe vector, pCVE1, which consists of the cholesterol oxidase (choA) gene from Streptomyces sp. as a reporter gene. Finally, nine clones with strong promoter activities in P. freudenreichii were screened by monitoring the choA gene expression and determining if the nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragment were aligned. The initiation sites of these transcripts were determined by primer extension analysis. The putative consensus sequences corresponding to a -35 and -10 hexamer were found to be specific for P. freudenreichii, but not E. coli or other bacteria. Moreover, a new consensus heptamerous sequence between the -35 and -10 regions, termed the -16 region, was also found. It is possible that the putative consensus heptamer is functional and essential to promoter activity in P. freudenreichii. These results should provide new opportunities for controlled gene expression in P. freudenreichii.
TI  - Genetic manipulation system in propionibacteria.
AB  - Members of the genus Propionibacterium are widely used in the production of vitamin B12, tetrapyrrole compounds, and propionic acid as well as in probiotic and cheese industries. Shuttle vectors were developed in propionibacteria using replicons from endogenous plasmids in Propionibacterium and Escherichia coli and an appropriate selection marker. The efficient transformation was achieved using the shuttle vector prepared from Propionibacterium freudenreichii to overcome the high restriction modification system in propionibacteria. Expression vectors with native promoters for use in propionibacteria were also developed. Using this system, cholesterol oxidase, which is used as a diagnostic enzyme, was produced in P. freudenreichii. Genes involved in 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and vitamin B12 biosynthesis in propionibacteria were isolated. ALA in propionibacteria could be synthesized via both the C4 pathway (condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA) and the C5 pathway (from glutamate). The hemA gene encoding ALA synthase from Rhodobacter spheroides, was overexpressed and ALA accumulated in P. freudenreichii. Thus, the genetic manipulation systems in propionibacteria will facilitate genetic studies of probiotics and the vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathway.
TI  - Heterologous expression of a gene encoding cholesterol oxidase in probiotic strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii under the control of native promoters.
AB  - To develop systems for the expression of heterologous genes in probiotic strains  of Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium, we used Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and a modified gene encoding cholesterol oxidase (choA) from Streptomyces sp. to generate working models. The acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (acc) promoter derived from the acc operon of L. plantarum L137 and a previously constructed shuttle vector, pRN14, were used to construct vectors for the expression of heterologous genes in lactic acid bacteria. The concentration of cholesterol oxidase in recombinant L. plantarum carrying choA fused to the NH2-terminal region of the first open reading frame of the acc operon was 3.6 mU/mg of protein. Using the promoters from Propionibacterium, namely, P4, P8, and P138, which enabled high-level expression of choA in Escherichia coli, and a previously constructed shuttle vector pPK705, we constructed expression vectors for Propionibacterium. In recombinant P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii IFO12426, the activities of cholesterol oxidase generated under the control of promoters P4, P8, and P138 were 1.6, 4.3, and 7.2 U/mg of protein, respectively. The expression of heterologous genes may facilitate the production of useful proteins in these economically important bacteria.
TI  - Genetically engineered production of 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid, 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, and cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide in Escherichia coli implies a role for CbiD in C-1 methylation in the anaerobic pathway to cobalamin.
AB  - Co-expression of the cobA gene from Propionibacterium freudenreichii and the cbiA, -C, -D, -E, -T, -F, -G, -H, -J, -K, -L, and -P genes from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. A cbiD deletion mutant of this strain produced 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, indicating that CbiD is involved in C-1 methylation in the anaerobic pathway to cobalamin. Strains that did not have the cbiP gene also produced 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, and strains that had neither cbiP nor cbiA synthesized 1-desmethylcobyrinic acid even in the presence of cbiD, suggesting that CbiA and CbiP are necessary for CbiD activity.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 in finishing beef cattle by various doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus in direct-fed microbials.
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effects of three doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 and a combination treatment of strains NP51 and NP45 on prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in cattle. Three hundred steers were assigned randomly to 60 pens (five steers per pen) and received one of five treatments: (i) control, no added direct-fed microbial; (ii) HNP51, high dose of NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily; (iii) MNP51, NP51 at 10(8) CFU per steer daily; (iv) LNP51, low dose of NP51 at 10(7) CFU per steer daily; and (v) NP51+45, NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily and NP45 at 106 CFU per steer daily. All direct-fed microbial treatments included Propionibacterium freudenreichii at 10(9) CFU per steer. Individual rectal fecal samples were collected on arrival and every 28 days throughout the feeding period. Fecal and hide samples were collected on the day of harvest. Samples were analyzed for presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods. Cattle receiving HNP51, MNP51, and LNP51 had a lower prevalence (P < 0.01) of E. coli O157 throughout the feeding period compared with the controls, and the dose response for NP51 was a linear decrease in prevalence with increasing dose (P < 0.01). No decrease in prevalence for cattle receiving the combination NP51+45 was detected compared with controls (P = 0.15). E. coli O157 prevalences averaged across collection times were 23.9, 10.5, 9.9, 6.8, and 17.3% for cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51 +45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of fecal prevalence at harvest of E. coli O157 were 31.7, 12.5, 17.4, 8.2, and 41.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of the percentage of positive hide samples at harvest were 8.7, 5.9, 4.8, 3.4, and 8.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. The greatest decrease in E. coli O157 carriage was achieved using NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer.
TI  - Dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus- and Propionibacterium-based direct-fed microbials and prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in beef feedlot cattle and on hides at harvest.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in the feces and on the hides of finishing beef cattle fed a standard diet and those fed diets supplemented with direct-fed microbials. Two hundred forty steers received one of four treatments throughout the feeding period: (i) control: no added microbials; (ii) HNP51: high dose of Lactohacillius acidophilus strain NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily); (iii) HNP51+45: high dose of NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and L. acidophilus NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily); or (iv) LNP51+45: low dose of NP 51 (10(6) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily). Samples were collected from each animal and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods on day 0 (feces), 7 days before harvest (feces), and at harvest (feces and hide). At the end of the feeding period, cattle receiving HNP51 were 57% less likely to shed detectable E. coli O157 in their feces than were the controls (P < 0.01). For animals receiving HNP51+45 and LNP51+45, fecal prevalence did not differ from that of the controls. The prevalence of positive hide samples was least among cattle receiving HNP51+45 (3.3%); these animals were 79% less likely (P < 0.06) to have a positive hide sample than were the controls (prevalence = 13.8%). There was poor agreement of the culture results between fecal and hide samples collected from the same animal (kappa = 0.08; confidence interval = -0.05 to 0.2). Cattle supplemented with a high dose of NP 51 had reduced E. coli O157 prevalence in both fecal and hide samples, indicating that this treatment may be an efficacious preharvest intervention strategy.
TI  - Anti-stress activity of Propionibacterium freudenreichii : identification of a reactivative protein.
AB  - Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii is known to prevent mutations caused by various agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 9-aminoacridine, 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide and by UV radiation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It was also shown to prevent or repair damage caused by H(2)O(2) or UV radiation in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, a characteristic previously designated as reactivative effect. In order to characterise this effect at the molecular level, we have purified the active component from a P. freudenreichii cell-free extract using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The isolated 35 kDa protein was then identified using both N-terminal and internal peptide sequencing as a cysteine synthase. The latter was localised in the P. freudenreichii proteomic map. It is constitutively expressed but also clearly induced during adaptation to detergent and heat, but not acid, stresses. The biological meaning of cysteine synthase in the context of adaptation to oxidative and non-oxidative stresses is discussed.
TI  - Effects of live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (strains NP45 and NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics, and Escherichia coli strain O157 shedding of finishing beef steers.
AB  - In Exp. 1, 240 beef steers (initial BW = 332.8 kg) were used to determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) plus Propionibacterium freudenreichii (PF) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics; serum IgA concentrations; and the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 (EC). Cattle were fed a steam-flaked corn-based, 92% concentrate diet, and the four direct-fed microbial (DFM) treatments (12 pens/treatment) included in a randomized complete block design were as follows: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H); 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA51); and 4) 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L). No differences (P > 0.10) were detected for pen-based performance data. The average lamina propria thickness for LA51 and LA45-51H steers was less (P = 0.02) than the average for CON and LA45-51L steers. Moreover, LA51 and LA45-51H steers had a lower (P = 0.06) prevalence of EC shedding than CON and LA45-51L steers. In Exp. 2, 660 steers fed 91% concentrate, steam-flaked corn-based diets were used to determine the effects of the following DFM treatments (10 pens/treatment) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L); and 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H). Steers were from two weight groups (WG). One group (SDOF; BW at arrival = 351.5 kg) had grazed before arrival, and the other group (LDOF; BW at arrival = 314 kg) had been in a grower yard. A split plot was used with WG as the whole-plot factor and DFM in the split plot. There was an interaction of WG and DFM for ADG (P = 0.05) and for carcass-adjusted ADG (P = 0.08). The simple-effect ADG and carcass-adjusted ADG means for DFM treatments differed (P < or = 0.01) between WG classifications. Within SDOF, ADG for CON and LA45-51L did not differ (P = 0.70), but both were less (P < or = 0.08) than for LA45-51H. Overall, these data indicate that live cultures of LA plus PF did not greatly affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. Some of the DFM used decreased fecal EC shedding, which might be related to the results for ileal lamina propria thickness.
TI  - Construction of an expression vector for propionibacteria and its use in production of 5-aminolevulinic acid by Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - Several promoters from Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii were isolated using a promoter probe vector, pCVE1, containing the Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) as a reporter gene. Three of four promoters isolated exhibiting a strong activity in Escherichia coli also expressed a strong activity in P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii IFO12426. Using two promoters with a strong activity and a previously constructed shuttle vector, pPK705, shuttling between E. coli and Propionibacterium. we constructed expression vectors for propionibacteria. To overproduce 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is the first intermediate in the synthesis of porphyrins, the ALA synthase gene (hemA) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was recombined with the expression vectors. The activity of ALA synthase in the recombinant P freudenreichii subsp. shermanii increased about 70-fold that in the strain without a vector. The recombinant Propionibacterium produced ALA at a maximum concentration of 8.6 mM in the absence of levulinic acid, an inhibitor of ALA dehydratase, with 1% glucose as a carbon source. The recombinant P. freudenreichii accumulated 18.8 mmol/g cells ALA in the presence of 1 mM levulinic acid and 30 mM glycine. The construction of an efficient expression vector will facilitate genetic studies of a vitamin B12 producer, Propionibacterium.
TI  - Efficient transformation system for Propionibacterium freudenreichii based on a novel vector.
AB  - A 3.6-kb endogenous plasmid was isolated from a Propionibacterium freudenreichii  strain and sequenced completely. Based on homologies with plasmids from other bacteria, notably a plasmid from Mycobacterium, a region harboring putative replicative functions was defined. Outside this region two restriction enzyme recognition sites were used for insertion of an Escherichia coli-specific replicon and an erythromycin resistance gene for selection in Propionibacterium. Hybrid vectors obtained in this way replicated in both E. coli and P. freudenreichii. Whereas electroporation of P. freudenreichii with vector DNA isolated from an E. coli transformant yielded 10 to 30 colonies per microg of DNA, use of vector DNA reisolated from a Propionibacterium transformant dramatically increased the efficiency of transformation (> or =10(8) colonies per microg of DNA). It could be shown that restriction-modification was responsible for this effect. The high efficiency of the system described here permitted successful transformation of Propionibacterium with DNA ligation mixtures.
TI  - Characterization of pRGO1, a plasmid from Propionibacterium acidipropionici, and  its use for development of a host-vector system in propionibacteria.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of pRGO1, a cryptic plasmid from Propionibacterium acidipropionici E214, was determined. pRGO1 is 6, 868 bp long, and its G+C content is 65.0%. Frame analysis of the sequence revealed six open reading frames, which were designated Orf1 to Orf6. The deduced amino acid sequences of Orf1 and Orf2 showed extensive similarities to an initiator of plasmid replication, the Rep protein, of various plasmids of gram-positive bacteria. The amino acid sequence of the putative translation product of orf3 exhibited a high degree of similarity to the amino acid sequences of DNA invertase in several bacteria. For the putative translation products of orf4, orf5, and orf6, on the other hand, no homologous sequences were found. The function of these open reading frames was studied by deletion analysis. A shuttle vector, pPK705, was constructed for shuttling between Escherichia coli and a Propionibacterium strain containing orf1 (repA), orf2 (repB), orf5, and orf6 from pRGO1, pUC18, and the hygromycin B-resistant gene as a drug marker. Shuttle vector pPK705 successfully transformed Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii IFO12426 by electroporation at an efficiency of 8 x 10(6) CFU/microg of DNA under optimized conditions. Transformation of various species of propionibacteria with pPK705 was also performed at efficiencies of about 10(4) to 10(7) CFU/microg of DNA. The vector was stably maintained in strains of P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii, P. freudenreichii, P. pentosaceum, and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii grown under nonselective conditions. Successful manipulation of a host-vector system in propionibacteria should facilitate genetic studies and lead to creation of genes that are useful industrially.
TI  - cobA, a red fluorescent transcriptional reporter for Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammalian cells.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of Propionibacterium freudenreichii uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (cobA) as a reporter of gene expression in Escherichia coli, fission yeast, and mammalian cells. Overexpression of cobA in cells resulted in bright red fluorescence that was visualized with standard fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis at the single-cell level. As with green fluorescent protein (GFP), no addition of exogenous substrate was required. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells from a bicistronic transcript, cobA and GFP gave rise to fluorescence signals of similar intensity. The bright red fluorescence generated by the cobA reporter promises a better signal-to-noise ratio than blue and green fluorescent reporter systems, as autofluorescence and light scattering of cells, media, and materials are reduced in the red wavelengths.
TI  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins as a model for small intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of probiotics.
AB  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins were used as a model for small intestinal mucus to  investigate the adhesion of 12 Lactobacillus strains, one Lactococcus strain and one Propionibacterium strain, Both probiotic and dairy strains were tested. Adhesive and non-adhesive Escherichia coli strains were used as controls. All the strains were also tested for their adhesion to polystyrene. Adhesion to ileostomy glycoproteins and to polystyrene varied significantly among the strains tested. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (human isolate), Lactobacillus GG, Lact. acidophilus 1 and P. freudenreichii adhered to ileostomy glycoproteins. Adhesion was concentration-dependent and the most adhesive strains were able to saturate the substratum. These results indicate that human ileostomy glycoproteins can be used as a model system to select potential probiotic strains to complement the adhesion test with intestinal cell lines.
TI  - [Isolation and purification of a protective protein from Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. Shermanii].
AB  - A protein responsible for the protective and reactivating activities of two active fractions (AF1 and AF2) of the cells of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii was isolated. The active fraction AF1 was obtained by fractional precipitation of the cell-free extract of propionic acid bacteria between 20 and 40% ammonium sulfate saturation, whereas fraction AF2 was precipitated between 60 and 80% saturation. Further fractionation of AF1 and AF2 by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose yielded seven active subfractions, as revealed by testing for their protective activity on UV-inactivated cells of Escherichia coli. Analysis of subfraction AF2-2.5 by SDS-electrophoresis and HPLC showed that it contained an apparently homogeneous protein with a molecular mass of 44 +/- 2 kDa. The concentrational dependence of the protective activity of this protein was derived. Peptides of subfractions AF2-2.1 and AF2-2.2 with molecular masses lower than 15 kDa also exhibited protective activity.
TI  - The Propionibacterium freudenreichii hemYHBXRL gene cluster, which encodes enzymes and a regulator involved in the biosynthetic pathway from glutamate to protoheme.
AB  - A clone that can complement both Escherichia coli hemB and hemL mutations was found among plasmids containing the Propionibacterium freudenreichii hemB gene, which encodes delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. The regions upstream and downstream of the hemB gene were sequenced. Two open-reading frames (ORF1 and -2), which were similar to the hemY gene encoding protoporphyrinogen oxidase and the hemH gene encoding ferrochelatase from Bacillus subtilis, were found upstream of the hemB gene. ORF1 and -2 complemented the E. coli hemG mutation, defective in protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and the hemH gene respectively. Since ORF1 had no homology to hemG, the gene was designated hemY. The hemYHB genes appeared to be within the same transcription unit. Downstream from the hemB gene, three open-reading frames were found. One of these, transcribed in the same direction as the hemB gene, was identical to be the hemL gene, which encodes glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. The other two open-reading frames, located between the hemYHB and hemL genes, were transcribed divergently, and their deduced amino acid sequences showed similarities to a membrane-bound transport protein and a transcriptional regulatory protein respectively. The two genes may thus be involved in hem transport and the regulation of hem gene expression respectively, and were tentatively named hemX and hemR. Although hemX and hemL are unlikely to be part of the same operon, hemYHBXRL are clustered on the P. freudenreichii chromosome.
TI  - Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase of Entamoeba histolytica: molecular cloning, recombinant expression and inhibition by pyrophosphate analogues.
AB  - By using oligonucleotide primers derived from regions highly conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic phosphofructokinase sequences, a genomic DNA fragment was amplified and used to isolate cDNA and genomic clones coding for PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) of Entamoeba histolytica. The open reading frame consists of 1308 bp and the corresponding protein has a calculated molecular mass of 47.6 kDa. The N-terminal half of the protein shows 27-35% identity with PPi-PFKs or ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases (ATP-PFKs) of various eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The amino acid residues that form the active site of the PPi-PFK from Propionibacterium freudenreichii and the allosteric ATP-PFK from Escherichia coli are conserved within the amoeba sequence. The PPi-PFK was recombinantly expressed by using a prokaryotic expression system. The purified recombinant protein was found to be enzymically active. The K(m) values for PPi and fructose 6-phosphate of the native and the recombinant PPi-PFKs were nearly identical. Various bisphosphonates (synthetic pyrophosphate analogues) were tested for their ability to inhibit PPi-PFK activity or amoebic growth. All bisphosphonates tested were competitive inhibitors for amoeba PPi-PFK activity. The best inhibitors were CGP 48048 and zoledronate, with Ki values of 50 microM. All bisphosphonates inhibited amoebic growth. One of them (risedronate) was inhibitory at a concentration of 10 microM. Bisphosphonates are therefore potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of amoebiasis.
TI  - [Protective and reactive effect of a cellular extract from propionic acid bacteria on Candida guilliermondii and Escherichia coli, inactivated by ultraviolet radiation].
AB  - Dialyzed soluble proteins of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii cell extract (dialyzate) were found to exert a protective and reactivating effect on Candida guilliermondii and Escherichia coli cells inactivated by UV light of C and B ranges. Reactivation occurred when dialyzate was added to irradiated bacterial suspensions immediately after irradiation or 15 min afterwards. Some common features of dialyzate effect on irradiated prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells were established. No reactivation was observed when the cells were irradiated with the light of visible (400-600 nm) or entire optical (> 290 nm) ranges. The possible mechanisms of a reactivating effect of dialyzate are discussed.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase from Naegleria fowleri.
AB  - The cDNA for the PPi-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase has been cloned and sequenced from a cDNA library prepared from the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. The coding sequence of the cDNA consists of 1311 bases which translates into 437 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48095 Da. Comparison of the sequence with those of the previously described sequences of PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases from Propionibacterium freudenreichii and potato tuber revealed amino acid identities of 23 and 28% respectively and high conservation in those regions assumed to be part of the active site. The reading frame was cloned into an expression vector, which was transformed into Escherichia coli. Extracts of the transformed cells contained PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase activity that could be purified to homogeneity. The activity was lost on incubation with the chaotropic agent, KSCN, and recovered by subsequent incubation with AMP. These properties are consistent with those described by Mertens, De Jonckheere and Van Schaftingen [Biochem. J. (1993) 292, 797-803] for the enzyme prepared from Naegleria and support the idea that the cloned cDNA coded for the complete native enzyme. No nucleotide-binding motif or evidence for a nucleotide-binding site characteristic of the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases could be found within the primary structure.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase cobA gene of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (shermanii).
AB  - We cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed cobA, the gene encoding uroporphyrinogen  III methyltransferase in Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and examined the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The methyltransferase is similar in mass (27 kDa) and homologous to the one isolated from Pseudomonas denitrificans. In contrast to the much larger isoenzyme encoded by the cysG gene of Escherichia coli (52 kDa), the P. freudenreichii enzyme does not contain the additional 22-kDa peptide moiety at its N-terminal end bearing the oxidase-ferrochelatase activity responsible for the conversion of dihydrosirohydrochlorin (precorrin-2) to siroheme. Since it does not contain this moiety, it is not a likely candidate for synthesis of a cobalt-containing early intermediate that has been proposed for the vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathway in P. freudenreichii. Uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase of P. freudenreichii not only catalyzes the addition of two methyl groups to uroporphyrinogen III to afford the early vitamin B12 intermediate, precorrin-2, but also has an overmethylation property that catalyzes the synthesis of several tri- and tetra-methylated compounds that are not part of the vitamin B12 pathway. The enzyme catalyzes the addition of three methyl groups to uroporphyrinogen I to form trimethylpyrrocorphin, the intermediate necessary for biosynthesis of the natural products, factors S1 and S3, previously isolated from this organism. A second gene found upstream from the cobA gene encodes a protein homologous to CbiO of Salmonella typhimurium, a membrane-bound, ATP-dependent transport protein thought to be part of the cobalt transport system involved in vitamin B12 synthesis. These two genes do not appear to constitute part of an extensive cobalamin operon.
TI  - Identification of diary Propionibacterium species by rRNA gene restriction patterns.
AB  - A total of 78 strains of dairy propionibacteria, 4 reference strains of Propionibacterium and 8 related bacteria were characterized by ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene restriction patterns (ribotyping). The patterns were obtained after cleavage of total DNA with either BamHI or ClaI restriction endonucleases and hybridization of fragments with acetylaminofluorene-labelled 16 + 23S rRNA from Escherichia coli. The four different species of dairy propionibacteria, P. freudenreichii, P. jensenii, P. thoenii and P. acidipropionici, gave different restriction patterns with species-specific fragments. Moreover, ribotyping allowed the differentiation of P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii from P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. The patterns of dairy propionibacteria were different from those of closely related bacteria and other bacteria used in the dairy industry.
TI  - Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase complements fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase but not phosphofructokinase deficiency in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene from Propionibacterium freudenreichii for PPi-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase, an enzyme that is found in some bacteria, in a number of anaerobic protists, and in plants, complements the absence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase in Escherichia coli but does not complement the deficiency of the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase.
TI  - Identification of active site residues in pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The primary structure of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK) from Propionibacterium freudenreichii exhibits a low but significant level of sequence identity with Escherichia coli ATP-dependent PFK, permitting the tentative assignment of residues that may be involved in catalysis. Based on these assignments, the roles in catalysis of 2 aspartyl residues (Asp151 and Asp153) and 2 lysyl residues (Lys80 and Lys85) were examined. Mutagenesis of the Asp151 to alanine and serine reduced kcat by a factors of 2 x 10(4) and 4 x 10(5), respectively, while showing no change in Km for either substrate in the forward reaction or for metal ion in the back reaction. The kcat for Asp153 was decreased by a factor of 700 with no change in Km for pyrophosphate and an increase of about 20-fold in Km for fructose 6-P and close to 4-fold for magnesium ion. That these changes in the mutants were not the result of global conformational changes was indicated by their identical behavior during substrate-specific elution chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and limited proteolysis by trypsin and subtilisin. Mutations of Lys80 and Lys85 showed no significant changes in kinetic parameters, suggesting no involvement in mechanism or substrate binding. These and other results permit preliminary modeling of the active site of pyrophosphate-dependent PFK.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding glutamate 1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase, which is involved in delta-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - The gene from Propionibacterium freudenreichii that encodes glutamate 1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (EC 5.4.3.8), which is involved in the C5 pathway for synthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a precursor in heme and cobalamin biosynthesis, was cloned onto a multicopy plasmid, pUC18, via complementation of an ALA-deficient mutant (hemL) of Escherichia coli. Subcloning of fragments from the initial 3.3-kb chromosomal fragment allowed the isolation of a 1.9-kb fragment which could complement the hemL mutation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 1.9-kb DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) that was located downstream from a potential ribosome-binding site. The ORF encoded a polypeptide of 441 amino acid residues, and the deduced molecular mass of this polypeptide is 45,932 Da. A high G+C content (70 mol%) of the codons of the ORF was found and was consistent with the taxonomic features of Propionibacterium species. The amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology with those of the HemL proteins from other organisms, and a putative binding site for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was conserved, with the exception of a single substitution of phenylalanine for leucine. These results suggest that ALA is synthesized via the C5 pathway in a producer of vitamin B12, P. freudenreichii.
TI  - In vivo biotinylation of fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli with a sequence of Propionibacterium freudenreichii transcarboxylase 1.3S biotin subunit.
AB  - Biotinylation of fusion proteins in E. coli was studied using a sequence of Propionibacterium freudenreichii transcarboxylase 1.3S biotin subunit. As the biotinylation sequence, we examined two sequences: one was of amino acid residues [84-123] of 1.3S, a partial sequence containing a region from a conserved tetrapeptide (Ala-Met-Bct-Met) around the biotinyl lysine (Bct) to the carboxyl terminal; the other was of an almost entire sequence [18-123]. We constructed recombinant plasmids for fusion proteins of beta-galactosidase, of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and of alkaline phosphatase. We found the biotinylation in the [18-123] sequence fused to alkaline phosphatase.
TI  - Identification of critical lysyl residues in the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase of Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - Pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PPi-PFK) from Propionibacterium freudenreichii was inactivated by low concentrations of the lysine-specific reagent pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) after sodium borohydride reduction. The substrates fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate protected against inactivation whereas inorganic pyrophosphate had little effect. An HPLC profile of a tryptic digest of PPi-PFK modified at low concentrations of PLP showed a single major peak with only a small number of minor peaks. The major peak peptide was isolated and sequenced to obtain IGAGXTMVQK, where X represents a modified lysine residue, corresponding to Lys-315. Lys-315 was protected from reaction with PLP by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. As indicated by HPLC maps of PPi-PFK modified with varying concentrations of PLP, a direct correlation was observed between activity loss and the modification of Lys-315. Two of the minor peptide peaks were shown to contain Lys-80 and Lys-85, which were modified in a mutually exclusive manner. Partial protection against modification of these two residues was provided by MgPPi. The data were used to adjust the sequence alignment of the Propionibacterium enzyme with that of ATP-dependent PFK of Escherichia coli to identify homologous residues in the substrate binding site. It is suggested that Lys-315 interacts with the 6-phosphate of fructose 6-phosphate and that Lys-80 and -85 may be located near the pyrophosphate binding site.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase from Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - Pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PPi-PFK) from Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a non-allosteric enzyme with properties dissimilar to those of other described phosphofructokinases. The enzyme was cloned into pBluescript, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli at levels 15 times higher than those observed in Propionibacterium. The gene consists of 1215 bases which code for a protein of 404 amino acids and a mass of 43,243 daltons. High G + C in the codon usage (66%) of the gene is consistent with the classification of Propionibacterium in the High-G + C subdivision of the Gram-positive bacteria. While showing no sequence identity to the non-allosteric ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase of E. coli, alignments of the amino acid sequence with other PFKs reveal degrees of identities among the amino halves of the proteins, from 26% between the Propionibacterium and potato PPi-PFKs, and 29% between Propionibacterium and E. coli ATP-PFKs. These levels of identities indicate that the amino halves of these proteins are homologous. Identities between the carboxyl half of Propionibacterium PFK and carboxyl halves of other sequences are below 20%, suggesting that the carboxyl half is not homologous. Despite the poor conservation, most of the residues that take part in the binding of fructose-6-P or Mg-PPi could be readily identified by analogy to the structure of the E. coli PFK. Both the fructose-6-P and ATP-binding sites are conserved, indicating that PPi binds to the homologous site of the E. coli ATP-binding site.
TI  - Substances with biological activity of vitamin B12 formed during cultivation of Propionibacterium freudenreichii in the presence of precursors (short communications).
AB  - The papers of Kolhouse et al. and Cooper et al. described the occurrence of vitamin B12 analogues of unknown origin in blood serum. Some of these analogues may be derived from slaughter cattle raised on feed supplemented with vitamins and minerals, as was observed by Allen. Herbert et al. found vitamin B12 analogues in multivitamin preparations produced in U.S.A., and Kanazawa et al. in human liver, red cells and brain. It is not clear so far, if and how do vitamin B12 analogues interfere with vitamin B12 metabolism. When P. freudenreichii was cultivated in the presence of o-phenylenediamine and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, which may be considered precursors as well as antimetabolites of vitamin B12, the stimulation of biosynthesis of substances with biological activity of vitamin B12 took place. Various signs show that these substances are probably vitamin B12 analogues. During stimulated and nonstimulated production of vitamin B12 by P. freudenreichii, two substances with vitamin B12 biological activity have always been obtained. Their relation was not stable and differed according to the conditions of cultivation. Every attempt to stimulate the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 resulted in the suppression of production of the substance with higher molecular weight, even if the biosynthesis of cobalamin (lower molecular weight) was increased. In our note we want to pay attention to the character of substances arising in the stimulated biosynthesis.
TI  - Distribution of coenzyme B12-dependent diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase  in selected genera of Enterobacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae.
AB  - The presence of diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase was shown in several bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae grown anaerobically on 1,2-propanediol and on glycerol, respectively. Diol dehydratases of Enterobacteriaceae were immunologically similar, but distinct from that of Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
TI  - Sulfonamide resistance of propionibacteria: nutrition and transport.
AB  - Three variations of a synthetic growth medium were used to study the folic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) requirements of Propionibacterium. P. shermanii, P. freudenreichii, P. thoenii, and P. arabinosum synthesize folic acid and do not require PABA or folic acid. P. pentosaceum, P. jensenii, and P. rubrum are stimulated by folic acid or PABA, but do not show an absolute requirement. P. peterssonii shows a requirement for either PABA or folic acid. The addition of 300 mug of sulfadiazine per ml did not inhibit growth of propionibacteria in the synthetic medium, synthetic medium plus PABA, or synthetic medium plus folic acid. P. freudenreichii was not inhibited even when 500 mug of sulfadiazine per ml was added to the synthetic medium, nor did it degrade sulfadiazine significantly. Trimethoprim totally inhibited the growth of Propionibacterium. Radioactive sulfadiazine was transported by sulfadiazine-sensitive Escherichia coli but not by P. freudenreichii, indicating that the sulfadiazine resistance of propionibacteria could be mainly due to their inability to transport sulfonamides.
