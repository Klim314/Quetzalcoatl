TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == multicenter survey of the changing in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus species.
AB  == in vitro surveys of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important anaerobes are an important source of information that can be used for clinical decisions in the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy. this study surveyed the susceptibilities of 556 clinical anaerobic isolates from four large medical centers using a broth microdilution method. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only  antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were susceptible. similarly, imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole were highly active (resistance, <0.5%), whereas the lowest susceptibility rates were noted for penicillin g, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. for most antibiotics, blood isolates were less susceptible than isolates from intra-abdominal, obstetric-gynecologic, and other  sources. all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole, while resistance to imipenem and meropenem was low (<2%). for these same isolates, resistance rates (intermediate  and resistant mics) to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, trovafloxacin, and clindamycin were 11, 8, 7, and 29%, respectively. among the individual species of the b. fragilis group, the highest resistance rates were noted among the following organism-drug combinations: for clindamycin, bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides ovatus; for cefoxitin, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis; for ampicillin-sulbactam, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, and b. uniformis; and for trovafloxacin, bacteroides vulgatus. for the carbapenens, imipenem resistance was noted among b. fragilis and meropenem resistance was seen among b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, and b. uniformis. with few exceptions all antimicrobial agents were highly active against isolates of prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus. these data further establish and confirm that clinically important anaerobes can vary widely in their antimicrobial susceptibilities. fortunately most antimicrobial agents were active against the test isolates. however, concern is warranted for what appears to be a significant increases in resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam and clindamycin.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the production of heparinase by a wide range of anaerobic bacteria isolated from  clinical specimens was investigated. none of the 29 strains of bacteroides fragilis produced heparinase. of 62 other bacteroides tested, only two of four strains of b ovatus, two of three strains of b thetaiotaomicron, and two of four  strains of b uniformis were heparinase producers. none of the 48 strains of fusobacteria or seven strains of veillonella produced heparinase. the anaerobic cocci (19 peptococci and seven peptostreptococci) were also negative for heparinase production as were 46 clostridium spp tested. it was concluded that heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria was unlikely to play a part in the regional thrombophlebitis that sometimes occurs in anaerobic infections.

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == characterization of the cecal bacteria of normal pigs.
AB  == one hundred ninety-two isolates from cecal contents of three normal weaned pigs were obtained by means of anaerobic roll tube methods and were characterized. seventy-eight percent of the isolates were gram-negative. the most numerous species isolated from each of the pigs was bacteroides ruminicola. this species accounted for 35% of the isolates that were characterized, and selenomonas ruminantium accounted for 21% of the isolates. other gram-negative bacteria isolated from all three pigs were butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (6.0%) and bacteroides uniformis (3.0%); predominant gram-positive isolates were lactobacillus acidophilus (7.6%), peptostreptococcus productus (3.0%), and eubacterium aerofaciens (2.5%). the other 42 isolates were placed in 14 other species, and 5 additional isolates that did not fit well into existing species were not placed taxonomically. fifteen of the isolates (representing nine species) produced urease.

TI  == fecal bacteria in south african rural blacks and other population groups.
AB  == quantitative studies were performed on fecal flora of three population groups consuming different diets. twenty rural black south africans and 22 japanese, representing groups at low risk for carcinoma of the colon, were compared with 41 north americans from a high-risk population. specimens taken immediately after defecation were mixed and processed under anaerobic conditions. after the initial incubation, roll tubes were shipped to the united states for final identification. bacterioides and bifidobacteria were present in lower numbers in  south african subjects, as were bacteroides uniformis (thought to be increased by conditions of fear and anger stress), compared with the other two groups. the number of b. vulgatus and b. distasonis and the "peptostreptococcus productus species complex," showed a positive correlation with the risk of colon cancer, while an inverse relationship was found with eubacterium aerofaciens ii, b. fragilis and escherichia coli. the percentage of fecal isolates stimulated by bile was slightly higher in populations with a high fat intake and a high risk of cancer of the colon.

TI  == identification of bacteroides fragilis by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  == rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens  from five different species of the 'b. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the b. fragilis nctc 9343 polysaccharide. when the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 b. fragilis strains were correctly identified. only 8 of the other 312 bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-b fragilis serum. the 'cross-reactive' bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "b. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., b; distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and  b. vulgatus). none of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing salmonella, e. coli, proteus, yersinia, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and  pseudomonas were positive using the anti-b. fragilis serum. likewise, all the 59  gram-positive strains representing streptococcus, bacillus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and clostridium did not stain. our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that b. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
