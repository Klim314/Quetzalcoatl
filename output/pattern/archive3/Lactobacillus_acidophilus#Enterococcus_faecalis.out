antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000 to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l. acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.
antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is discussed.
purification and partial characterization of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088.
lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088 (nck88), was purified and characterized. lactacin f is heat stable, proteinaceous, and inhibitory to other lactobacilli as well as enterococcus faecalis. the bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellet from culture supernatants brought to 35 to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate. native lactacin f was sized at approximately 180 kda by gel filtration. column fractions having lactacin f activity were examined by electron microscopy and contained micelle-like globular particles. purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in a 474-fold increase in specific activity of lactacin f. the purified bacteriocin was identified as a 2.5-kda peptide by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the lactacin f peptide retained activity after extraction from sds-page gel slices, confirming the identity of the 2.5-kda peptide. variants of nck88 that failed to exhibit lactacin f activity did not produce the 2.5-kda band. sequence analysis of purified lactacin f identified 25 n-terminal amino acids containing an arginine residue at the n terminus. composition analysis indicates that lactacin f may contain as many as 56 amino acid residues.
influence of bacteria on clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
when monoflora chickens with lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of c. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. c. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g after inoculation 10(8) cfu broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. when c. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, c. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. these findings indicate that the pathogenicity of c. perfringens was suppressed by l. acidophilus or s. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.
nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.
