early lysis of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 303 in swiss cheese is not prophage-related.
lactobacillus helveticus is mainly used as starter in swiss-type cheeses. often,  lysogenic strains are eliminated because of the risk of early lysis and acidification failure due to phage expression. on the other hand, l. helveticus lysis was shown to positively influence cheese proteolysis during ripening. in order to better assess the relationship between lysis and lysogeny, a prophage-cured derivative of l. helveticus cnrz 303 was isolated (lh 303-g11) and relysogenised (lh 303-g11r), as demonstrated by hybridisation using the whole phage dna as probe. the growth, lysis in buffered solutions and lytic activities in zymogram using either micrococcus luteus or l. helveticus as substrate were identical between the mother strain and its cured derivatives. only morphological differences were observed by scanning electron microscopy: the cells of the cured derivative were shorter in length. the mother strain and its cured and relysogenised derivatives were assayed in triplicate in experimental swiss cheeses (scale 1:100). no differences were noted during the cheese making: the three strains exhibited identical kinetics of acidification, leading to similar cheeses at day 1 in terms of gross composition and ph. phages were detected only in the cheeses made with the mother strain and the relysogenised derivative. the lysis of l. helveticus, estimated by viability decrease and release of the intracellular marker d-lactate deshydrogenase, started early before brining and continued during the cold room ripening. no obvious differences of lysis extent were observed. these results demonstrated for the first time that, in the case of lh 303, the extensive lysis observed in cheese is mainly due to autolysin activity and not to prophage induction.
