TI  == tlr2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via rac1- and pi3k-mediated inside-out signaling in response to porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == we present evidence for a novel tlr2 function in transmodulating the adhesive activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of p. gingivalis fimbriae in stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. fimbriae induced cd11b/cd18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor icam-1; these activities were inhibited by tlr2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of pi3k. moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of clostridium difficile toxin b, but was not affected by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. accordingly, we subsequently showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small gtpases, that rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind icam-1. a dominant negative mutant of rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of pi3k suggesting that rac1 acts upstream of pi3k in this proadhesive pathway. furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to huvec and transmigration across huvec monolayers; both activities required tlr2 and rac1 signaling and were dependent upon icam-1 and the high-affinity state of cd11b/cd18. p. gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. thus, p.  gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, involving tlr2, rac1, pi3k, and cd11b/cd18, which may constitute a mechanistic basis linking p. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.

TI  == mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. resistance to quinolones is  increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase iv) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. these mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. high-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. the increasing emergence of resistance among  anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. quinolone resistance in the bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with  amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in gyra (equivalent to positions  83 and 87 of escherichia coli). several studies have indicated that b. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. dna gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in gyra and gyrb have been  detected in resistant strains. to what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.

TI  == fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-coa.
AB  == clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coa and crotonyl-coa to acetate and butyrate. the genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfd (4-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydratase),  abft (4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase), and abfh (nad-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). the genes abfd and abft were cloned, sequenced  and expressed as active enzymes in escherichia coli. hence the insertion of the [4fe-4s]clusters and fad into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from c. aminobutyricum. the amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the coa-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of clostridium difficile, porphyromonas gingivalis and archaeoglobus fulgidus. in addition the n-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those  of a family of fad-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. the putative assignment in the databank of cat2 (orfz) from clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with abft (57% identity). furthermore, an acetyl-coa:4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of c. kluyveri.  in contrast to glutaconate coa-transferase from acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive exg, which is conserved in many homologues of abft, does not form a coa-ester during catalysis.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == [in vitro activities of sulopenem, a new parenteral penem, against anaerobes].
AB  == in vitro activities of sulopenem, a novel parenteral penem, was compared with those of imipenem, flomoxef, cefuzonam, cefoperazone and sulbactam/ampicillin against 66 reference strains (19 genera, 61 species) and 392 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and fastidious aerobic bacteria. sulopenem had a very broad spectrum against anaerobic bacteria. in general, this compound was active against anaerobic reference strains with mics of < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml, while being the least active against bifidobacterium spp. and less active than imipenem against lactobacillus spp. sulopenem was more active against bacteroides fragilis isolates than imipenem and had the highest activities against bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. among the antibiotics  tested. sulopenem was not hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinase type 1 produced  by b. fragilis gai-0558, gai-7955 and gai-10150 and its stability was comparable  to imipenem. its susceptibilities to hydrolysis by a metallo-beta-lactamase from  b. fragilis gai-30144 was less than imipenem. sulopenem (120 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 days) was as effective as imipenem/cilastatin against a mixed intraabdominal mice infection due to e. coli and b. fragilis. sulopenem (20 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days) did not induce an overgrowth of clostridium difficile in  the caecum of mice.

TI  == virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == various surface structures can be expressed in bacteroides fragilis, but little is known about capsular structures in other non-spore-forming anaerobes. fimbriae have been isolated from bacteroides fragilis and porphyromonas gingivalis. the importance of iron-repressible outer membrane proteins as virulence factors in bacteroides fragilis is under study. the low endotoxic activity of bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide can be attributed to the chemical composition of this organism's lipid a. a tissue culture system for the demonstration of bacteroides  fragilis enterotoxin has recently been described. the toxins a and b of clostridium difficile are immunologically distinct. the importance of iga proteases and other enzymes as virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria remains unclear.
