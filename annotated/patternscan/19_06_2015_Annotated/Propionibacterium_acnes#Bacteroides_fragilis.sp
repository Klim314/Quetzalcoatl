TI  == maldi-tof ms fingerprinting facilitates rapid discrimination of phylotypes i, ii  and iii of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is widely used today for species determination of bacteria and fungi in routine microbiological laboratories, and can also be used for subtyping of bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis. propionibacterium acnes is frequently  referred to as an anaerobic skin commensal of relatively low pathogenicity. in addition to its accepted pathogenic role in acne, p. acnes is now emerging as an  important opportunistic pathogen in many other clinical situations, including late-stage prosthetic joint infections, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, post-neurosurgical infections and possibly prostate cancer. at the population genetic level, p. acnes can be differentiated into a number of distinct phylogroups, known as types ia1, ia2, ib, ic, ii and iii, which may be associated with different types of infections and clinical conditions. the aim of the present study was to evaluate ms-based typing for resolution of these genetic groups after routine identification by maldi-tof ms (bruker maldi biotyper). the  software package clinprotools 2.2 was used to analyze the protein based mass spectra of reference strains belonging to types ia, ib, ic, ii and iii. phylogroup-specific peaks and peak shifts were then identified visually. in addition, peak variations between the different types of p. acnes were investigated by using flexanalysis 3.3 software (bruker). a differentiating library was created, which was used to type further 48 clinical isolates of p. acnes. typing data obtained by maldi-tof ms were then compared with the results from multilocus sequence typing (mlst). most of the clinical isolates (n = 19) belonged to the type ia grouping according to maldi-tof ms. by mlst, all isolates were identified as type ia1. twenty-one clinical isolates belonged to the type ib cluster based on both maldi-tof ms and mlst typing. eight clinical isolates were  identified as type ii strains by both typing methods and all the type iii reference strains could be distinguished by the presence of a unique type iii-specific peak (7238 da) by the maldi-tof ms. our study demonstrates that maldi-tof ms is a reliable and powerful tool for rapid identification and typing  of p. acnes strains from the main genetic divisions of the species.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == characteristics and outcome of 16 periprosthetic shoulder joint infections.
AB  == purpose: shoulder arthroplasties are increasingly performed, but data on periprosthetic joint infections (pji) in this anatomical position are limited. we retrospectively investigated the characteristics and outcome of shoulder pji after primary arthroplasty from 1998 to 2010 in a single centre. methods: periprosthetic joint infection was defined as periprosthetic purulence, presence  of sinus tract or microbial growth. a kaplan-meier survival method was used to estimate relapse-free survival of prosthesis. results: from 1,571 primary shoulder prostheses, we evaluated 16 patients with a pji at different stages, i.e, early (n = 4), delayed (n = 6) and late (n = 6) infections. the median patient age was 67 (range 53-86) years, and 69 % were females. the most commonly  isolated microorganism was propionibacterium acnes in 38 % of patients (monobacterial in four and polymicrobial in two patients). in 14 of the 16 patients, surgical interventions consisting of debridement and implant retention  (6 patients), exchange (7) and explantation (1) were performed. four patients had a relapse of infection with p. acnes (n = 3) or bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). the relapse-free survival of the prosthesis was 75 % (95 % confidence interval 46-90  %) after 1 and 2 years, 100 % in six patients following the treatment algorithm for hip and knee pji and 60 % in 10 patients not followed up. all but one of the  relapses were previously treated without exchange of the prosthesis. conclusions: as recommended for hip and knee pji, we suggest treating shoulder pji with a low-grade infection by microorganisms such as p. acnes with an exchange of the prosthesis. cohort studies are needed to verify our results.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of metapex (calcium hydroxide with iodoform formulation) at different concentrations against selected microorganisms--an in vitro study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess, in vitro, the effectiveness of several concentrations of metapex (0.22 gm/ml, 0.022 gm/ml, 0.0022 gm/ml) in the elimination of selected microorganisms. different concentrations of metapex were  prepared by dissolving it in ethanol (99.9%) pre-sterilized whatman paper discs,  6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates. plates were incubated aerobically for enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and candida albicans (c. albicans), anaerobically for bacteroid fragilis (b. fragilis) and propionibacterium acne respectivally. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. there was significant reduction in the size of zone  of inhibition against p. acne, as the concentration of metapex decreases. at lower concentrations of metapex there was no zone of inhibition observed against  e. faecalis, c. albicans and b. fragilis. the result of this study suggested that metapex is a potent antimicrobial agent at higher concentration.

TI  == oropharyngeal flora changes after tonsillectomy.
AB  == objective: we aimed to investigate the effect of tonsillectomy on oropharyngeal flora in children who underwent tonsillectomy for chronic recurrent tonsillitis.  study design and setting: a prospective study was performed comprising patients with chronic recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy at the department  of otolaryngology, cerrahpasa medical school. incisional core biopsies of excised tonsils were also performed. swabs and core biopsy specimens were transferred and maintained in stuart's medium and sent to the department of microbiology and clinical microbiology at cerrahpasa medical school for microbiologic evaluation.  subjects and methods: oropharyngeal swabs and tonsillar core biopsy specimens from 31 patients operated on for recurrent tonsillitis were cultured. follow-up oropharyngeal swabs were cultured one month after tonsillectomy. results: there was no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative isolation rate of the potentially pathogenic bacteria. normal aerobic flora did not change significantly. however, the isolation rate of the neisseria species dropped (p = 0.097) but did not reach statistical significance. among anaerobes,  bacteroides fragilis, one of the major anaerobic bacteria, dropped significantly  (p = 0.007). the propionibacterium acnes isolation rate increased significantly (p = 0.009). conclusion: oropharyngeal anaerobic bacterial flora decreases after  tonsillectomy in recurrent tonsillitis patients. the isolation rate for bacteria  of the normal flora and potentially pathogenic bacteria does not change. tonsils  with recurrent infections may become a nidus for anaerobic bacteria. in patients  with chronic recurrent tonsillitis, tonsillectomy may help change anaerobic bacterial oropharyngeal flora to the normal flora found in healthy individuals.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this review summarizes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis (ie) due to anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of ie. most cases are caused by the anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci propionibacterium acnes, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species. predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of ie caused by  anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in ie due to facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions: there is a lower incidence of pre-existing valvular heart disease, a higher incidence of thromboembolic events  and a higher mortality rate with anaerobic ie. the gastrointestinal tract is the  most common source for b. fragilis group ie, the head and neck are the most common origin for fusobacterium and bacteroides species, and the head and neck or genitourinary tract is the most common source for peptostreptococcus species. multiple mycotic aneurysms are a common complication with anaerobic ie. others include valvular destruction, aortic-ring abscess, aortitis, cardiogenic shock, dysrrhythmias and septic shock. the mortality rate for patients with anaerobic ie ranges from 21 to 43%. treatment of anaerobic ie includes the use of antimicrobial effective against these organisms. surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients.

TI  == microbiology and management of joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria. results: the predominant anaerobes in arthritis are anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb) including the bacteroides fragilis group, fusobacterium spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes. infection with p. acnes is associated with a prosthetic  joint, previous surgery, and trauma. b. fragilis group is associated with distant infection, clostridium spp. with trauma, and fusobacterium spp. with oropharyngeal infection. most cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate, and most cases are secondary  to hematogenous spread. the predominant anaerobes in osteomyelitis are bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and clostridium spp. as well as p. acnes. conditions predisposing to bone infections are vascular disease, bites, contiguous infection, peripheral neuropathy, hematogenous spread, and trauma. pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. are mostly isolated in skull and bite infections, members of the b. fragilis group in hand and feet infections, and fusobacterium spp. in skull, bite, and hematogenous long bone infections. many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of an anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body that is the source of the organisms involved in the osteomyelitis. treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material, and antibiotic therapy effective against  these organisms. conclusions: anaerobic bacteria can cause septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy are important contributor to successful outcome.

TI  == in vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  == objectives: retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. methods: the in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. mics were determined by the clsi reference agar  dilution method (m11-a6). results: ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the bacteroides fragilis group. despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the b. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/l or less. all the investigated strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/l retapamulin. three strains of c. difficile and one strain of c. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/l. conclusions: at <or=2 mg/l, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. the  broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == bacteremia due to anaerobic bacteria in newborns.
AB  == awareness of the role of anaerobic bacteria in neonatal bacteremia has increased  in recent years. the incidence of recovery of anaerobes in neonatal bacteremia varies, according to different studies, between 1.8% and 12.5%. of the 178 cases  reported in the literature, 73 were due to bacteroides species (69 were the bacteroides fragilis group), 57 clostridium species (mostly clostridium perfringens), 35 peptostreptococci, 5 propionibacterium acnes, 3 veillonella species, 3 fusobacterium species, and 2 eubacterium species. predisposing factors were perinatal maternal complications (especially premature rupture of membranes  and chorioamnionitis), prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis. organisms similar to those recovered in blood were concomitantly isolated in lung aspirates and cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids. the overall mortality noted is 26% and is highest with b fragilis group (34%). inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was often a contributory factor for such mortality. correction of underlying pathology, surgical drainage, and the use of proper antimicrobials are critical to successful resolution of the infection. penicillin g is the drug of choice for anaerobic infection other than beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides. antimicrobials useful for therapy of beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides include clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem-cilastatin, and the combination of a penicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in aortofemoral graft infection.
AB  == a 10-year review of specimens of aortofemoral graft infection sent to the microbiology laboratory for cultures of anaerobic bacteria revealed the presence  of these organisms in 13 of 16 specimens. nineteen organisms (1.5 per patient) were isolated: 16 anaerobes and 3 aerobes. the predominant bacteria were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (six isolates), propionibacterium acnes (five), and bacteroides fragilis group (four). polymicrobial infection was present in three patients, all with decubitus ulcers. conditions predisposing to the infections were present in nine patients and included the presence of preoperative infections in the form of ulcer or toe gangrene in four, decubitus ulcer in three, reoperation in two, and diabetes mellitus in one. these data illustrate the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in aortofemoral graft infection.

TI  == [in vitro activity of an ofloxacin-metronidazole combination against anaerobic bacteria. kinetics of the action of metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis].
AB  == the activity of metronidazole combined with ofloxacin was investigated by the checkerboard method in liquid medium against 60 obligate anaerobes. the bacteriostatic effect of the combination was assessed by calculating the fic index. two metronidazole resistant strains of propionibacterium acnes (mic greater than 32 mg/l) were inhibited by 0.125 mg/l of this former antibiotic in presence of an ofloxacin concentration equal to half the value of the mic. on the 58 other anaerobic strains, the combination of metronidazole plus ofloxacin had an additive bacteriostatic effect (30 strains) or a synergistic effect (26 strains). no antagonism was noted with any strain. for selected anaerobic or mixed infections the combination of metronidazole and ofloxacin may be useful. killing curves demonstrated that, under good anaerobic conditions, metronidazole  acted rapidly against bacteroides fragilis. at a concentration of 8 mg/l, a decrease of log10 of the population was observed after 2 hours. after a contact ranging from 1 to 8 hours, depending of the investigated strains, a bactericidal  effect was observed with metronidazole.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. metronidazole was the most active  agent; only propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant.  clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. beta-lactam  antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the bacteroides fragilis group. at a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. the highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the b. fragilis group. within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. we conclude that metronidazole has the most  predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  == twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. peptococci (peptococcus asaccharolyticus,  p. magnus, p. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus micros, p. anaerobius, p. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces israelii, and bacteroides fragilis). antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or  osteosynthesis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. four hundred  seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. the cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. the conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. the predominant aerobes isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and haemophilus vaginalis. the predominant anaerobes were the bacteroides fragilis group, propionibacterium acnes, peptococcus, other bacteroides and peptostreptococcus organisms. statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.

TI  == low trimethoprim susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria due to insensitive dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  == all the 28 bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to  trimethoprim (tmp; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). synergism between sulfamethoxazole and tmp was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. the few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. dihydrofolate reductases from b. fragilis, c. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. for 50% inhibition, the enzyme from b. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of tmp which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. in vitro activities of tmp were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic  level in b. fragilis and p. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the  activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than tmp were found to be as active as tmp both at the enzyme and in vitro. in b. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of tmp than in e. coli and probably also in c. perfringens.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == detection of alcohols and volatile fatty acids by head-space gas chromatography in identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a head-space gas chromatographic technique for the analysis of volatile bacterial metabolites is described. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and propionibacterium acnes, cultured in a glucose-containing peptone yeast extract medium, were studied. the head-space technique was compared with the injection of the complete liquid culture medium, and solvent extracts thereof, into the gas chromatograph. volatile fatty acids could be detected by all three methods, whereas alcohols produced by c. perfringens and p. acnes were detectable only in  the head-space chromatograms. both ffap and porapak q were used as gas chromatography stationary phase. porapak q was found more suitable than ffap for  the separation of alcohols. the head-space technique requires a minimum of preparation before the analysis and is well suited to automation.

TI  == superoxide dismutase in anaerobic bacteria of clinical significance.
AB  == twenty-two anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected sites and normal fecal flora were assayed for superoxide dismutase (sod). the organisms were also classified according to their oxygen tolerance into aerotolerant, intermediate, and extremely oxygen-sensitive groups. there was a correlation between the enzyme level and the oxygen tolerance, in that the aerotolerant and intermediate organisms had sod, whereas the extremely oxygen-sensitive isolates had low or undetectable enzyme. among the oxygen-tolerant organisms, gram-negative bacteria  had higher levels of sod than gram-positive organisms. oxygen was shown to induce sod production in a strain of bacteriodes fragilis grown in minimal medium under  continuous-culture conditions. enzyme levels in this isolate grown under static conditions were lower in minimal medium than in complex medium, indicating that other components in the complex medium were stimulating the production of sod. our data suggest that the variation in oxygen tolerance of anaerobes is usually related to their level of sod. it is postulated that sod may be a virulence factor that allows pathogenic anaerobes to survive in oxygenated tissues until the proper reduced conditions are established for their growth.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.
