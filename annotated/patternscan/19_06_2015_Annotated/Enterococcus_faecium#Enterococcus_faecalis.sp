TI  == preterm infant gut colonization in the neonatal icu and complete restoration two  years later.
AB  == preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) are exposed to multi-drug resistant bacteria previously adapted to the hospital environment. the aim of the present study was to characterize the bacterial antibiotic-resistant high-risk lineages colonizing preterm infants during their nicu stay and their persistence in faeces after 2 years. a total of twenty-six preterm neonates were  recruited between october 2009 and june 2010 and provided 144 faecal samples. milk samples (86 mothers' milk, 35 human donor milk, and 15 formula milk) were collected at the same time as faecal samples. an additional faecal sample was recovered in 16 infants at the age of two years. samples were plated onto different selective media and one colony per morphology was selected. isolates were identified by 16s rdna nucleotide sequence and maldi-tof. antibiotic susceptibility (agar dilution), genetic diversity (rapd, pfge and mlst) and virulence factors (only in enterococcal and staphylococcal isolates) were determined by pcr. a high proportion of antibiotic resistant high-risk clones was detected in both faecal and milk samples during the nicu admittance. almost all infants were colonized by enterococcus faecalis st64 and enterococcus faecium st18 clones, while a wider genetic diversity was observed for the gram-negative isolates. multi-resistant high-risk clones were not recovered from the faecal samples of the 2-year-old infants. in conclusion, the gut of the preterm infants  admitted in nicu might be initially colonized by antibiotic-resistant and virulent high-risk lineages, which are later replaced by antibiotic-susceptible community ones.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw goat milk and effect of farming practices on the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactococcuslactis, play a decisive role in the cheese making process and more particularly in lactic cheeses which are primarily produced on goat dairy farms. the objective of this study was therefore to identify the main lactic acid bacteria found in raw goats' milk from three different regions in france and evaluate if certain farming practices have an effect on the distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria in the various milk samples. identification at genus or species level was carried out using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods including repetitive element rep-pcr, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the distribution of the main bacterial species in the milk samples varied depending on farms and their characteristics. out of the 146 strains identified, l. lactis was the dominant species (60% of strains), followed by enterococcus (38%) of which enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. within the species l. lactis, l. lactis subsp  lactis was detected more frequently than l. lactis subsp cremoris (74% vs. 26%).  the predominance of l. lactis subsp cremoris was linked to geographical area studied. it appears that the animals' environment plays a role in the balance between the dominance of l. lactis and enterococci in raw goats' milk. the separation between the milking parlor and the goat shed (vs no separation) and only straw in the bedding (vs straw and hay) seems to promote l. lactis in the milk (vs enterococci).

TI  == non-linear significant relationship between use of glycopeptides and isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus species in a university hospital setting.
AB  == background: emergence of colonization and infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) has become a worldwide challenge. to investigate whether the increasing incidence of vre isolation can be correlated with use of glycopeptides in the hospital setting, we conducted a hospital-wide two-year study in the university hospital of vienna. methods: within the period from january 2011 through december 2012 all patients with isolation of invasive or non-invasive vre were retrospectively included. specialty-specific data concerning the consumption of vancomycin and teicoplanin, fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins in defined daily doses (ddds) from june 2010 through may 2012 were extracted from the hospital pharmacy computer system. to assess the relationship  between the usage of those antibiotics and the incidence of vre (vre-rate per 10  000 patients) a poisson regression was performed. findings: in the study period 266 patients were colonized or infected with vre. specialty-specific vre isolation was as follows: general surgical units (44 patients), bone marrow transplant unit (35 patients), general medical units (33 patients), cardiothoracic surgery (27 patients), nephrology (26 patients), haematooncology (22 patients), gastroenterology (17 patients), urology (17 patients), and the infectious diseases unit (11 patients). hospital-wide consumption of glycopeptides was higher for teicoplanin than for vancomycin (26 242 versus 8677  ddds). specialty-specific vre incidence significantly increased with the use of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins (p < 0.001). the results of the poisson regression for vancomycin (p = 0.0018) and teicoplanin (p < 0.0001) separately were both highly significant. spearman's correlation coefficient indicated a strong correlation between the two variables (rho = 0.8). conclusion: overall usage of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones or third generation  cephalosporins contributed to the emergence of vre in the hospital setting.

TI  == effect of in-feed administration and withdrawal of tylosin phosphate on antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from feedlot steers.
AB  == tylosin phosphate is a macrolide commonly administered to cattle in north america for the control of liver abscesses. this study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of tylosin phosphate to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an indicator bacterium. fecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics  and steers administered tylosin phosphate (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 days and withdrawn 28 days before slaughter. enterococcus species isolated from fecal samples were identified through sequencing the groes-el intergenic spacer region  and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. tylosin increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) enterococci within the population. just prior to its removal, the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) resistant enterococci began decreasing and continued to decrease after tylosin was withdrawn from the diet until there was no difference (p > 0.05) between treatments on d 225. this suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter  contributes to a reduction in the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. among the 504 enterococci isolates characterized, enterococcus hirae was found to predominate (n = 431), followed by enterococcus villorum (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 21), enterococcus durans (n = 7), enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4), enterococcus mundtii (n = 4), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 3), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), and enterococcus thailandicus  (n = 1). the diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. erythromycin resistant isolates harbored the erm(b) and/or msrc gene. similar pfge profiles of ery(r) e. hirae pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggest that increased abundance of ery(r) enterococci after administration of tylosin phosphate reflects selection for strains that were already present within the gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival.

TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == diversity of enterococcal species and characterization of high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci of samples of wastewater and surface water in tunisia.
AB  == one hundred-fourteen samples of wastewater (n=64) and surface-water (n=50) were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in sb media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (20%), enterococcus hirae (9.4%), enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus durans (2.4%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-iiia (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(b) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(m) (n=6)/tet(m)-tet(l) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(a) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in sb-gen or sb plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; hlr-g isolates were identified as e. faecium (n=7), e. faecalis (n=6), and e. casseliflavus (n=2). these hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and erm(b) genes, in addition to aph(3')-iiia  (n=10), ant(6)-ia (n=9), tet(m) (n=13), tet(l) (n=8) and cat(a) genes (n=2). three hlr-g enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. sequence-types detected among hlr-g enterococci were as follows: e. faecalis (st480, st314, st202, st55,  and the new ones st531 and st532) and e. faecium (st327, st12, st296, and the new ones st985 and st986). thirty-two different pfge patterns were detected among 36  high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. diverse genetic lineages of hlr-g enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in tunisia. water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.

TI  == a novel termini analysis theory using hts data alone for the identification of enterococcus phage ef4-like genome termini.
AB  == background: enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are typical enterococcal bacterial pathogens. antibiotic resistance means that the identification of novel e. faecalis and e. faecium phages against antibiotic-resistant enterococcus have an important impact on public health. in this study, the e. faecalis phage ime-ef4, e. faecium phage ime-efm1, and both their hosts were antibiotic resistant. to characterize the genome termini of these two phages, a termini analysis theory was developed to provide a wealth of  terminal sequence information directly, using only high-throughput sequencing (hts) read frequency statistics. results: the complete genome sequences of phages ime-ef4 and ime-efm1 were determined, and our termini analysis theory was used to determine the genome termini of these two phages. results showed 9 bp 3' protruding cohesive ends in both ime-ef4 and ime-efm1 genomes by analyzing frequencies of hts reads. for the positive strands of their genomes, the 9 nt 3'  protruding cohesive ends are 5'-tcatcaccg-3' (ime-ef4) and 5'-gggtcagcg-3' (ime-efm1). further experiments confirmed these results. these experiments included mega-primer polymerase chain reaction sequencing, terminal run-off sequencing, and adaptor ligation followed by run-off sequencing. conclusion: using this termini analysis theory, the termini of two newly isolated antibiotic-resistant enterococcus phages, ime-ef4 and ime-efm1, were identified as the byproduct of hts. molecular biology experiments confirmed the identification. because it does not require time-consuming wet lab termini analysis experiments, the termini analysis theory is a fast and easy means of identifying phage dna genome termini using hts read frequency statistics alone. it may aid understanding of phage dna packaging.

TI  == the mazef toxin-antitoxin system as an attractive target in clinical isolates of  enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the toxin-antitoxin (ta) system is a regulatory system where two sets of genes encode the toxin and its corresponding antitoxin. in this study, the prevalence of ta systems in independently isolated clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was determined, the dominant ta system was identified,  different virulence genes in e. faecium and e. faecalis were surveyed, the level  of expression of the virulence and ta genes in normal and stress conditions was determined, and finally their associations with the ta genes were defined. remarkably, the analysis demonstrated higba and mazef in all clinical isolates, and their locations were on chromosomes and plasmids, respectively. on the other  hand, a quantitative analysis of ta and virulence genes revealed that the expression level in both genes is different under normal and stress conditions. the results obtained by anti-mazf peptide nucleic acids demonstrated that the expression level of virulence genes had decreased. these findings demonstrate an  association between ta systems and virulence factors. the mazef on the plasmids and the higba ta genes on the chromosomes of all e. faecium and e. faecalis strains were dominant. additionally, there was a decrease in the expression of virulence genes in the presence of anti-mazf peptide nucleic acids. therefore, it is suggested that mazef ta systems are potent and sensitive targets in all e. faecium and e. faecalis strains.

TI  == [bloodstream infections in southwestern china: 2012 whire union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. methods: blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the whire union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using whonet5. 5 and spss19.0. results: a total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 gram-positive (50.26%); 868 gram-negative (49.74%). coagulase-negative staphylococcius (cns, 541 strains, 31.00%), escherichia coli (eco, 379 strains, 21.72%), klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and staphylococcus aureus (sau, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of s. aureus and 85.4% of cns, respectively. zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9%  resistance to linezolid, respectively. imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% e. coli, 3.6% klebsiella spp., and 11.1% enterobacter spp.. nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in p.  aeruginosa and 79.1% in acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for mrsa and multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections. patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections than others. conclusion: cns, e. coli,klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp. and s. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in southwestern china. low methicillin-resistant rate was found in staphylococcus aureus. but vancomycin-resistant rate was high in e. faecium. imipenem-resistant rates varied in enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in acinetobacter spp. use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.

TI  == prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineages of enterococcus spp from vegetable food, soil and irrigation water in farm environments in tunisia.
AB  == background: the objective was to determine the species, clonal diversity, antibiotic resistance and virulence in enterococci of different environments. seventy-one samples of farm origin (34 of food-vegetables, 27 of soil and 10 of irrigation water), and 19 samples of vegetables of 5 markets were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. results: enterococci were obtained from 72.2% of tested samples in sb media (food-vegetables from farm, 88.2%; soil and irrigation water, 51%; food-vegetables from market, 84.2%), and 65 enterococcal isolates were obtained. e. faecium was the most prevalent species (52.3%), followed by e. hirae (35.4%), e. faecalis (6.15%), and e. casseliflavus  (6.15%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci were [percentage/detected gene]: ciprofloxacin [60%], erythromycin [18.4%/erm(b)], tetracycline [15.4%/tet(m)-tet(l)], kanamycin [15.4%/aph(3')-iii], chloramphenicol [7.7%], streptomycin [3%/ant(6)], vancomycin [6.15%/vanc2)], and  teicoplanin and ampicillin [0%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were detected in sb-gen plates in 14 of 90 tested samples (15.5%), and 15 isolates were characterized: 10 e. faecalis, 4 e. faecium and 1 e. hirae.  all hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-aph(2"), erm(b) and tet(m) genes, among other resistance genes. the hlr-g isolates showed high genetic diversity (10 different pfge-profiles), and were ascribed to the sequence-types: e. faecalis (st2, st16, st28, and the new st528); e. faecium (st56, st885, and st886). conclusion: food-vegetables at the farm or market setting are frequently contaminated by hlr-g enterococci and these microorganisms could reach the human  intestine through the food chain, if hygienic conditions are not followed.

TI  == clinical outcomes of daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia.
AB  == purpose: in light of recent evidence suggesting enhancement of daptomycin activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) by ampicillin and other  beta-lactam antibiotics, we evaluated the safety profile and clinical efficacy of daptomycin with and without concomitant beta-lactam antimicrobials in the treatment of vre (faecium or faecalis) bacteremia from multiple centers across the united states. methods: data were collected retrospectively as part of a larger multicenter registry (the cubicin outcomes registry and experience). efficacy and clinical outcomes in patients with vre bacteremia who received at least 3 days of daptomycin with or without concomitant beta-lactams were analyzed. although all the cases involved daptomycin-susceptible vre, additional  analysis was performed to examine whether the adjunctive beta-lactam would play a more pivotal role in cases where the daptomycin mic was in the upper limit of the susceptibility range, indicating that daptomycin monotherapy efficacy may be relatively compromised compared with cases with lower daptomycin mics. findings:  two hundred sixty-two patients from 33 hospitals were evaluated. most patients had at least one significant comorbidity, such as solid-organ or bone marrow transplantation (16%), neutropenia (36%), dialysis dependency (20%), or critical  illness (36%) requiring care in an intensive care unit. overall treatment success was 86% (n = 225/262), and treatment success for patients taking concomitant beta-lactams was 86% (n = 105/122). logistic regression identified treatment failure to be associated with sepsis (odds ratio = 3.42; p = 0.009) and an elevated daptomycin mic (3-4 microg/ml) (odds ratio = 3.23, p = 0.013). no significant increase in clinical failure was seen among patients with elevated daptomycin mic who received concomitant beta-lactam therapy (clinical success, 88% vs 79% for mic </=2 vs 3-4 microg/ml, respectively; p = 0.417). of 262 patients, 33 (13%) experienced >/=1 adverse event possibly related to daptomycin  (increased creatine kinase in 8 patients). implications: overall, daptomycin was  effective and well tolerated for vre bacteremia, with lower effectiveness noted with daptomycin mic of 3 to 4 microg/ml. concomitant beta-lactam therapy with daptomycin may improve clinical outcomes in this setting. further studies are needed to characterize the potential benefit of concomitant beta-lactams with daptomycin.

TI  == a novel gene, optra, that confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols and its presence in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium of human and animal origin.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone-resistant enterococcus faecalis e349 from a human patient tested negative for the cfr gene and 23s rrna mutations. here we report the identification of a novel oxazolidinone resistance gene, optra, and a first investigation of the extent to which this gene was present in e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium from humans and food-producing animals. methods: the resistance gene optra was identified by whole-plasmid sequencing and subsequent cloning and expression in a susceptible enterococcus host. transformation and conjugation assays served to investigate the transferability of optra. all optra-positive e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates of human and animal origin were analysed for their mics and their genotype, as well as the location of optra. results: the novel plasmid-borne abc transporter gene optra from e. faecalis e349 conferred combined resistance or elevated mics (when no clinical breakpoints were available) to oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol). the corresponding conjugative plasmid pe349, on which optra was located, had a size of 36 331 bp and also carried the phenicol exporter gene fexa. the optra gene was functionally expressed in e. faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus. it was detected more frequently in e. faecalis and e. faecium from food-producing animals (20.3%  and 5.7%, respectively) than from humans (4.2% and 0.6%, respectively). conclusions: enterococci with elevated mics of linezolid and tedizolid should be  tested not only for 23s rrna mutations and the gene cfr, but also for the novel resistance gene optra.

TI  == molecular characterization of resistance, virulence and clonality in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis: a hospital-based study in beijing, china.
AB  == the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in china is increasing,  the molecular epidemiology of vre in china is only partly known. this study was conducted to assess the molecular characterization of resistance, virulence and clonality of 69 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrefm) and seven vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vrefs) isolates obtained from a chinese hospital between july 2011 and july 2013. the glycopeptide resistance genes (vana and vanb) were screened by multiplex pcr. the presence of five putative virulence genes (esp, gele, asa1, hyl and cyla) were evaluated by another multiplex pcr. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme was used to assess the clonality. all 76 vre isolates exhibited vana phenotype and harbored vana gene. esp was the only gene detected both in vrefm and vrefs strains, accounting for 89.9% and 42.9%, respectively. the hyl gene was merely positive in 27.5% of vrefm strains. mlst analysis demonstrated three sts (st6, st4 and st470) in vrefs and twelve sts (st78, st571, st17, st564, st389, st18, st547, st341, st414, st343, st262 and st203) in vrefm, which were all designated as cc17 by eburst algorithm. an outbreak of vrefm belonging to st571 was found to happen within the neurology ward in this hospital. to our knowledge, this is the first report of st6 (cc2) vrefs strains in china and the first outbreak report of vrefm strains belonging to st571 around the world. our data could offer important information for understanding the molecular features of vre in china.

TI  == small hospitals matter: insights from the emergence and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in 2 public hospitals in inner brazil.
AB  == although vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are reported in brazil since 1996, data on their impact over settings of different complexity are scarce. we performed a study aimed at identifying determinants of vre emergence and spread in a public hospital consortium (comprising 2 hospitals, with 318 and 57 beds) in inner brazil. molecular typing and case-control studies (addressing predictors of acquisition or clonality) were performed. among 122 authocthonous isolates, 106 were enterococcus faecium (22 clones), and 16, enterococcus faecalis (5 clones).  incidence was greater in the small-sized hospital, and a previous admission to this hospital was associated with greater risk of vre colonization or infection during admission to the larger one. overall risk factors included comorbidities,  procedures, and antimicrobials (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and imipenem). risk factors varied among different hospitals, species, and clones. our findings  demonstrate that vre can spread within low-complexity facilities and from these to larger hospitals.

TI  == review of enterococci isolated from canine and feline urine specimens from 2006 to 2011.
AB  == canine and feline urine culture reports and medical records were reviewed at a veterinary teaching hospital from 2006 to 2011 for enterococcal growth, coinfections, antimicrobial resistance, urine sediment findings, clinical signs,  and concurrent conditions. of all of the urine specimens with significantly defined colony-forming units/ml, enterococcus (e.) faecalis was the only enterococci isolated from cats and predominated (77.4%) in dogs followed by e. faecium (12.9%), e. durans (3.2%), and other enterococcus spp. (6.5%). the majority of specimens with significant enterococcal growth resulted in complicated urinary tract infections in 83.9% of dogs and 81.8% of cats. specimens with only enterococcal growth were more common than those mixed with other bacterial species. cocci were observed in urine sediments of 8 out of 8 cats and 21 out of 25 dogs with available concurrent urinalyses. pyuria was noted in 5 out of 8 feline and 15 out of 25 canine urine sediments, and pyuria in dogs  was associated with growth of only enterococci on aerobic urine culture. multidrug resistance was identified in 6 out of 11 cats and 7 out of 31 dogs, and e. faecium isolates from dogs were 4.5x more likely to be multidrug resistant than e. faecalis .

TI  == characterization of an enterococcus gallinarum carrying dual vana and vanb cassette.
AB  == the ability of vancomycin resistance determinants to be horizontally transferred  within enterococci species is a concern. identification and characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in a clinical isolate has a significant impact on infection control practices. in this study, we describe a clinical isolate of e. gallinarum exhibiting high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. genetic characterization of this isolate showed the presence of vana and vanb genes in addition to naturally carrying vanc gene. vana was identified on pa6981, a 35,608-bp circular plasmid with significant homology to plasmid ps177. vanb operon was integrated into the bacterial chromosome and showed high level of homology to previously reported tn1549 and tn5382. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of e. gallinarum carrying both vana and vanb  operons, indicating the importance of identifying vancomycin resistance mechanism in non- e. faecium and -e. faecalis enterococcal species.

TI  == mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in clostridium difficile and enterococcus species.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is an urgent public health concern causing  considerable clinical and economic burdens. cdi can be treated with antibiotics,  but recurrence of the disease following successful treatment of the initial episode often occurs. surotomycin is a rapidly bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is in clinical trials for cdi treatment and that has demonstrated superiority over vancomycin in preventing cdi relapse. surotomycin is a structural analogue of the membrane-active antibiotic daptomycin. previously, we  utilized in vitro serial passage experiments to derive c. difficile strains with  reduced surotomycin susceptibilities. the parent strains used included atcc 700057 and clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) groups bi and k. serial passage experiments were also performed with vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. the goal of this study is to identify mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in c. difficile and enterococci. illumina sequence data generated for the parent strains and serial passage isolates were compared. we identified nonsynonymous mutations in genes coding for cardiolipin synthase in c. difficile atcc 700057, enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase ii (fabk) and cell division protein ftsh2 in c. difficile rea type bi, and a padr family transcriptional regulator in c. difficile rea type k. among the 4 enterococcal strain pairs, 20 mutations were identified, and those mutations overlap those associated with daptomycin resistance. these data give insight into the mechanism of action of surotomycin against c. difficile, possible mechanisms  for resistance emergence during clinical use, and the potential impacts of surotomycin therapy on intestinal enterococci.

TI  == genotypic variations of virulent genes in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolated from three hospitals in malaysia.
AB  == background: the genus enterococcus is of increasing significance as a cause of nosocomial infections, and this trend is exacerbated by the development of antibiotic resistance. objectives: the aim of the present study was to estimate the potential virulence factors in enterococci and to ascertain their prevalence  in malaysian hospitals. material and methods: the study comprised 222 enterococcal strains isolated from blood, urine, exudates, sputum, stool and body fluid. these strains were collected from patients staying in three referral hospitals in malaysia. all isolates were identified to the species level, and their mic of vancomycin was determined using e test strips. specific primers were designed for detection of the five potential virulence genes (gele, pai, esp, ace, and spre) by pcr assay. results: different patterns and frequency of virulence determinants were found for the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates. e. faecalis isolates had more virulence determinants than e. faecium isolates. clinical enterococcal isolates were found to possess more virulence determinants  than enterococci isolated from faecal samples. the esp gene is significantly more common (p = 0.049) in vancomycin-resistant strains (85.7%) than in vancomycin-sensitive strains (44.2%). all of the vancomycin-resistant isolates were isolated from faecal samples. none of the classical virulence factors were found in 11% of enterococcal isolates, while all five virulence genes were found  in 21% of enterococcal isolates. conclusions: all the virulence genes considered  in this study were important in the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections and further studies including more virulence genes and epidemiological data will be necessary in order to analyze the association and role of virulence genes in the  pathogencity of enterococci.

TI  == tyrosine decarboxylase activity of enterococci grown in media with different nutritional potential: tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine accumulation and tyrdc gene expression.
AB  == the ability to accumulate tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine by two strains of enterococcus faecalis and two strains enterococcus faecium was evaluated in two cultural media added or not with tyrosine. all the enterococcal strains possessed a tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrdc) which determined tyramine accumulation in all the conditions tested, independently on the addition of high concentration of free tyrosine. enterococci differed in rate and level of biogenic amines accumulation. e. faecalis ef37 and e. faecium fc12 produced tyramine in high amount since the exponential growth phase, while 2-phenylethylamine was accumulated when tyrosine was depleted. e. faecium fc12 and e. faecalis atcc 29212 showed a slower tyraminogenic activity which took place mainly in the stationary phase up to 72 h of incubation. moreover, e. faecalis atcc 29212 produced 2-phenylethylamine only in the media without tyrosine added. in bhi added or not with tyrosine the tyrdc gene expression level differed considerably  depending on the strains and the growth phase. in particular, the tyrdc gene expression was high during the exponential phase in rich medium for all the strains and subsequently decreased except for e. faecium fc12. even if tyrdc presence is common among enterococci, this study underlines the extremely variable decarboxylating potential of strains belonging to the same species, suggesting strain-dependent implications in food safety.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == investigating the mobilome in clinically important lineages of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background: the success of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis evolving as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens is associated with their ability to acquire  and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes encoded by mobile genetic elements (mges). here, we investigate this mobilome in successful  hospital associated genetic lineages, e. faecium sequence type (st)17 (n=10) and  st78 (n=10), e. faecalis st6 (n=10) and st40 (n=10) by dna microarray analyses. results: the hybridization patterns of 272 representative targets including plasmid backbones (n=85), transposable elements (n=85), resistance determinants (n=67), prophages (n=29) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas sequences (n=6) separated the strains according to species,  and for e. faecalis also according to sts. rcr-, rep_3-, repa_n- and inc18-family plasmids were highly prevalent and with the exception of rep_3, evenly distributed between the species. there was a considerable difference in the replicon profile, with rep 17/prum , rep 2/pre25 , rep 14/efnp1 and rep 20/plg1 dominating in e. faecium and rep 9/pcf10 , rep 2/pre25 and rep 7 in e. faecalis strains. we observed an overall high correlation between the presence and absence of genes coding for resistance towards antibiotics, metals, biocides and their corresponding mges as well as their phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. although most is families were represented in both e. faecalis and e. faecium, specific is elements within these families were distributed in only one  species. the prevalence of is256-, is3-, isl3-, is200/is605-, is110-, is982- and  is4-transposases was significantly higher in e. faecium than e. faecalis, and that of is110-, is982- and is1182-transposases in e. faecalis st6 compared to st40. notably, the transposases of is981, isefm1 and is1678 that have only been reported in few enterococcal isolates were well represented in the e. faecium strains. e. faecalis st40 strains harboured possible functional crispr-cas systems, and still resistance and prophage sequences were generally well represented. conclusions: the targeted mges were highly prevalent among the selected sts, underlining their potential importance in the evolution of hospital-adapted lineages of enterococci. although the propensity of inter-species horizontal gene transfer (hgt) must be emphasized, the considerable species-specificity of these mges indicates a separate vertical evolution of mges within each species, and for e. faecalis within each st.

TI  == genetic relatedness and risk factor analysis of ampicillin-resistant and high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci causing bloodstream infections in tanzanian children.
AB  == background: while enterococci resistant to multiple antimicrobials are spreading  in hospitals worldwide, causing urinary tract, wound and bloodstream infections,  there is little published data on these infections from africa. methods: we assessed the prevalence, susceptibility patterns, clinical outcome and genetic relatedness of enterococcal isolates causing bloodstream infections in children in a tertiary hospital in tanzania, as part of a prospective cohort study of bloodstream infections among 1828 febrile children admitted consecutively from august 2001 to august 2002. results: enterococcal bacteraemia was identified in 2.1% (39/1828) of admissions, and in 15.3% (39/255) of cases of culture-confirmed bloodstream infections. the case-fatality rate in children with enterococcus faecalis septicaemia (28.6%, 4/14) was not significantly different from those with enterococcus faecium septicaemia (6.7%, 1/15, p = 0.12). e. faecium isolates commonly had combined ampicillin-resistance and high-level gentamicin resistance  (hlgr), (9/17), while e. faecalis frequently displayed hlgr (6/15), but were ampicillin susceptible. none of the tested enterococcal isolates displayed vancomycin resistance by etest or pcr for vana and vanb genes. multi-locus sequence-typing (mlst) showed that the majority of e. faecium (7/12) belonged to  the hospital associated bayesian analysis of population structure (baps) group 3-3. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) indicated close genetic relationship particularly among e. faecium isolates, but also among e. faecalis isolates. there was also correlation between baps group and pfge results. risk factors for  enterococcal bloodstream infection in univariate analysis were hospital-acquired  infection and clinical diagnosis of sepsis with unknown focus. in multivariate analysis, neonates in general were relatively protected from enterococcal infection, while both prematurity and clinical sepsis were risk factors. malnutrition was a risk factor for enterococcal bloodstream infection among hiv negative children. conclusion: this is the first study to describe bloodstream infections caused by ampicillin-resistant hlgr e. faecium and hlgr e. faecalis in tanzania. the isolates of e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively, showed high degrees of relatedness by genotyping using pfge. the commonly used treatment regimens at the hospital are insufficient for infections caused by these microbes. the study results call for increased access to microbiological diagnostics to guide rational antibiotic use in tanzania.

TI  == dissemination of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a ricotta processing plant and evaluation of pathogenic and antibiotic resistance profiles.
AB  == in this work, the sources of contamination by enterococcus spp. in a ricotta processing line were evaluated. the isolated strains were tested for virulence genes (gele, cyla,b, m, esp, agg, ace, efaa, vanb), expression of virulence factors (hemolysin and gelatinase), and the resistance to 10 different antibiotics. enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were subjected to discriminatory identification by intergenic spacer region (its)-polymerase chain  reaction and sequencing of the its region. the results showed that enterococcus spp. was detected in the raw materials, environment samples and the final product. none of the 107 enterococcus isolates were completely free from all virulence genes considered. a fraction of 21.5% of the isolates containing all of the genes of the cyla, b, m operon also expressed beta-hemolysis. most of the isolates showed the gele gene, but only 9.3% were able to hydrolyze gelatin. in addition, 23.5% of the observed enterococcus isolates had the vanb gene but were  susceptible to vancomycin in vitro. the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant enterococci was revealed in this study: 19.3% of the e. faecium samples and 78.0% of the e. faecalis samples were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested. sequencing of region discriminated 5 and 7 distinct groups among e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. although some similarity was observed among some of the isolates, all e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates had genetic differences both in the its region and in the virulence profile, which makes them different from each other.

TI  == prevalence, resistance patterns, and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from retail chicken meat in colombia.
AB  == as a step toward implementing the colombian integrated program for antimicrobial  resistance surveillance (coipars), this study aimed to establish the baseline antimicrobial resistance patterns of salmonella serovars, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. isolates in retail poultry meat from independent stores and from a main chain distributor center. mics of the isolates were determined for antimicrobials used both in humans and animals, using an automated system. salmonella serovars were isolated from 26% of the meat samples and e. coli from 83%, whereas enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were detected in 81 and 13% of the meat samples, respectively. a principal finding of concern in this study was that almost 98% of isolates tested were multidrug resistant. ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline were the antimicrobials that showed the highest frequency of resistance among salmonella and e. coli isolates. for enterococci, 61.5% of e. faecium isolates were found to be resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin; this is significant because it is used to treat nosocomial infections when vancomycin resistance is present. vancomycin resistance was detected in 4% of the e. faecalis isolates. the results of our study highlight the need for rapid implementation of an integrated program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance by the colombian authorities in order to monitor trends, raise awareness, and help promote practices to safeguard later generation antimicrobial agents.

TI  == auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox  homeostasis.
AB  == infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. from a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable fda-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating m. tuberculosis. we also found that auranofin is active against other gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis and enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. auranofin  decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection. these results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent  auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are frequently resistant to vancomycin and beta-lactams. in enterococcal infections with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility, combination therapy is often administered. our objective was to conduct pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) models to evaluate beta-lactam synergy with daptomycin (dap) against resistant enterococci. one e. faecalis strain (r6981) and two e. faecium strains (r6370 and 8019) were evaluated. dap mics were obtained. all strains were evaluated for response to ll37, an antimicrobial peptide, in the presence and absence of ceftaroline (cpt), ertapenem (ert), and ampicillin (amp). after 96 h, in vitro models were run simulating 10 mg dap/kg body weight/day, 600 mg cpt every 8 h (q8h), 2 g amp q4h, and 1 g ert q24h, both alone and in combination against all strains. dap mics were 2, 4, and 4 mug/ml for strains r6981, r6370, and 8019, respectively. pk/pd models demonstrated bactericidal activity with dap-cpt, dap-amp, and dap-ert combinations against strain 8019 (p < 0.001 and log10 cfu/ml reduction of >2 compared to any single agent). against strains r6981 and r6370, the dap-amp combination demonstrated enhancement against r6370 but not r6981, while the combinations of dap-cpt and dap-ert were bactericidal, demonstrated enhancement,  and were statistically superior to all other regimens at 96 h (p < 0.001) against both strains. cpt, ert, and amp similarly augmented ll37 killing against strain 8019. in strains r6981 and r6370, cpt and ert aided ll37 more than amp (p < 0.001). compared to dap alone, combination regimens provide better killing and prevent resistance. clinical research involving dap combinations is warranted.

TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == is it safe to reuse dental implant healing abutments sterilized and serviced by dealers of dental implant manufacturers? an in vitro sterility analysis.
AB  == purpose: this study was undertaken to investigate the sterility of used healing abutments sterilized and serviced by dealers of dental implant manufacturers. materials and methods: sixty used but sterilized healing abutments in sealed sterilization pouches were obtained from 6 manufacturers unaware of the study design and equally grouped from a to f. the sterilization pouches were examined for perforation. the driver slots and screw grooves of healing abutments were examined for calculus and scratches under a x5 led magnifying lamp, without opening the pouches. each abutment was immersed in brain heart infusion broth in  test tubes and incubated. results: macroscopic observation of 57 healing abutments revealed dirty screw grooves (10.5%) and partially filled driver slots  (5.2%). none of the group c, e, and f samples showed turbidity. penicillium variabile was morphologically identified in 3 abutments of group a. enterococcus  faecalis and e faecium were detected in 1 abutment each of groups b and d, respectively. conclusion: reuse of healing abutments can be cost effective in dental practice. however, used abutments sterilized and serviced by dental implant dealers might be a source of cross-infection. they should therefore be cleaned and resterilized before reuse as a precaution.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enteroccus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolated from education hospital of iran.
AB  == introduction: enterococci are opportunistic pathogens which represent one of the  leading agents of nosocomial infections, especially urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients. the aim of the present study was to determine the resistance pattern and the type of resistance genes in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolated from an educational hospital in iran. materials and methods: from february 2012 till february 2013, one hundred and eighty six clinical isolates from different department of educational hospitals were collected and identified as enterococci and specified by biochemical tests. identification was confirmed by specific pcr. antibiotic resistance properties of strains were examined by kerby-bauer method. pcr was performed for ddle, ddlf, vana and vanb genes. results: one hundred and six (57%) isolates were identified  as e. faecalis and 80 (43%) of the isolates were identified as e. faecium. 24 isolates had vana gene and 19 isolates had vanb genes. in e. faecalis isolates, 15 isolates had vanb and 4 isolates had vana gene. in e. faecium isolates, 20 isolates had vana and 4 isolates had vanb gene. prevalence of van genes between e. faecalis and e. faecium were significantly different for both vana and vanb (p<0.01, p<0.041, respectively). vre isolates were sensitive to linezolid, nitrofurantoin and tigecyclin. discussion: the overall prevalence of vre was 23.65%, which shows an increase in vre isolation in our region. also, prevalence  of e. faecium dramatically increased from 9% to 43% in the present study. also increase in gentamicin resistant isolates observed, but vre isolates were sensitive to linezolid, tigecyclin and nitrofurantoin. stewardships for antibiotic usage in hospitals, especially for last option antibiotics, can prevent the spread of resistant isolates and losing all treatment options in the  future.

TI  == biofilms of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from the processing of ricotta and the control of these pathogens through cleaning and sanitization procedures.
AB  == the biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated  from the processing of ricotta on stainless steel coupons was evaluated, and the  effect of cleaning and sanitization procedures in the control of these biofilms was determined. the formation of biofilms was observed while varying the incubation temperature (7, 25 and 39 degrees c) and time (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days). at 7 degrees c, the counts of e. faecalis and e. faecium were below 2 log10 cfu/cm(2). for the temperatures of 25 and 39 degrees c, after 1 day, the counts of e. faecalis and e. faecium were 5.75 and 6.07 log10 cfu/cm(2), respectively, which is characteristic of biofilm formation. the tested sanitation procedures a) acid-anionic tensioactive cleaning, b) anionic tensioactive cleaning+sanitizer and c) acid-anionic tensioactive cleaning+sanitizer were effective in removing the biofilms, reducing the counts to levels below 0.4 log10 cfu/cm(2). the sanitizer biguanide was the least effective, and peracetic acid was the most effective. these studies revealed the ability of enterococci to form biofilms and the importance of the cleaning step and the type of sanitizer used in sanitation processes for the effective removal of biofilms.

TI  == targeting enterococcus faecalis biofilms with phage therapy.
AB  == phage therapy has been proven to be more effective, in some cases, than conventional antibiotics, especially regarding multidrug-resistant biofilm infections. the objective here was to isolate an anti-enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage and to evaluate its efficacy against planktonic and biofilm cultures. e. faecalis is an important pathogen found in many infections, including endocarditis and persistent infections associated with root canal treatment failure. the difficulty in e. faecalis treatment has been attributed to the lack of anti-infective strategies to eradicate its biofilm and to the frequent emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. to this end, an anti-e. faecalis and e. faecium phage, termed efdg1, was isolated from sewage effluents.  the phage was visualized by electron microscopy. efdg1 coding sequences and phylogeny were determined by whole genome sequencing (genbank accession number kp339049), revealing it belongs to the spounavirinae subfamily of the myoviridae  phages, which includes promising candidates for therapy against gram-positive pathogens. this analysis also showed that the efdg1 genome does not contain apparent harmful genes. efdg1 antibacterial efficacy was evaluated in vitro against planktonic and biofilm cultures, showing effective lytic activity against various e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, regardless of their antibiotic resistance profile. in addition, efdg1 efficiently prevented ex vivo e. faecalis  root canal infection. these findings suggest that phage therapy using efdg1 might be efficacious to prevent e. faecalis infection after root canal treatment.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes in a multi-species biofilm with enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and control through sanitation procedures.
AB  == the formation of mono-species biofilm (listeria monocytogenes) and multi-species  biofilms (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and l. monocytogenes) was  evaluated. in addition, the effectiveness of sanitation procedures for the control of the multi-species biofilm also was evaluated. the biofilms were grown  on stainless steel coupons at various incubation temperatures (7, 25 and 39 degrees c) and contact times (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days). in all tests, at 7 degrees c, the microbial counts were below 0.4 log cfu/cm(2) and not characteristic of biofilms. in mono-species biofilm, the counts of l. monocytogenes after 8 days of contact were 4.1 and 2.8 log cfu/cm(2) at 25 and 39 degrees c, respectively. in the multi-species biofilms, enterococcus spp. were present at counts of 8 log cfu/cm(2) at 25 and 39 degrees c after 8 days of contact. however, the l. monocytogenes in multi-species biofilms was significantly affected by the presence of enterococcus spp. and by temperature. at 25 degrees c, the growth of l. monocytogenes biofilms was favored in multi-species cultures, with counts above 6 log cfu/cm(2) after 8 days of contact. in contrast, at 39 degrees c, a negative effect was observed for l. monocytogenes biofilm growth in mixed cultures, with a significant reduction in counts over time and values below 0.4 log cfu/cm(2) starting at day 4. anionic tensioactive cleaning complemented with another procedure (acid cleaning, disinfection or acid cleaning+disinfection) eliminated the multi-species biofilms under all conditions tested (counts of all micro-organisms<0.4 log cfu/cm(2)). peracetic acid was the most effective disinfectant, eliminating the multi-species biofilms under all tested conditions (counts of the all microorganisms <0.4 log cfu/cm(2)). in contrast, biguanide was the least effective disinfectant, failing  to eliminate biofilms under all the test conditions.

TI  == horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from enterococcus faecium of fermented meat origin to clinical isolates of e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus species are part of the normal intestinal flora of a large number of mammals including humans and consequently, they can be used as indicators of faecal contamination in food and water for human consumption. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. in the present study, enterococcus spp., isolated from commercially fermented meat and human clinical specimen were studied to determine genetic relationships. smai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns exhibited genomic heterogeneity within and between both groups of isolates. however, in spite of this heterogeneity there were still substantial phenotypic similarities which suggested that food might be a potential vehicle for distribution of resistant bacteria among humans. in vitro conjugation experiments demonstrated transfer of  the tetracycline resistant determinant, tet(m), from enterococcus faecium s27 isolated from fermented sausage to clinical isolates of both e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis. the streptomycin resistance of e. faecium s27 was also transferred to a clinical strain, e. faecalis 82916, which was confirmed by the presence of the streptomycin resistance gene, aada, in the donor and transconjugant strains. since the aada gene is associated with a class 1 integron, results also suggested that resistance transfer might have occurred via an integron. it appears this is the first identification of a class 1 integron in e. faecium isolated from food. the importance of food enterococci as a reservoir  of antibiotic resistance genes and the potential for their genetic transfer to human strains following consumption of uncooked or undercooked contaminated meat  is underlined by this work.

TI  == detection of vancomycin resistances in enterococci within 3 (1/2) hours.
AB  == vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) constitute a challenging problem in health care institutions worldwide. novel methods to rapidly identify resistances are highly required to ensure an early start of tailored therapy and to prevent further spread of the bacteria. here, a spectroscopy-based rapid test is presented that reveals resistances of enterococci towards vancomycin within 3.5 hours. without any specific knowledge on the strain, vre can be recognized with high accuracy in two different enterococci species. by means of dielectrophoresis, bacteria are directly captured from dilute suspensions, making sample preparation very easy. raman spectroscopic analysis of the trapped bacteria over a time span of two hours in absence and presence of antibiotics reveals characteristic differences in the molecular response of sensitive as well as resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. furthermore, the spectroscopic fingerprints provide an indication on the mechanisms of induced resistance in vre.

AB  == the dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (args) (blavim-1, vana, ampc, ermb, and meca) and opportunistic bacteria (enterococcus faecium/faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and cns) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of germany. over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total dna extracted from water  samples and per 100 ml sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance  of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. high abundances of opportunistic bacteria and arg were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent wwtp. the removal capacities of wwtp were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. the abundances of most arg targets were  found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. as a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four args. it became obvious that the dynamics of the arg differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. this underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.

TI  == australian enterococcal sepsis outcome programme annual report, 2013.
AB  == from 1 january to 31 december 2013, 26 institutions around australia participated in the australian enterococcal sepsis outcome programme (aesop). the aim of aesop 2013 was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteraemia isolates in australia that are antimicrobial resistant, and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of the enterococcus faecium isolates. of the 826 unique episodes of  bacteraemia investigated, 94.6% were caused by either e. faecalis (56.1%) or e. faecium (38.5%). ampicillin resistance was not detected in e. faecalis but was detected in over 90% of e. faecium. vancomycin non-susceptibility was reported in 0.2% and 40.9% of e. faecalis and e. faecium respectively and was predominately due to the acquisition of the vanb operon. overall, 41.6% of e. faecium harboured vana or vanb genes. the percentage of e. faecium bacteraemia isolates resistant to vancomycin in australia is significantly higher than that seen in most european countries. e. faecium isolates consisted of 81 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pulsotypes of which 72.3% were classified into 14 major pulsotypes containing five or more isolates. multilocus sequence typing grouped the 14 major pulsotypes into clonal cluster 17, a major hospital-adapted polyclonal e. faecium cluster. of the 2 predominant sequence types, st203 (80 isolates) was identified across australia and st555 (40 isolates) was isolated primarily in the western and central regions (northern territory, south australia and western australia) respectively. in conclusion, the aesop 2013 has shown enterococcal bacteraemias in australia are frequently caused by polyclonal ampicillin-resistant high-level gentamicin resistant vanb e. faecium, which have  limited treatment options.

TI  == update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == a revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda). telavancin activity was assessed against gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. a total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the telavancin international surveillance program for the americas, europe, and asia-pacific. telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/ml (revised fda breakpoint). telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) and linezolid (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all 692 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) at </=0.25 mug/ml (fda breakpoint), except for 1 strain (mic, 0.5 mug/ml). all enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis with telavancin mic values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/ml, respectively, had a vana phenotype. a comparison data analysis based on the mic90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. streptococci showed telavancin mic50 values of </=0.015 mug/ml, except for streptococcus agalactiae (mic50, 0.03 mug/ml). these in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == different vana elements in e. faecalis and in e. faecium suggest at least two origins of tn1546 among vre in a brazilian hospital.
AB  == in 2009 during surveillance in a brazilian hospital, many patients were confirmed to be colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and a few infection cases occurred. among 14 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, most had the same pulsotype, virulence profile (agg(+)elra(+)gele(+)), and were sequence type (st)103, indicating dissemination of a clone. the 47 enterococcus faecium were separated into four pulsotypes, the predominant virulence profile being esp(+)acm(+). all of them harbored the hospital marker is16, and three randomly chosen isolates were st412, belonging to the clonal complex 17. e. faecalis were  all susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, while all e. faecium were resistant to them. all isolates were susceptible to daptomycin and tigecycline. there were  no rep-family genes common to all vre. the vana element of all e. faecium lost its left-side inverted repeat (irl) region and had a specific is insertion. on the other hand, all e. faecalis presented intact tn1546. the size of plasmids containing the vana gene as well as its rep-families varied between and within species. the lack of a vana plasmid common to all vre, together with the differences among vana elements, despite the fact that some patients were colonized by both species during their hospitalization, leads us to suggest at least two different tn1546 origins.

AB  == fast and reliable identification of bacteria to at least the species level is currently the basis for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections. this is particularly important in the case of bacteria of the genus enterococcus, whose resistance profile is often correlated with their species (e.g. resistance to vancomycin). in this study, we evaluated restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region for species identification of enterococcus. the utility of the method was compared with that of phenotypic methods [biochemical profile evaluation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms)]. identification was based on 21 enterococcus reference strains, of the species e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. cecorum and e. columbae, and 47 enterococcus field strains isolated from pigs. restriction endonuclease analysis  of the its-pcr product using hinfi, rsai and mboi, in the order specified, enabled species differentiation of the enterococcus reference and field strains,  and in the case of the latter, the results of species identification were identical (47/47) to those obtained by maldi-tof ms. moreover, as a result of digestion with mboi, a unique restriction profile was also obtained for the strains (3/3) identified by maldi-tof ms as e. thailandicus. in our opinion, restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene its region of enterococcus may be a simple and relatively fast (less than 4 h) alternative method for identifying the species occurring most frequently in humans and animals.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == susceptibility of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci to linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, tigecycline and daptomycin in a tertiary greek hospital.
AB  == we investigated the antibiotic susceptibility of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre). seventy consecutive gre were tested. sixty-two isolates were identified as enterococcus faecium (88.6%), and 8 (11.4%) as enterococcus faecalis. all strains were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin, while 17.1% (12/70) and 11.4% (8/70) were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd) and tigecycline, respectively. all e. faecalis isolates were resistant to qd, while 4 of 62 (6.5%) e. faecium isolates were resistant to qd. all e. faecalis isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, while 14.5% (9/62) e. faecium isolates were resistant. continued surveillance of gre antibiotic susceptibilities is important for combating these multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == vancomycin-resistance phenotypes, vancomycin-resistance genes, and resistance to  antibiotics of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin.
AB  == in the present study, 500 raw beef, pork, and chicken meat samples and 100 pooled egg samples were analyzed for the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin-resistance phenotypes, and resistance genes. of 141 isolates of enterococci, 88 strains of enterococcus faecium and 53 strains of e. faecalis were identified. the most prevalent species was e. faecium. resistance to ampicillin (n = 93, 66%), ciprofloxacin (n = 74, 52.5%), erythromycin (n = 73, 51.8%), penicillin (n = 59, 41.8%) and tetracycline (n = 52, 36.9%) was observed, while 53.2% (n = 75) of the isolates were multiresistant and 15.6% (n = 22) were  susceptible to all antibiotics. resistance to vancomycin was exhibited in 34.1% (n = 30) of the e. faecium isolates (n = 88) and 1.9% (n = 1) of the e. faecalis  isolates (n = 53) using the disc-diffusion test and the e-test. all isolates were tested for vana and vanb using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and multiplex pcr, and for vanc, vand, vane, vang genes using multiplex pcr only. among e. faecalis isolates, no resistance genes were identified. among the e. faecium isolates, 28 carried the vana gene when tested by multiplex pcr and 29 when tested with real-time pcr. no isolate carrying the vanc, vand, vane, or vang genes was identified. melting-curve analysis of the positive real-time pcr e. faecium isolates showed that 22 isolates carried the vana gene only, 2 isolates the vanb2,3 genes only, and seven isolates carried both the vana and vanb2,3 genes. enterococci should be considered a significant zoonotic pathogen and a possible reservoir of genes encoding resistance potentially transferred to other  bacterial species.

AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == population biology of intestinal enterococcus isolates from hospitalized and nonhospitalized individuals in different age groups.
AB  == the diversity of enterococcal populations from fecal samples from hospitalized (n = 133) and nonhospitalized individuals (n = 173) of different age groups (group i, ages 0 to 19 years; group ii, ages 20 to 59 years; group iii, ages >/=60 years) was analyzed. enterococci were recovered at similar rates from hospitalized and nonhospitalized persons (77.44% to 79.77%) of all age groups (75.0% to 82.61%). enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were predominant, although seven other enterococcus species were identified. e. faecalis and e. faecium (including ampicillin-resistant e. faecium) colonization  rates in nonhospitalized persons were age independent. for inpatients, e. faecalis colonization rates were age independent, but e. faecium colonization rates (particularly the rates of ampicillin-resistant e. faecium colonization) significantly increased with age. the population structure of e. faecium and e. faecalis was determined by superimposing goeburst and bayesian analysis of the population structure (baps). most e. faecium sequence types (sts; 150 isolates belonging to 75 sts) were linked to baps groups 1 (22.0%), 2 (31.3%), and 3 (36.7%). a positive association between hospital isolates and baps subgroups 2.1a and 3.3a (which included major ampicillin-resistant e. faecium human lineages) and between community-based ampicillin-resistant e. faecium isolates and baps subgroups 1.2 and 3.3b was found. most e. faecalis isolates (130 isolates belonging to 58 sts) were grouped into 3 baps groups, baps groups 1 (36.9%), 2 (40.0%), and 3 (23.1%), with each one comprising widespread lineages. no positive associations with age or hospitalization were established. the diversity and dynamics of enterococcal populations in the fecal microbiota of healthy humans are largely unexplored, with the available knowledge being fragmented and contradictory. the study offers a novel and comprehensive analysis of enterococcal population landscapes and suggests that e. faecium populations from  hospitalized patients and from community-based individuals differ, with a predominance of certain clonal lineages, often in association with elderly individuals, occurring in the hospital setting.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from the river and coastal waters in northern iran.
AB  == as fecal streptococci commonly inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and warm blooded animals, and daily detection of all pathogenic bacteria in coastal water  is not practical, thus these bacteria are used to detect the fecal contamination  of water. the present study examined the presence and the antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococcus spp. isolated from the babolrud river in babol and coastal waters in babolsar. seventy samples of water were collected in various regions of the babolrud and coastal waters. isolated bacteria were identified to  the species level using standard biochemical tests and pcr technique. in total, 70 enterococcus spp. were isolated from the babolrud river and coastal waters of  babolsar. enterococcus faecalis (68.6%) and enterococcus faecium (20%) were the most prevalent species. resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and tetracyclin was prevalent. the presence of resistant enterococcus spp. in coastal waters may transmit resistant genes to other bacteria; therefore, swimming in such environments is not suitable.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

AB  == elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant eriskirch, baden-wuerttemberg/germany. to determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of  17 month. for enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. in comparison to the established flocculation filtration at eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. however, antibiotic resistant e. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) were detected. the decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of  species: enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other enterococcus-species. overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration  led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.

TI  == identification of non-listeria spp. bacterial isolates yielding a beta-d-glucosidase-positive phenotype on agar listeria according to ottaviani and agosti (aloa).
AB  == agar listeria according to ottaviani and agosti (aloa) is the mandatory medium used for the detection and enumeration of listeria monocytogenes in foods according to the official international organization for standardization (iso) methods. on aloa, listeria spp. appear as bluish-green colonies due to the production of beta-d-glucosidase, an enzyme that cleaves 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, a chromogenic substrate included in the formulation of the medium. the present work reports on bacterial  isolates (n=64) from ready-to-eat soft cheeses, which are able to grow on aloa, forming bluish-green colonies and therefore phenotypically resemble listeria spp. all isolates were also capable of growing on the selective media palcam and rapid l'mono. the isolates were characterised with biochemical tests including those specified in the iso standards for the confirmation of listeria spp. and identified via partial sequencing of their 16s rrna gene. according to sequencing results the isolates represented 12 different bacterial species or species-groups belonging to seven different genera: bacillus spp. (b. circulans, b. clausii, b.  licheniformis and b. oleronius), cellulosimicrobium spp. (c. funkei), enterococcus spp. (e. faecalis, e. faecium/durans), kocuria spp. (k. kristinae),  marinilactibacillus spp. (m. psychrotolerans), rothia spp. (r. terrae) and staphylococcus spp. (s. sciuri and s. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus/xylosus). cellulosimicrobium spp. have never been previously isolated from foods. these results significantly extend the list of bacteria previously known as capable of growing on aloa as bluish-green colonies and suggest that there may be room for further improvement in the medium's inhibitory properties towards non-listeria spp., gram-positive bacteria present in foods.

AB  == as a first step for assessing the risk to human health posed by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the aquatic environment, we screened sewage and urban river water samples from miyazaki, japan for vre. because vancomycin-resistant organisms are not as prevalent in sewage and river water as  vancomycin-susceptible organisms, the samples were screened by minimum inhibitory concentration test using the vancomycin-supplemented membrane-enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside (mei) agar. the isolates, presumed to be enterococci, were identified using 16s rrna sequencing analysis. the percentages of vre isolates screened using 4 mug ml(-1) vancomycin-supplemented mei agar from sewage and urban river water samples were 12% and 24%, respectively. the vancomycin-resistant genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the isolates from both samples by pcr analysis. all enterococci isolates containing vanc1, which is a specific gene for vanc-type of vre, were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum. further, 92% enterococci isolates containing vanc2/3 were identified as e. casseliflavus/gallinarum, the remaining isolates containing vanc2/3 were e. faecium (4%) and e. faecalis (4%). thereafter, the distribution of e. faecium and e. faecalis, which are the major types of enterococci in humans containing vanc2/3, was observed in the water samples collected.

AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == mechanisms of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci isolated from two teaching hospitals in shanghai, china.
AB  == background: linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against gram-positive pathogens. however, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. the purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in shanghai, china. results: thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 staphylococcus capitis, three staphylococcus aureus, 14 enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid mics of 8 to 512 mug/ml, 8-32 mug/ml, 4-8 mug/ml and 4 mug/ml, respectively. all  linezolid-resistant s. capitis isolates had a novel c2131t mutation and a g2603t  mutation in the 23s rrna region, and some had a c316t (arg106cys) substitution in protein l4 and/or harboured cfr. linezolid-resistant s. aureus isolates carried a c389g (ala130gly) substitution in protein l3, and/or harboured cfr. the cfr gene  was flanked by two copies of the is256-like element, with a downstream orf1 gene. linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms.  the semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that 14 linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible e. faecalis strains. transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible  strains. conclusion: our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23s rrna and ribosomal proteins l3 and l4, along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should  also be taken into account.

TI  == molecular characterization and antibiotic resistance of enterococcus species from gut microbiota of chilean altiplano camelids.
AB  == background: enterococcus is one of the major human pathogens able to acquire multiple antibiotic-resistant markers as well as virulence factors which also colonize remote ecosystems, including wild animals. in this work, we characterized the enterococcus population colonizing the gut of chilean altiplano camelids without foreign human contact. material and methods: rectal swabs from 40 llamas and 10 alpacas were seeded in m-enterococcus agar, and we selected a total of 57 isolates. species identification was performed by biochemical classical tests, semi-automated wider system, mass spectrometry analysis by maldi-tof (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer), and, finally, nucleotide sequence of internal fragments of the 16s rrna, rpob, phes, and aac(6)-i genes. genetic diversity was measured by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge)-smai, whereas the antibiotic susceptibility was  determined by the wider system. carriage of virulence factors was explored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: our results demonstrated that the most  prevalent specie was enterococcus hirae (82%), followed by other non-enterococcus faecalis and non-enterococcus faecium species. some discrepancies were detected among the identification methods used, and the most reliable were the rpob, phes, and aac(6)-i nucleotide sequencing. selected isolates exhibited susceptibility to almost all studied antibiotics, and virulence factors were not detected by pcr. finally, some predominant clones were characterized by pfge into a diverse genetic background. conclusion: enterococcus species from the chilean camelids' gut microbiota were different from those adapted to humans, and they remained free of antibiotic resistance mechanisms as well as virulence factors.

TI  == australian enterococcal sepsis outcome progamme, 2011.
AB  == from 1 january to 31 december 2011, 29 institutions around australia participated in the australian enterococcal sepsis outcome programme (aesop). the aim of aesop 2011 was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteraemia isolates in australia that are antimicrobial resistant, with particular emphasis on susceptibility to ampicillin and the glycopeptides, and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of the enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates. of the 1,079 unique episodes of bacteraemia investigated, 95.8% were caused by either e. faecalis (61.0%) or e. faecium (34.8%). ampicillin resistance was detected in 90.4% of e. faecium but not detected in e. faecalis. using clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoints (clsi), vancomycin non-susceptibility was reported in 0.6% and 31.4% of e. faecalis and e. faecium respectively and was predominately due to the acquisition of the vanb operon. approximately 1 in 6 vanb e. faecium isolates however, had an minimum inhibitory  concentration at or below the clsi vancomycin susceptible breakpoint of </= 4 mg/l. overall, 37% of e. faecium harboured vana or vanb genes. although molecular typing identified 126 e. faecalis pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) pulsotypes, more than 50% belonged to 2 pulsotypes that were isolated across australia. e. faecium consisted of 73 pfge pulsotypes from which 43 multilocus sequence types were identified. almost 90% of the e. faecium were identified as clonal complex 17 clones, of which approximately half were characterised as sequence type 203, which was isolated australia-wide. in conclusion, the aesop 2011 has shown that although polyclonal, enterococcal bacteraemias in australia are frequently caused by ampicillin-resistant vanb e. faecium.

AB  == infections by opportunistic bacteria have significant contributions to morbidity  and mortality of hospitalized patients and also lead to high expenses in healthcare. in this setting, one of the major clinical problems is caused by gram-positive bacteria such as enterococci and staphylococci. in this study we extract, purify, identify and characterize immunogenic surface-exposed proteins present in the vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) strain enterococcus faecium e155 using three different extraction methods: trypsin shaving, biotinylation and elution at high ph. proteomic profiling was carried out by gel-free and gel-nanolc-ms/ms analyses. the total proteins found with each method were 390 by  the trypsin shaving, 329 by the elution at high ph, and 45 using biotinylation. an exclusively extracytoplasmic localization was predicted in 39 (10%) by trypsin shaving, in 47 (15%) by elution at high ph, and 27 (63%) by biotinylation. comparison between the three extraction methods by venn diagram and subcellular localization predictors (cello v.2.5 and gpos-mploc) allowed us to identify six proteins that are most likely surface-exposed: the scp-like extracellular protein, a low affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5), a basic membrane lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan-binding protein lysm (lysm), a d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase (ddcp) and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (ppic). due to their close relationship with the peptidoglycan, we chose pbp5, lysm, ddcp and ppic to test their potential as vaccine candidates. these putative surface-exposed proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified. rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified proteins were able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediated killing of the homologous strain e. faecium e155 as well as clinical strains e. faecium e1162, enterococcus faecalis 12030, type 2 and type 5. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies raised against these proteins reduced significantly the colony counts of e. faecium e155 in mice, indicating the effectiveness of these surface-related proteins as promising vaccine candidates to target different enterococcal pathogens.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == synthetic teichoic acid conjugate vaccine against nosocomial gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (lta) are amphiphilic polymers that are important constituents of the cell wall of many gram-positive bacteria. the chemical structures of lta vary among organisms, albeit in the majority of gram-positive bacteria the ltas feature a common poly-1,3-(glycerolphosphate) backbone. previously, the specificity of opsonic antibodies for this backbone present in some gram-positive bacteria has been demonstrated, suggesting that this minimal structure may be sufficient for vaccine development. in the present work, we studied a well-defined synthetic lta-fragment, which is able to inhibit opsonic killing of  polyclonal rabbit sera raised against native lta from enterococcus faecalis 12030. this promising compound was conjugated with bsa and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. subsequently, the opsonic activity of this serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay and specificity was confirmed by an opsonophagocytic inhibition assay. the conjugated lta-fragment was able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediate killing of the clinical strains e. faecalis 12030, enterococcus faecium e1162, and community-acquired staphylococcus aureus strain mw2 (usa400). prophylactic immunization with the teichoic acid conjugate and with the rabbit serum raised against this compound was evaluated in active and passive immunization studies in mice, and in an enterococcal endocarditis rat model. in all animal models, a statistically significant reduction of colony counts was observed indicating that the novel synthetic lta-fragment conjugate is a promising vaccine candidate for active or passive immunotherapy against e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == distribution of human-specific bacteroidales and fecal indicator bacteria in an urban watershed impacted by sewage pollution, determined using rna- and dna-based quantitative pcr assays.
AB  == the identification of fecal pollution sources is commonly carried out using dna-based methods. however, there is evidence that dna can be associated with dead cells or present as "naked dna" in the environment. furthermore, it has been shown that rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) assays  can be more sensitive than rrna gene-based qpcr assays since metabolically active cells usually contain higher numbers of ribosomes than quiescent cells. to this end, we compared the detection frequency of host-specific markers and fecal bacteria using rna-based rt-qpcr and dna-based qpcr methods for water samples collected in sites impacted by combined sewer overflows. as a group, fecal bacteria were more frequently detected in most sites using rna-based methods. specifically, 8, 87, and 85% of the samples positive for general enterococci, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium markers, respectively, were detected using rt-qpcr, but not with the qpcr assay counterpart. on average, two  human-specific bacteroidales markers were not detected when using dna in 12% of the samples, while they were positive for all samples when using rna (cdna) as the template. moreover, signal intensity was up to three orders of magnitude higher in rt-qpcr assays than in qpcr assays. the human-specific bacteroidales markers exhibited moderate correlation with conventional fecal indicators using rt-qpcr results, suggesting the persistence of nonhuman sources of fecal pollution or the presence of false-positive signals. in general, the results from this study suggest that rna-based assays can increase the detection sensitivity of fecal bacteria in urban watersheds impacted with human fecal sources.

TI  == assessing outcomes of adult oncology patients treated with linezolid versus daptomycin for bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
AB  == background: the incidence and severity of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus blood stream infections continue to rise and is a significant burden in the healthcare  setting. literature thus far is minimal regarding treatment outcomes in patients  with malignancy and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia. appropriate antibiotic selection is vital to treatment success due to high rates of resistance, limited antimicrobials and mortality in this patient population. we conducted this study to determine whether treatment outcomes differed between cancer patients treated with linezolid and those treated with daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia. methods: this single-center, retrospective study included adult patients hospitalized on the oncology service  with documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis bacteremia who received at least 48 h of either linezolid or daptomycin  as primary treatment. results: a total of 65 patients were included in the analysis. thirty-two patients received daptomycin as primary treatment, and 33 patients received linezolid as primary treatment. twenty-six (76.5%) patients in  the linezolid cohort versus 22 (71%) patients in the daptomycin cohort achieved microbiological cure (p = 0.6141). median length of stay in days (30 vs. 42, p =  0.0714) and mortality (7/32 (20.6%) vs. 8/33 (25.8%), p = 0.6180) were also similar between the linezolid and daptomycin treated patients, respectively. conclusion: no differences in microbiological cure, length of stay or mortality were identified between the groups. this study suggests that linezolid and daptomycin are each reasonable options for treating vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia in oncology patients. further prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the optimal treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia in this patient population.

TI  == the first report of the vanc(1) gene in enterococcus faecium isolated from a human clinical specimen.
AB  == the vanc(1) gene, which is chromosomally located, confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for enterococcus gallinarum. enterococcus faecium tj4031 was isolated from a blood culture and harbours the vanc(1)gene. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were performed to detect vanxyc and vantc genes. only the vanxyc gene was found in the e. faecium tj4031 isolate. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 2 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. real-time reverse transcription-pcr results revealed that the vanc(1) and vanxyc genes were not expressed. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridisation results showed that the vanc(1) gene was encoded in the chromosome. e. faecalis isolated from animals has been reported to harbour vanc(1)gene. however, this study is the first to report the presence of the vanc(1)gene in e. faecium of human origin. additionally, our research showed the vanc(1)gene cannot serve as a species-specific gene of e. gallinarum and that it is able to be transferred between bacteria. although the resistance marker is not expressed in the strain,  our results showed that e. faecium could acquire the vanc(1)gene from different species.

TI  == optimizing therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia in children.
AB  == purpose of review: uncertainties exist regarding the optimal treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (vre) bloodstream infections, particularly in settings in which ampicillin cannot be used. recent findings: quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, all approved between 1999 and 2003, represent the mainstays of therapy for vre bacteremia, although only linezolid has been specifically approved by the united states food and drug administration for this indication. the main objective of this review is to compare the relative efficacies, dosing strategies, and side-effect profiles of quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin for vre bacteremia in the pediatric population. a brief description of recently approved broad-spectrum gram-positive agents that may have a role in the management of vre bacteremia in  upcoming years is also provided. summary: linezolid, despite its bacteriostatic activity against vre, may be the most versatile of the available drugs. it has activity against both enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, can be administered orally, and resistance appears to be less of a concern with linezolid compared with the other agents. additionally, the results of two recent meta-analyses demonstrate more favorable outcomes with linezolid compared with daptomycin for the treatment of vre bacteremia. the clinical pharmacokinetics of linezolid have  been well described in children. the most notable concern with linezolid, however, is toxicities associated with prolonged use. until more prospective data are available, we favor linezolid as first-line therapy for the treatment of vre  bacteremia in children.

TI  == ceftobiprole and ampicillin increase daptomycin susceptibility of daptomycin-susceptible and -resistant vre.
AB  == objectives: the synergistic combination of daptomycin plus ampicillin has proven  to be effective against vre including daptomycin-non-susceptible strains. ceftobiprole is a cephalosporin with broad binding affinity for enterococcal pbp  subtypes including pbp5. given the synergy between beta-lactams and daptomycin against vre, it was of interest to determine whether ceftobiprole offered any synergistic advantage with daptomycin compared with ampicillin. methods: mics were determined by broth microdilution in the presence and absence of ampicillin  or ceftobiprole for 20 ampicillin-resistant vre. six strains, including two isogenic pairs of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and two vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, were evaluated for synergy using time-kill methods. synergy was defined as a >/=2 log10 cfu/ml reduction of the combination over the most active single agent. binding of daptomycin-bodipy in the presence and absence of ceftobiprole was quantified. results: daptomycin mics ranged from 2 to 256 mg/l. the addition of ceftobiprole and ampicillin reduced daptomycin mics by a median of 3 and 4 log2 dilutions, respectively. in time-kill studies, daptomycin plus either ceftobiprole or ampicillin was synergistic against four of six strains, but not the same strains. both combinations were synergistic against the vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis strains. ceftobiprole exposure increased daptomycin-bodipy binding by 2.8 times (p<0.0001). conclusions: ceftobiprole appears to offer a similar degree of synergistic activity to ampicillin when combined with daptomycin against vre. further research should explore the genetic and phenotypic qualities of strains that respond preferentially to ceftobiprole as opposed to ampicillin.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of novel peptide bf2 as an antibacterial agent against clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are the leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and acquired resistance to a variety of antibiotics. antimicrobial peptides represent a promising molecule against the antibiotic resistance in bacteria and an indispensable component of the innate immune system. the aim of the study was to  develop an antimicrobial peptide against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre).  we have designed a series of peptides based on sapecin b as template. an in vitro antibacterial study of synthetic peptide bf2 against the clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant and control strains of enterococci showed rapid killing effect on enterococci by killing 99.9% of bacterial cells in 60 min and susceptibility at minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 6.25-12.5 mug/ml. synergy of bf2 was observed in combination with vancomycin and teicoplanin. the peptide was bactericidal and nontoxic to mammalian cells. an in  vivo study also revealed the antibacterial activity against enterococci-infected  wistar albino rats. bf2 may be used synergistically with antibiotics.

TI  == enterococcus--virulence and susceptibility to photodynamic therapy of clinical isolates from lower silesia, poland.
AB  == background: a collection of 400 enterococcal isolates from clinical samples of hospitalized patients were studied for their virulence traits according to the isolation site. formation of biofilm and production of dnase, hemolysin, lipase,  and gelatinase were characterized. biofilms of selected strains were examined for their susceptibility to antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt). methods: all strains were tested for biofilm production by microtiter method and the activity  of hemolysin, gelatinase, lipase, and dnase by plate method with an adequate substrate. photodynamic therapy with photolon and red laser light was performed towards 48 h biofilms of eight representative strains. the viability of biofilms  was tested by the bactlight assay and visualized under a fluorescent microscope.  results: among the 400 isolates, 69.8% strains of enterococcus faecalis, 30% of enterococcus faecium, and 0.2% of enterococcus casseliflavus were identified. in  vitro, production of biofilm was found in 65.7% of enterococci. biofilm-positive  strains were isolated from urinary tract infections (81%), wound infections (71%), respiratory tract infections (62%), and gastrointestinal tract (47%) (colonization). hemolysin activity was observed in 28.5%, gelatinase in 24.5%, lipase in 23%, and dnase in 3.5% of all, mostly biofilm-positive, isolates. photodynamic therapy with photolon efficiently reduced the enterococcal biofilms. conclusions: the study demonstrated the high prevalence of biofilm-producing clinical enterococci, their virulence potential being higher than for biofilm-negative strains, and the susceptibility to apdt of mature biofilms produced by strains, regardless of their species and site of isolation.

AB  == background: rates of invasive vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in the usa  remains on the rise. efforts to control vancomycin use and nosocomial transmission have had limited success in halting the spread of this pathogen. the role of antibiotic exposure remains a topic of controversy. we evaluated the association between emergence of vre-blood-stream infections (bsi), aggregate and individual-patient vancomycin- exposure, and clonal transmission of vre at an academic pediatric tertiary care hospital. methods: e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates recovered from blood specimens from hospitalized children from 2003-2010 were retrieved from the microbiology database. aggregate vancomycin use and individual-patient vancomycin exposure 6 months preceding each event of bacteremia were recorded. pulse-field electrophoresis was performed on selected vre isolates. results: of 151 episodes of e. faecium and e. faecalis bsi among hospitalized children <18 years of age, 9% (14) were due to vre. of these, 5 (36%) were due to nosocomial transmission. aggregate (r .19, p = 0.3) and individual-patient vancomycin-exposure (x (2) = .26; p = .87) were not associated with vre-bsi. on bivariate analysis, or for developing vre-bsi among patients infected with clonal isolates was 36 (p < .0001). infection control interventions, rather than antimicrobial stewardship interventions to decrease vancomycin use, proved to be effective in reducing the rates of vre-bsi. conclusions: in our experience, vre-bsi was associated with nosocomial transmission and was independent of aggregate and individual-patient vancomycin-exposure. molecular epidemiology is a crucial tool to differentiate the role of nosocomial transmission and antibiotic exposure in the emergence of invasive vre infections among hospitalized children.

TI  == structure of the double-stranded dna-binding type iv secretion protein tran from  enterococcus.
AB  == conjugative transfer through type iv secretion multiprotein complexes is the most important means of spreading antimicrobial resistance. plasmid pip501, frequently found in clinical enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates, is the first gram-positive (g+) conjugative plasmid for which self-transfer to gram-negative (g-) bacteria has been demonstrated. the pip501-encoded type iv secretion system (t4ss) protein tran localizes to the cytoplasm and shows specific dna binding. the specific dna-binding site upstream of the pip501 origin of transfer (orit) was identified by a novel footprinting technique based on exonuclease digestion and sequencing, suggesting tran to be an accessory protein  of the pip501 relaxase traa. the structure of tran was determined to 1.35 a resolution. it revealed an internal dimer fold with antiparallel beta-sheets in the centre and a helix-turn-helix (hth) motif at both ends. surprisingly, structurally related proteins (excisionases from t4sss of g+ conjugative transposons and transcriptional regulators of the merr family) resembling only one half of tran were found. thus, tran may be involved in the early steps of pip501 transfer, possibly triggering pip501 traa relaxase activity by recruiting  the relaxosome to the assembled mating pore.

AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

AB  == enterococcus spp. are among the common pathogens causing infective endocarditis (ie). despite major medical advances and new potent antimicrobial agents, the mortality has not significantly improved for several decades. the usual lack of bactericidal activity of penicillin or ampicillin, the toxicity from the combination of penicillin plus aminoglycosides, and the increased reports of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides have led to the exploration of other regimens for treatment of enterococcus faecalis ie. as an example, ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is now a well-recognized regimen for this organism. however, the emerging of new drug resistances in enterococcus faecium dramatically reduces the therapeutic alternatives for this organism in ie which continues to be an immense challenge for clinicians even with the availability of newer antimicrobial agents. this article summarizes the current treatment options for enterococcal endocarditis and reviews of recent publications on the topic.

TI  == structures of new phenolics isolated from licorice, and the effectiveness of licorice phenolics on vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == licorice, which is the underground part of glycyrrhiza species, has been used widely in asian and western countries as a traditional medicine and as a food additive. our continuous investigation on the constituents of roots and stolons of glycyrrhiza uralensis led to the isolation of two new phenolics, in addition to 14 known compounds. structural studies including spectroscopic and simple chemical derivatizations revealed that both of the new compounds had 2-aryl-3-methylbenzofuran structures. an examination of the effectiveness of licorice phenolics obtained in this study on vancomycin-resistant strains enterococcus faecium fn-1 and enterococcus faecalis nctc12201 revealed that licoricidin showed the most potent antibacterial effects against both of e. faecalis and e. faecium with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 1.9 x 10-5 m. 8-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-wighteone, isoangustone a, 3'-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-kievitone, glyasperin c, and one of the new 3-methyl-2-phenylbenzofuran named neoglycybenzofuran also showed potent anti-vancomycin-resistant enterococci effects (mic 1.9 x 10-5-4.5 x 10-5 m for e. faecium and e. faecalis). the hplc condition for simultaneous detection of the phenolics in the extract was investigated to assess the quality control of the natural antibacterial resource, and quantitative estimation of several major phenolics in the extract with the established hplc condition was also performed.  the results showed individual contents of 0.08%-0.57% w/w of etoac extract for the major phenolics in the materials examined.

TI  == wide distribution of virulence genes among enterococcus faecium and enterococcus  faecalis clinical isolates.
AB  == enterococcus, a gram-positive facultative anaerobic cocci belonging to the lactic acid bacteria of the phylum firmicutes, is known to be able to resist a wide range of hostile conditions such as different ph levels, high concentration of nacl (6.5%), and the extended temperatures between 5( degrees )c and 65( degrees  )c. despite being the third most common nosocomial pathogen, our understanding on its virulence factors is still poorly understood. the current study was aimed to  determine the prevalence of different virulence genes in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. for this purpose, 79 clinical isolates of malaysian enterococci were evaluated for the presence of virulence genes. pilb, fms8, efaafm, and sgra genes are prevalent in all clinical isolates. in conclusion, the pathogenicity of e. faecalis and e. faecium could be associated with different virulence factors and these genes are widely distributed among the enterococcal species.

TI  == experimental study of the impact of antimicrobial treatments on campylobacter, enterococcus and pcr-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles of the gut microbiota of chickens.
AB  == an experiment was conducted to compare the impact of antimicrobial treatments on  the susceptibility of campylobacter, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, and on the diversity of broiler microbiota. specific-pathogen-free chickens were first orally inoculated with strains of campylobacter and enterococcus faecium. birds were then orally treated with recommended doses of oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim, amoxicillin or enrofloxacin. faecal samples were collected before, during and after antimicrobial treatment. the susceptibility of campylobacter, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated on supplemented or non-supplemented media was studied and pcr-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) profiles of the gut microbiota were analysed. enrofloxacin-resistant campylobacter were selected in the enrofloxacin-treated group and showed the thr86ile mutation in the gyra gene. acquisition of the teto gene in campylobacter coli isolates was significantly more frequent in birds given oxytetracycline. no  impact of amoxicillin treatment on the susceptibility of campylobacter could be detected. ampicillin- and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim-resistant enterococcus faecium were selected in amoxicillin-treated broilers, but no selection of the inoculated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium could be detected, although  it was also resistant to tetracycline and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim. pcr-ce-sscp revealed significant variations in a few peaks in treated birds as compared with non-treated chickens. in conclusion, antimicrobial treatments perturbed chicken gut microbiota, and certain antimicrobial treatments selected or co-selected resistant strains of campylobacter and enterococcus.

TI  == the first report of the vanc1 gene in enterococcus faecium isolated from a human  clinical specimen.
AB  == the vanc1 gene, which is chromosomally located, confers resistance to vancomycin  and serves as a species marker for enterococcus gallinarum. enterococcus faecium  tj4031 was isolated from a blood culture and harbours the vanc1gene. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were performed to detect vanxyc and vantc genes. only the vanxyc gene was found in the e. faecium tj4031 isolate. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 2 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. real-time reverse transcription-pcr results revealed that the vanc1and vanxyc genes were not expressed. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridisation results showed that the vanc1 gene was encoded in the chromosome. e. faecalis isolated from animals has been reported to harbour vanc1gene. however, this study is the first to report the presence of the vanc1gene in e. faecium of human origin. additionally, our research showed the vanc1gene cannot serve as a species-specific gene of e. gallinarum and that it is able to be transferred between bacteria. although the resistance marker is not expressed in the strain, our results showed that e. faecium could acquire the vanc1gene from different species.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == role of efrab efflux pump in biocide tolerance and antibiotic resistance of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from traditional fermented foods and the effect of edta as efrab inhibitor.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from various traditional  fermented foods of both animal and vegetable origins have shown multidrug resistance to several antibiotics and tolerance to biocides. reduced susceptibility was intra and inter-species dependent and was due to specific and  unspecific mechanisms such as efflux pumps. efrab, a heterodimeric abc transporter efflux pump, was detected in 100% of multidrug resistant (mdr) e. faecalis strains and only in 12% of mdr e. faecium strains. efrab expression was  induced by half of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of gentamicin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol. however, expression of efra and efrb genes was  highly dependent on the strain tested and on the antimicrobial used. our results  indicated that 3 mm edta highly reduced the mics of almost all drugs tested. nevertheless, the higher reductions (>8 folds) were obtained with gentamicin, streptomycin, chlorhexidine and triclosan. reductions of mics were correlated with down-regulation of efrab expression (10-140 folds) in all three mdr enterococci strains. this is the first report describing the role of efrab in the efflux of antibiotics and biocides which reflect also the importance of efrab in  multidrug resistance in enterococci. edta used at low concentration as food preservative could be one of the best choices to prevent spread of multidrug resistant enterococci throughout food chain by decreasing efrab expression. efrab could be an attractive target not only in enterococci present in food matrix but  also those causing infections as well by using edta as therapeutic agent in combination with low doses of antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of medilox(r) super-oxidized water.
AB  == aim: super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. there are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. the aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of medilox(r) super-oxidized water that is approved by the food and drug administration (fda) as high level disinfectant. material and methods: in this study, super-oxidized water obtained from medilox(r) [soosan e & c, korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six atcc strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. dey-engley neutralizing broth [sigma-aldrich, usa] was used as neutralizing agent. results: medilox(r) was found to be effective against all standard strains (acinetobacter baumannii 19606, escherichia coli 25922, enterococcus faecalis 29212, klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical  isolates (acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. it was found to be effective on aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. conclusion: medilox(r) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.

TI  == revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on mic results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  == the reference broth microdilution (bmd) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the clsi recommendations for water-insoluble agents. polysorbate 80 (p-80) was also added  to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. four hundred sixty-two gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the mic results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and  several sensititre dry-form bmd panel formulations. the revised method provided mic results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in mic50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. less-significant mic decreases (1 to 2 log2  dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar mic50 values for both methods. however, streptococcus pneumoniae had mic50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. the revised bmd method provides lower mic results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. this is secondary to the use of dmso for panel production and the presence of p-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate  mic determination. moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance and siderophore production in enterococci].
AB  == introduction: enterococci belong to the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointensinal tract of humans. enterococci are regarded as harmless commensal, and are even believed to have probiotic characteristics. however, they can cause  variety of infections, including endocarditis, bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections. during the past several decades, enterococci, and particularly  enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, have been identified as an important cause  of nosocomial infections. enterococci are intrinsically resistant to a broad range of antimicrobials. infection caused by resistant strains are difficult to treat. iron is an essential element for bacteria, but is not easily available in  host organisms. enterococci are iron dependent bacteria. competition for iron between the host and bacteria is an important factor determining the course of bacterial infections. a common strategy among bacteria living in iron-limited environments is the secretion of siderophores, which can bind poorly soluble iron and make it available to cells via active transport mechanisms. the aim of the presented study was to evaluate the correlation between antibiotic resistance and siderophore production of bacteria of the genus enterococcus. methods: the study  included 55 bacterial strains from genus enterococcus belonging to two species--enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out using disc diffusion methods with guidelines of european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). total siderophore activity in the culture supernatants was measured using chrome azurol s. hydroxamate siderophores were assayed using a chemical-specific assay. results: antibacterial susceptibility pattern reveals that e. faecium is more resistant than e. faecalis. a significant correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolnes and siderophores production. ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-resistant enterococal strains produced siderophores in large quantity. conclusions: one of the most common infections caused by enterococci are urinary tract infections. fluoroquinolones are an important group of antimicrobial agents used in this type of infection. fluoroquinolones resistance  of enterococci associated with increased synthesis of siderophores result in the  increased virulence that may decide on the severity of the infection and the effectiveness of the treatment.

TI  == single consumption of bryndza cheese temporarily affects oral microbiota and salivary markers of oxidative stress.
AB  == several oral diseases are associated with changes in oral microbiota and higher oxidative stress. enterococcus faecalis has been hypothesized to directly contribute to the oxidative stress in oral cavity. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of single consumption of unpasteurized bryndza cheese containing enterococci on changes of microbiota and oxidative status in saliva. fourteen healthy volunteers aged 23-30 years were asked to eat 100 g of bryndza cheese. saliva samples were collected before and 1, 10, 100 min, and 24 h after bryndza cheese consumption. species-specific pcr and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis were used to characterize oral microbiota. markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status were measured in saliva. pcr identified e. faecium in 36 % of probands saliva up to 1 day after consumption of enterococci containing bryndza cheese. e. faecalis was detected in 57 % of probands saliva up to 10 min and in one proband up to 100 min after bryndza cheese consumption. t-rflp analysis confirmed short-term changes in composition of oral microbiota after bryndza cheese ingestion. nevertheless, the  microbiota was completely restored after 24 h. one minute after ingestion of bryndza cheese, salivary advanced oxidation protein products were significantly increased (by 74.6 %, p < 0.001), and total antioxidant capacity was decreased (by 22.0 %, p < 0.05). this study shows that single consumption of enterococci containing bryndza cheese can temporally affect the composition of oral microbiota and oxidative stress in saliva. further studies should identify the impact of these changes to the pathogenesis of oral diseases.

TI  == defining daptomycin resistance prevention exposures in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis.
AB  == daptomycin is used off-label for enterococcal infections; however, dosing targets for resistance prevention remain undefined. doses of 4 to 6 mg/kg of body weight/day approved for staphylococci are likely inadequate against enterococci due to reduced susceptibility. we modeled daptomycin regimens in vitro to determine the minimum exposure to prevent daptomycin resistance (dapr) in enterococci. daptomycin simulations of 4 to 12 mg/kg/day (maximum concentration of drug in serum [cmax] of 57.8, 93.9, 123.3, 141.1, and 183.7 mg/liter; half-life [t1/2] of 8 h) were tested against one enterococcus faecium strain (s447) and one enterococcus faecalis strain (s613) in a simulated endocardial vegetation pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model over 14 days. samples were plated on media containing 3x the mic of daptomycin to detect dapr. mutations in  genes encoding proteins associated with cell envelope homeostasis (yycfg and liafsr) and phospholipid metabolism (cardiolipin synthase [cls] and cyclopropane  fatty acid synthetase [cfa]) were investigated in dapr derivatives. dapr derivatives were assessed for changes in susceptibility, surface charge, membrane depolarization, cell wall thickness (cwt), and growth rate. strains s447 and s613 developed dapr after simulations of 4 to 8 mg/kg/day but not 10 to 12 mg/kg/day.  mics for dapr strains ranged from 8 to 256 mg/liter. some s613 derivatives developed mutations in liaf or cls. s447 derivatives lacked mutations in these genes. dapr derivatives from both strains exhibited lowered growth rates, up to a 72% reduction in daptomycin-induced depolarization and up to 6-nm increases in cwt (p<0.01). peak/mic and auc0-24/mic ratios (auc0-24 is the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h) associated with dapr prevention were 72.1 and 780 for s447 and 144 and 1561 for s613, respectively. daptomycin doses of 10 mg/kg/day may be required to prevent dapr in serious enterococcal infections.

AB  == in this work, genes encoding gelatinase (gele) and serine proteinase (spre), two  extracellular proteases produced by enterococcus faecalis dbh18, were cloned in the protein expression vector pmg36c, containing the constitutive p32 promoter, generating the recombinant plasmids pcg, pcsp, and pcgsp encoding gele, spre, and gele-spre, respectively. transformation of noncaseinolytic e. faecalis p36, e. faecalis jh2-2, e. faecium ar24, and e. hirae ar14 strains with these plasmids permitted detection of caseinolytic activity only in the strains transformed with pcg or pcgsp. complementation of a deletion (knockout) mutant of e. faecalis v583 for production of gelatinase (gele) with pcg unequivocally supported that gele is responsible for the caseinolytic activity of the transformed strain grown in bovine skim milk (bsm). rp-hplc-ms/ms analysis of hydrolysates of transformed enterococcus spp. strains grown in bsm permitted the identification of 38 major peptide fragments including peptides with previously reported angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity (ace-ia), antihypertensive activity, and antioxidant activity.

TI  == activity of daptomycin or linezolid in combination with rifampin or gentamicin against biofilm-forming enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model using simulated endocardial vegetations and an in vivo survival assay using galleria mellonella larvae.
AB  == enterococci are the third most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. a high-inoculum stationary-phase in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations was used to simulate the human pharmacokinetics of daptomycin at 6 or 10 mg/kg of body weight/day or linezolid at 600 mg every 12 h  (q12h), alone or in combination with gentamicin at 1.3 mg/kg q12h or rifampin at  300 mg q8h or 900 mg q24h. biofilm-forming, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus [vre]) strains were tested. at 24, 48, and 72 h, all daptomycin-containing regimens demonstrated significantly more activity (decline  in cfu/g) than any linezolid-containing regimen against biofilm-forming e. faecalis. the addition of gentamicin to daptomycin (at 6 or 10 mg/kg) in the first 24 h significantly improved bactericidal activity. in contrast, the addition of rifampin delayed the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against e. faecalis, and the addition of rifampin antagonized the activities of all regimens against vre at 24 h. also, against vre, the addition of gentamicin to linezolid at 72 h improved activity and was bactericidal. rifampin significantly antagonized the activity of linezolid against vre at 72 h. in in vivo galleria mellonella survival assays, linezolid and daptomycin improved survival. daptomycin at 10 mg/kg improved survival significantly over that with linezolid against e. faecalis. the addition of gentamicin improved the efficacy of daptomycin against e. faecalis and those of linezolid and daptomycin against vre. we conclude that in enterococcal infection models, daptomycin has more activity than linezolid alone. against biofilm-forming e. faecalis, the addition of gentamicin in the first 24 h causes the most rapid decline in cfu/g. of interest, the addition of rifampin decreased the activity of daptomycin against both e. faecalis and vre.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by enterococcus isolates: aetiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to analyse the data on resistance in enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolated from urine samples of inpatients from january 2010 to december 2013. compared to e. faecalis, e. faecium isolates were significantly more resistant to ampicilin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin in the antimicrobial agents evaluated. both species showed higher resistance to high-level gentamicin. the rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in e. faecium was higher as compared to that of e. faecalis, and we found that apparent increase in the frequency of vre e. faecalis clinical isolates in the 4-year study period. in our study, analysis of the antimicrobial resistance trends showed resistance to linezolid and vancomycin were <30.2% and <20.3% in both species, respectively. of noteworthy is the high rate of mdr in two species from  inpatients. this study highlights that it is of importance for clinicians to promote rational drug utilization and delay the emergence of resistant organisms.

TI  == prevalence and detection of mixed-population enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == mixed-population (heterogeneous) enterococcal bacteremia (meb) is rarely reported. based on one occasion in which vitek2 missed a vancomycin-resistant subpopulation isolated from a patient, we developed a simple method to detect this subpopulation and determined meb frequency. the four patients presented here had either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis bacteremia caused by both vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse). no prior common antibiotic therapy was observed, and bacteremia resolved with daptomycin, gentamicin, and/or linezolid treatment. in two cases, vre presence was missed by vitek2. to detect the vre subpopulation, tryptic soy broth was inoculated from positive blood cultures and a saline suspension was inoculated to a vancomycin (6-mug/ml) (v6) plate. two isolates from each patient were studied further. relatedness was assessed by multilocus sequence typing, fitness was evaluated by growth curve and competition assays, and vana presence was determined by pcr. meb represented approximately 5% of all  enterococcal bacteremias. all vre subpopulations grew on v6 plates but were missed in two instances by vitek2. vre and vse isolates from each patient were closely related and did not differ in overall fitness. all four vre isolates and  2/4 vse isolates were vana positive. mebs occur regardless of prior antimicrobial therapy, are relatively common in our hospital, and are important to detect. as far as we know, this study is the first to report heterogeneous e. faecalis bacteremia. there is a simple method to detect vre subpopulations that may be missed by vitek2.

TI  == incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for enterococcus spp. blood stream infections: a population-based study.
AB  == background: enterococci are a clinically significant cause of bloodstream infections (bsi), particularly in the nosocomial setting. the purpose of this study was to characterize the incidence, risk factors for acquisition, microbiological characteristics and mortality of enterococcal bsi within the well-defined population of a large canadian health region. methods: surveillance  for all episodes of enterococcal bsi occurring among residents of the calgary health zone (population 1.2 million) between 2000 and 2008 was conducted using an electronic surveillance system. clinical features, microbiology, and outcomes were obtained. results: a total of 710 incident episodes of enterococcal bsi were identified for an annual incidence of 6.9 episodes per 100,000; the incidences of e. faecalis and e. faecium bsi were 4.5, and 1.6 per 100,000, respectively. enterococcus faecalis infections were associated with a urinary focus, genitourinary malignancy, and abnormal genitourinary anatomy. e. faecium infections were associated with a gastrointestinal focus. resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was higher in e. faecium infection. the  overall case fatality rate was 22.8%, and was higher for e. faecium infection. conclusions: this is the second population-based study to assess the risk factors for enterococcal bsi and compare the characteristics of infection with e. faecalis and e. faecium. results suggest that bsi with e. faecalis and e. faecium should be regarded as two clinically different entities with unique sets of risk  factors and microbiologic characteristics.

TI  == surotomycin demonstrates low in vitro frequency of resistance and rapid bactericidal activity in clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == surotomycin (cb-183,315) is an orally administered, minimally absorbed, selective bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide in phase 3 development for the treatment of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. the aim of this study was to evaluate  the emergence of resistance in c. difficile (atcc 700057 and three recent clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis groups bi, bk, and k), vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis (atcc 49452), vancomycin-resistant (vr) e. faecalis (atcc 700802), vs enterococcus faecium (atcc 6569), and vr e. faecium (atcc 51559) under anaerobic conditions. the rate  of spontaneous resistance was below the limit of detection (<10(-8) to <10(-9)) for surotomycin at 16 and 32x the mic for all isolates tested. under selective pressure by serial passage, c. difficile grew in a maximum of 4 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics of 2 to 8 mug/ml [4- to 16-fold higher than those of the  naive control]) at day 15, with the exception of the c. difficile bk strain, which grew in 16 to 32 mug/ml (final mics of 8 to 32 mug/ml [16- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). enterococci remained relatively unchanged over 15 days, growing in a maximum of 8 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics  of 2 to 16 mug/ml [8- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). of the isolates tested, no cross-resistance to vancomycin, rifampin, ampicillin, metronidazole, or moxifloxacin was observed. surotomycin at 20x mic demonstrated  equally rapid bactericidal activity (>/= 3-log-unit reduction in cfu/ml in </= 8  h) against naive and reduced-susceptibility isolates of c. difficile, vs enterococcus (vse), and vr enterococcus (vre), except for c. difficile bk (2.6-log-unit reductions for both). these results suggest that emergence of resistance to surotomycin against c. difficile, e. faecalis, and e. faecium is likely to be rare.

TI  == impact of different antimicrobial therapies on clinical and fiscal outcomes of patients with bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are a growing health problem, and uncertainties exist regarding the optimal therapy for bloodstream infection due to vre. we conducted systematic comparative evaluations of the impact of different antimicrobial therapies on the outcomes of patients with bloodstream infections due to vre. a retrospective study from january 2008 to october 2010 was conducted at detroit medical center. unique patients with blood cultures due  to vre were included and reviewed. three major therapeutic classes were analyzed: daptomycin, linezolid, and beta-lactams. three multivariate models were conducted for each outcome, matching for a propensity score predicting the likelihood of receipt of one of the therapeutic classes. a total of 225 cases of bacteremia due to vre were included, including 86 (38.2%) cases of vr enterococcus faecalis and  139 (61.8%) of vr enterococcus faecium. bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis was more frequent among subjects treated with beta-lactams than among those treated with daptomycin or linezolid. the median dose of daptomycin was 6 mg/kg of body weight (range, 6 to 12 mg/kg). after controlling for propensity score and bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis, differences in mortality were nonsignificant among the treatment groups. therapy with daptomycin was associated with higher median variable direct cost per day than that for linezolid. this large study revealed the three therapeutic classes (daptomycin, linezolid, and beta-lactams) are similarly efficacious in the treatment of bacteremia due to susceptible strains of vre.

TI  == evaluation of the novel combination of daptomycin plus ceftriaxone against vancomycin-resistant enterococci in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulated endocardial vegetation model.
AB  == objectives: daptomycin has demonstrated synergy with beta-lactams against enterococcus faecium and this combination has been used successfully to treat infections refractory to daptomycin. we investigated daptomycin alone and combined with ceftriaxone against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulated endocardial vegetation (sev) model. methods: daptomycin (6 and 12 mg/kg/day) with and without 2 g of ceftriaxone every 24 h were evaluated against two clinical e. faecium strains (8019 and 5938) and one enterococcus faecalis (6981) in a 96 h in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic sev model. fitc-labelled poly-l-lysine was used to assess beta-lactam-induced changes in cell surface charge. results: for 8019 and 6981, daptomycin 6 mg/kg with ceftriaxone and daptomycin 12 mg/kg alone and in combination with ceftriaxone displayed significantly more activity than daptomycin 6 mg/kg alone from 48 to 96 h (p </= 0.005). the addition of ceftriaxone significantly enhanced activity of daptomycin 6 mg/kg against both strains at 96 h (8019, reductions -0.55 versus 3.64 log10 cfu/g; 6981, reductions 1.11 versus 5.67 log10 cfu/g; p < 0.001) and improved daptomycin 12 mg/kg against 8019 at 96 h. daptomycin 12 mg/kg plus ceftriaxone displayed no appreciable activity against 5938 (daptomycin mic 32 mg/l). daptomycin non-susceptibility developed in 8019 and 6981 versus daptomycin 6 mg/kg by 96 h. ampicillin or ceftriaxone exposure reduced daptomycin surface charge in 8019, resulting in significantly increased fitc-poly-l-lysine binding. conclusions: the combination  of daptomycin and ceftriaxone may be promising for eradicating high-inoculum, deep-seated enterococcal infections. further research is warranted to examine the enhancement of daptomycin and innate immunity killing of vre by ceftriaxone and other beta-lactams.

AB  == objectives: this study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs in tibet, china, and analyzed the influence of free-ranging husbandry on antimicrobial resistance. methods: a total of 232 fecal samples were collected from tibetan pigs, and the disk diffusion method was used to examine their antimicrobial resistance. broth microdilution and agar dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for antimicrobial agents for which disks were not commercially available. results: a total of 129 e. coli isolates and 84 enterococcus isolates  were recovered from the fecal samples. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 40.4% were resistant to tetracycline. a small number of isolates were resistant to florfenicol (27.9%), ampicillin (27.9%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19.4%), nalidixic acid (19.4%), streptomycin (16.2%) and ceftiofur (10.9%), and very low resistance rates to ciprofloxacin (7.8%), gentamicin (6.9%), and spectinomycin (2.3%) were observed in e. coli. all enterococcus isolates, including e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, and e. mundtii, were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and vancomycin, but showed high frequencies of resistance to oxacillin (92.8%), clindamycin (82.1%),  tetracycline (64.3%), and erythromycin (48.8%). resistance rates to florfenicol (17.9%), penicillin (6.0%), ciprofloxacin (3.6%), levofloxacin (1.2%), and ampicillin (1.2%) were low. only one high-level streptomycin resistant e. faecium isolate and one high-level gentamicin resistant e. faecium isolate were observed. approximately 20% and 70% of e. coli and enterococcus isolates, respectively, were defined as multidrug-resistant. conclusions: in this study, e. coli and enterococcus isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs showed relatively lower resistance rates than those in other areas of china, where more intensive farming practices are used. these results also revealed that free-range husbandry and absence of antibiotic use could decrease the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance to some extent.

AB  == enterococcus faecalis (n = 834) and enterococcus faecium (n = 135) from blood and feces of hospitalized humans, from feces of outpatients and livestock and from food were screened for their susceptibility to a quaternary ammonium compound (didecyldimethylammoniumchloride, ddac) and to 28 antibiotics by micro-/macrodilution. the maximum ddac-mic in our field study was 3.5 mg/l, but after adaptation in the laboratory, mic values of 21.9 mg/l were observed. strains for which ddac had mics > 1.4 mg/l ("non-wildtype," in total: 46 of 969 isolates/4.7%) were most often found in milk and dairy products (14.6%), while their prevalence in livestock was generally low (0-4%). of human isolates, 2.9-6.8% had a "non-wildtype" phenotype. an association between reduced susceptibility to ddac, high-level-aminoglycoside resistance and aminopenicillin  resistance was seen in e. faecium (p < 0.05). no indications for a common source  of non-wildtype strains were found by rapd-pcr; however, several non-wildtype e.  faecalis shared the same variant of the emea-gene. in addition, bacteria (n = 42) of different genera were isolated from formic acid based boot bath disinfectant (20 ml of 55% formic acid/l). the mics of this disinfectant exceeded the wildtype mics up to 20-fold (staphylococci), but were still one to three orders of magnitude below the used concentration of the disinfectant (i. e., 1.1% formic acid). in conclusion, the bacterial susceptibility to disinfectants still seems to be high. thus, the proper use of disinfectants in livestock surroundings along with a good hygiene praxis should still be highly encouraged. hints to a link between antibiotic resistance and reduced susceptibility for disinfectants-as seen for e. faecium-should be substantiated in further studies and might be an additional reason to confine the use of antibiotics.

TI  == high level aminoglycoside resistance and distribution of aminoglycoside resistant genes among clinical isolates of enterococcus species in chennai, india.
AB  == enterococci are nosocomial pathogen with multiple-drug resistance by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. aminoglycosides along with cell wall inhibitors are given clinically for treating enterococcal infections. 178 enterococcal isolates  were analyzed in this study. e. faecalis is identified to be the predominant enterococcus species, along with e. faecium, e. avium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. dispar and e. gallinarum. high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) by mic for  gentamicin (gm), streptomycin (sm) and both (gm + sm) antibiotics was found to be 42.7%, 29.8%, and 21.9%, respectively. detection of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme encoding genes (ame) in enterococci was identified by multiplex pcr for aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia; aph(2'')-ib; aph(2'')-ic; aph(2'')-id and aph(3')-iiia genes. 38.2% isolates carried aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene and 40.4% isolates carried aph(3')-iiia gene. aph(2'')-ib; aph(2'')-ic; aph(2'')-id were not detected among our study isolates. aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and aph(3')-iiia genes  were also observed in hlar e. durans, e. avium, e. hirae, and e. gallinarum isolates. this indicates that high level aminoglycoside resistance genes are widely disseminated among isolates of enterococci from chennai.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species: a hospital-based study in china.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species isolated from a university hospital, and explore the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance, so as to provide clinical evidence for the inappropriate clinical use of antimicrobial agents and the control and prevention of enterococcal infections. methods: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from january 2010 to december 2012 in the general hospital of ningxia medical university were identified to species level with a vitek-2 compact fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species was determined using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. the multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of enterococcus species from the burns department. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the mic of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment  were evaluated. the beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emea genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: the 1,157 clinical isolates of enterococcus species included 679 e. faecium isolates  (58.7%), 382 e. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 e. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24  e. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other enterococcus species (4%). the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between e. faecium and e. faecalis, and </= 1.1% of these two enterococcus species were found to be  resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. in addition, the enterococcus  species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. the beta-lactamase gene tem, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes  aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iii, ant(6)-i and ant(2")-i, tetracycline resistance gene tetm, erythromycin resistance gene ermb, vancomycin resistance gene vana and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. conclusions: similar to previous findings, e. faecium and  e. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent  in the hospital isolates of enterococcus species. reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the mic of enterococcus species to these three  fluoroquinolones. the presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in enterococcus species. the monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections.

TI  == systematic evaluation of commercial susceptibility testing methods for determining the in vitro activity of daptomycin versus staphylococcus aureus and  enterococci.
AB  == we systematically evaluated 5 methods for testing daptomycin versus 48 enterococcus faecalis, 51 enterococcus faecium, and 50 staphylococcus aureus isolates using (i and ii) broth microdilution (bmd) with 50-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (reference method) and 30-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (bmd30 method), (iii) etest, and (iv and v) microscan panel 33 using 2 methods to prepare the bacterial inoculum (microscan turbidity and microscan prompt). isolates were categorized as susceptible (s) or nonsusceptible (ns) based on measured mics. essential (+/- 1 dilution) agreement (ea) and categorical (s/ns) agreement (ca) for each method were compared to the reference  method. for e. faecium, categorical agreement was poor between the reference method and bmd30 as well as with the three commercial methods, with frequent false-ns results (30 for bmd30, 18 for etest, 22 for microscan prompt, and 25 for microscan turbidity). all e. faecalis isolates were judged to be s by the reference method; two of these isolates were categorized as ns using the bmd30 method, and one was categorized as ns by all three commercial methods. all s. aureus isolates were judged to be s using all five methods. mic values determined by the comparator methods tended to be higher than those for the reference method, especially for e. faecium isolates. eas between the reference bmd and bmd30, etest, microscan prompt, and microscan turbidity were 63%, 63%, 63%, and 56%, respectively, for e. faecium, 87%, 83%, 98%, and 80%, respectively, for e. faecalis, and all 100% for s. aureus.

TI  == enterococcal bacteriocins and antimicrobial proteins that contribute to niche control
AB  == enterococci, which belong to the group of lactic acid bacteria (lab), have received increased attention in recent years for various reasons (fisher & phillips, 2009; franz, huch, abriouel, holzapfel, & galvez, 2011; leavis, bonten, & willems, 2006). while lactobacilli, another group of lab, have been shown to confer numerous benefits and are often regarded as health-bringing organisms, enterococci have become more recognized as emerging human pathogens despite the fact that they are as numerous as the lactobacilli in our gastrointestinal tractgastrointestinal tract. enterococcus faecalis is the dominant enterocuccus in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by e. faecium; however, e. avium and e. hirae, as well as other enterococcal species, are frequently found in human stool samples. the commensal/probiotic role of enterococci in humans and animals has evolved through thousands of years in mutual coexistence-but the ability of the enterococci to behave in a way that causes problems to human health is only beginning to be understood. virulence, which may evolved as an adaptation to the  "modern lifestyle," including the profligate use of antibiotics in medical practice and animal husbandry, needs to be understood and limited where possible. on the other side, enterococci have many positive traits that have been appreciated in food fermentation and preservation, and may also serve as probiotics to promote health. bacteriocin-producing bacteria are found in all environments. in many lab isolates, bacteriocin production has been examined by biochemical and genetic studies, and the bacteriocins produced by enterococci are often similar to those produced by other lactic acid bacteria. a classification scheme has been developed for bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria, and most of this information is based on findings from lab. although classification is still a disputed issue, two major classes of heat-stable, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides are well defined. class i constitutes the lantibiotics, while class ii constitutes the unmodified non-lantibiotics. bacteriocins within different classes and subclasses also have  been isolated and characterized in enterococci (cotter, hill, & ross, 2005; nes,  diep, havarstein, brurberg, eijsink, & holo, 1996; nes, yoon, & diep, 2007). one  of the most striking findings so far is the almost complete absence of lantibiotics among enteroccci, with the only exceptions being cytolysin and enterocin w (coburn & gilmore, 2003; cox, coburn, & gilmore, 2005; sawa, et al.,  2012). most of the characterized enterocins belong to the class ii bacteriocins and a few are heat-labile lytic enzymes. the latter were previously classified as bacteriocins, but are now included in a distinct class of antimicrobials (cotter, hill, & ross, 2005). the hemolytic bacteriocin (cytolysin), the circular as-48, and bacteriocin 21 have been known as e. faecalis bacteriocins for a long time, and they have been genetically and biochemically well characterized (clewell d. b., 1981; gilmore, 1991; gilmore, coburn, nallapareddy, & murray, 2002; gilmore,  segarra, booth, bogie, hall, & clewell, 1994; haas, shepard, & gilmore, 2002; ike, clewell, segarra, & gilmore, 1990). many bacteriocin producers have been identified and investigated from infection-derived e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates. from e. faecalis isolates, for example, bacteriocin 31 (tomita, fujimoto, tanimoto, & ike, 1996) and bacteriocin 41 (tomita, kamei, & ike, 2008)  have been studied; and from e. faecium, there are bacteriocin 43 (todokoro, tomita, inoue, & ike, 2006), bacteriocin 32 (nes, diep, havarstein, brurberg, eijsink, & holo, 1996), and bacteriocin 51 (yamashita, tomita, inoue, & ike, 2011). besides enterococcal bacteriocins of clinical origin, bacteriocins from enterococci of food origins have been studied, and several bacteriocins from e.faecium isolates have been identified and characterized. these include enterocin l50a/l50b (cintas l. m., casaus, holo, hernandez, nes, & havarstein, 1998), enterocin q (cintas l. m., et al., 2000; criado, et al., 2006), enterocin  a (aymerich, holo, havarstein, hugas, garriga, & nes, 1996; nilsen, nes, & holo,  1998), enterocin p (cintas l. m., casaus, havarstein, hernandez, & nes, 1997; kang & lee, 2005), enterocin b (casaus, nilsen, cintas, nes, hernandez, & holo, 1997) and others. many enterocins have also been characterized from various enterococcal species and from many environments, and the most thoroughly characterized enterocins are summarized in table 1. most of the characterized enterocins are from e. faecium and e. faecalis, but enterocins have also been isolated from e. muntii, e. avium, e. hirae, and e. durans (see table 1). the bacteriocin-producing enterococci are by and large isolated from food, waste, and the feces and gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but may also be isolated from other sources. fermented food, specimens from human infections, and feces from healthy babies seem to be particularly good niches for isolating bacteriocin-producing enterococci (see figure 1). it seems likely that most enterococci originate from the digestive tract of humans and animals, a notion which is in line with the finding that the same bacteriocins are identified in enterococci isolated from many environments, which most often include those of human origin.

TI  == enterococcal genomics
AB  == enterococcal genomics is a rapidly growing area of study. the first enterococcal  genome sequence-that of enterococcus faecalis v583-was published ten years ago (mcshan & shankar, 2002; paulsen, et al., 2003), and complete or draft genome sequences of various enterococcal strains and species now number in the hundreds  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). concurrent with rapid advances in genome sequencing, the sequencing-based classification scheme of multilocus sequence typing (mlst) has been used to interrogate population structures of the two enterococcal species that are most associated with human health and disease, e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium. these two species also constitute the bulk of  enterococcal genome sequence data that has been generated to date. this wealth of genomic data has allowed for an investigation of enterococcal diversity at a depth not previously achievable. genomic studies in enterococci have been driven  by overarching questions, such as: why do multiple species of enterococci exist that inhabit seemingly identical niches, such as e. faecalis and e. faecium in the human gut, and what ecological factors have contributed to their divergence from a common ancestor? within an enterococcal species such as e. faecalis or e.  faecium, what qualities distinguish one strain from another? are infection- or hospital-derived strains evolutionarily distinct from strains that benignly co-exist in the complex microbial consortium of the healthy human intestine? related to this, have antibiotic use and the nosocomial environment led to changes in the enterococcal genome and/or its population structure? this chapter  highlights major advances in enterococcal genomics, including the development of  mlst schemes to study the population structures of e. faecalis and e. faecium; comparative genome hybridization (cgh) studies to catalog the genomic contents of hundreds of e. faecalis and e. faecium strains; and significant findings from genome sequencing of multiple enterococcal species, beginning with the discovery  and sequencing of the e. faecalis pathogenicity island (pai). additionally, we review the use of genome resequencing as a tool to study the short-term evolution of e. faecalis and the use of metagenomics to assemble in situ enterococcal genomes. in concluding the chapter, we discuss future perspectives in enterococcal genomics, including pressing questions that should drive future research in this field. while comparative genomics in enterococci has rapidly advanced over the last ten years, the number of genomes discussed here pales in comparison to what has been emerging-136 enterococcal genomes have been sequenced as part of the human microbiome project (http://www.hmpdacc.org/), and 406 more were sequenced in a large-scale enterococcal genome sequencing endeavor performed in a multi-national collaboration with the broad institute (cambridge, ma). clearly, our foray into enterococcal genomics has only just begun.

TI  == the physiology and metabolism of enterococci
AB  == when possible, the authors have provided open reading frame (orf) numbers (ef####) from the extensively annotated e. faecalis v583 genome sequence. this information can be easily accessed at enterocyc.broadinstitute.org. if applicable, non-v583 enterococcal sequences with homology to the annotated orf have been supplied. additionally, we have included iubmb nomenclature for most reactions, which are available at http://www.iubmb.org. enterococci have been isolated and characterized for more than 113 years (maccallum & hastings, 1899).  during the past century, the classification of this genus has been refined, with  the most significant change occurring in 1984 when most members of the group d streptococci, including streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium, were included in the new genus enterococcus (schleifer & kilpper-balz, 1984). this genus currently consists of 37 species that occupy a broad range of habitats that include the gastrointestinal microbiota of nearly every animal phylum (see enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization for details). an  ability to widely colonize is due, at least in part, to their metabolic versatility and intrinsic resistance to inhospitable conditions. despite being unable to form spores, enterococci are highly tolerant to desiccation and can persist for months on dried surfaces. enterococci also tolerate extremes of ph, ionizing radiation, osmotic and oxidative stresses, high heavy metal concentrations, and antibiotics. enterococci survive or grow over a wide range of temperatures for mesophilic bacteria, from 10 to 45 degrees c. these bacteria, as highly evolved commensals, have been extensively used in the food industry and as probiotics to prevent or ameliorate disease. finally, rogue strains of enterococci have emerged on the worldwide stage as multidrug-resistant and hospital-acquired pathogens. enterococci are often simply described as lactic-acid-producing bacteria-a designation that understates their vast metabolic potential. the ubiquitous nature of enterococci in our environment implies this potential. investigations into the remarkable physiology of these bacteria have fluctuated over the past century. prior to publication of the enterococci (huycke m. m., 2002), and now with this volume, the last formal comprehensive review of enterococcal metabolism was written in 1964 (deibel, 1964). at that time, substantial efforts by gunsalus, sokatch, gale, niven, and deibel, among others, focused on the central metabolism of enterococci. since then, research into enterococcal physiology has increasingly used the tools of molecular biology and has shifted toward understanding antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and genomics. with this new information, there has been increasing  recognition that many metabolic genes and pathways vary, even within single species, and led investigators to question the concept of a uniform core metabolism for enterococci. to address this perspective and update the available  information on enterococcal physiology, this chapter compiles and reviews the most recent findings from laboratories around the world, and integrates those results with the older literature. as will be evident, the rapid growth of genomic databases continues to offer valuable insights into the physiology of enterococci and greatly facilitates experimental designs into their metabolism.

TI  == extrachromosomal and mobile elements in enterococci: transmission, maintenance, and epidemiology
AB  == extrachromosomal elements are ubiquitous in the prokaryotic world and play important roles in the adaptation and survival of cell populations, especially in changing environments. plasmids are readily found in enterococci, and it is not unusual for clinical and commensal strains (e.g. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) to harbor a number of such elements. indeed, plasmid-free isolates are only infrequently identified. enterococcal plasmids commonly encode: i) resistance to one or more antibiotics; ii) elevated resistance to ultraviolet  light; iii) virulence factors, such as cytolysin and aggregation substance; and iv) bacteriocins. in addition, intercellular transmissibility is frequently a plasmid-determined trait. as in many bacterial species, plasmids generally range  in size from 3-4 kb to well over 100 kb and may be present at relatively low copy number (1-2 copies) or up to 20 or more per cell. table 1 presents a list of enterococcal plasmids recently compiled by one of the authors (teresa m. coque).  conjugation is a primary means for intercellular dna mobility in enterococci-natural transformation has never been reported, and information is only beginning to be reported with regard to transduction involving a bacteriophage (see enterococcal bacteriophages and genome defense). some conjugative plasmids transfer efficiently from donor to recipient in broth, whereas others transfer well only on solid surfaces. in the case of e. faecalis,  peptide sex pheromones secreted by recipient cells induce conjugation-related mating functions, determined by certain plasmids (e.g. pad1, pcf10, and a host of others). another group of plasmids, such as pmg1 and related elements identified  mainly in e. faecium, are also able to transfer efficiently in broth, but do not  appear to make use of sex pheromones. a group of plasmids exemplified by pambeta1 do not transfer well in broth, but are able to move if the cells are on a solid surface. nonconjugative plasmids are also commonly present in enterococci, and some are readily mobilized by conjugative elements in trans or move via co-integration in some cases. representatives of some of the above-noted elements have been sequenced, and studies relating to their transfer mechanisms have been  published. in addition, reports relating to replication and partitioning provide  significant information on the ways in which certain transmissible elements are maintained in their host. other types of transmissible elements common in enterococci are the so-called conjugative transposons, which are exemplified by the tn916 family. usually found integrated in the chromosome, their movement involves an excision event that results in a non-replicative circular intermediate that is able to transfer conjugatively, followed by insertion into the genome of a recipient cell. originally identified in e. faecalis, these elements, which commonly encode antibiotic resistance traits, have a broad host range and are widespread among numerous bacterial genera. in a similar vein and as found to be the case for many species of bacteria in recent years, enterococci have been shown to carry a plethora of "genomic islands," some of which are mobile and called "integrative conjugative elements" (ices). some of these represent "pathogenicity islands" that confer significant virulence traits and even antibiotic resistance. rapidly accumulating genomic sequencing data are facilitating identification of the enterococcal "mobilome," which includes not only transmissible elements, but also insertion sequences, transposons, and integrons that move intracellularly. studies based on functionality, including replication and maintenance, complement this rapidly expanding picture, and the significant extent to which enterococci have participated in horizontal transfer  within the bacterial world is becoming readily apparent. below we attempt to summarize recent developments in various aspects of mobile genetic elements (mges) in enterococci and try to provide a perspective that is relevant to bacterial-human interaction.

TI  == enterococcal disease, epidemiology, and implications for treatment
AB  == during the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (arias & murray, 2012; austin, bonten, weinstein, slaughter, & anderson, 1999; boyce, et al., 1994; benenson, et al., 2009; goossens, 1998; handwerger, et al., 1993). the continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. this trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. the rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (vre) has been of particular concern. many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides. finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat vre infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (chow, donahedian, & zervos, 1997; herrero, issa, & patel, 2002; sabol, patterson, lewis ii, aaron, cadena, & jorgensen, 2005). over the past two decades, enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the united states (hidron, et al., 2008). e. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than e. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. approximately 40% of medical intensive care units in a recent national healthcare safety network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (80% and 90.4%, respectively) (hidron, et al., 2008). although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some  macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to e. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1% and 96.2%, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including e. durans, e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. hirae, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, and e. muntdii (gordon, et al., 1992). in the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of vre in clinical settings. finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.

TI  == enterococci as indicators of environmental fecal contamination
AB  == enterococci are found in high concentrations in human feces, usually between 104  and 106 bacteria per gram wet weight (layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010; slanetz & bartley, 1957; zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962); see also enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization). although enterococci usually represent less than 1% of the flora (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003), they are usually present in the fecal consortium, but are outnumbered by other bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridia, and the bacteroidales (zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962). due to their ubiquity in human feces and persistence in the environment, enterococci have been adopted as indicators of human fecal pollution in water. more recently, their densities on human hands have been used as indicators of hand hygiene. the use of enterococci as indicators of human fecal pollution or contamination can be problematic, however, because enterococci are also found in animal feces (harwood, whitlock, & withington, 2000; layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010), in soils (byappanahalli & fujioka, 2004; goto & yan, 2011), and on plants (byappanahalli, shively, nevers,  sadowsky, & whitman, 2003; imamura, thompson, boehm, & jay, 2011; muller, ulrich, ott, & muller, 2001). although there is debate about the extent to which this happens in nature, there is evidence that enterococci are capable of replicating  in extra-enteric environments, such as on beach sands (bahirathan, puente, & seyfried, 1998; zubrzycki & spaulding, 1962) and in water containing kelp (byappanahalli, shively, nevers, sadowsky, & whitman, 2003; imamura, thompson, boehm, & jay, 2011) and plankton (mote, turner, & lipp, 2012). identification of  human-specific enterococcal species or genotypes could aid in the discrimination  of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources of the organisms. some data suggest that enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis may be more prevalent in human feces than other enterococcal species, while enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii may be more abundant in environmental reservoirs (such as on plants) than other species (bahirathan, puente, & seyfried, 1998; ferguson, moore, getrich, & zhowandai, 2005; wheeler, hartel, godfrey, hill, & segars, 2002). however, a number of species of enterococcus have been isolated from human feces (layton, walters, lam, & boehm, 2010); enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization), so it will be difficult to derive a single host-specific indicator. it has been suggested that  e. faecium that contains the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene may be human-specific (scott, jenkins, lukasik, & rose, 2005), but esp-containing e. faecium can also be found in select animal hosts (layton, walters, & boehm, 2009; whitman, przybyla-kelly, shively, & byappanahalli, 2007). fecal enterococci from  the gi tract consortia of healthy humans are generally not virulent. nevertheless, multidrug-resistant enterococcus strains have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infections (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003). vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly important pathogens (willems, et al., 2005), as are esp-containing e. faecalis (shankar, baghdayan, huycke, lindahl, & gilmore, 1999) and e. faecium (willems, et al., 2001), as well as other types of e. faecalis and e. faecium (wisplinghoff, bischoff, tallent, seifert, wenzel, & edmond, 2004). it is estimated that there are 800,000 cases of enterococcal infection in the us each year, adding $500,000,000 to annual healthcare costs (tendolkar, baghdayan, & shankar, 2003). therefore, the presence of enterococci in the environment and on hands may have important direct health implications.

AB  == the clinical importance of the genus enterococcus is directly related to its antibiotic resistance, which contributes to the risk of colonization and infection. the species of the greatest clinical importance are enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. although the resistance characteristics of these two species differ in important ways, they can generally be categorized as  intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance, and tolerance. relative to the streptococci, enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents. all enterococci exhibit decreased susceptibility to penicillin and ampicillin, as well as high-level resistance to most cephalosporins and all semi-synthetic penicillins, as the result of expression of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. for many strains, their level of resistance to ampicillin does not preclude the clinical use of this agent. in fact, ampicillin remains the treatment of choice for enterococcal infections that lack other mechanisms for high-level resistance. enterococci are also intrinsically resistant to clindamycin, which is mediated by the product of the lsa gene, although the mechanism remains poorly defined. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appears to be active against enterococci when tested in vitro on folate-deficient media, but fails in animal models, presumably because enterococci can absorb folate from the environment (zervos & schaberg, 1985). enterococci also have a native resistance to clinically achievable concentrations of aminoglycosides, which precludes their use as single agents. although e. faecalis is naturally resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin, this combination is highly active against e. faecium strains that lack specific resistance determinants. enterococci are tolerant to the (normally) bactericidal  activity of cell-wall active agents, such as beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin. tolerance implies that the bacteria can be inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the antibiotic, but will only be killed by concentrations far in excess of the inhibitory concentration. enterococcal tolerance can be overcome by combining cell-wall active agents with an aminoglycoside. the mechanism by which beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combinations yield synergistic bactericidal activity remains a mystery, but in vitro data indicate that a higher concentration of aminoglycoside enters cells that are also treated with agents that inhibit cell wall synthesis, which suggests that the cell wall active agents promote uptake of the aminoglycoside (mohr, friedrich, yankelev, & lamp, 2009). tolerance is normally detected in vitro by plotting survival in kill curves, and can be observed for a number of antibiotic-bacteria  combinations. in vitro tolerance has an important impact on therapy for treating  enterococcal infections. the treatment of endocarditis requires bactericidal therapy, due to the inaccessibility of the bacteria within the cardiac vegetations to the mammalian immune system. recognition of synergism between penicillin-streptomycin led to an improvement in cure rates for enterococcal endocarditis, from approximately 40% to greater than 80% (jensen, frimodt-moller, & aarestrup, 1999; rice & carias, 1998). despite considerable effort, investigators have yet to find other combinations of antibiotics that are synergistically bactericidal against enterococci. in addition to intrinsic resistance and tolerance, enterococci have been extraordinarily successful at rapidly acquiring resistance to virtually any antimicrobial agent put into clinical use. introduction of chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracyclines was quickly followed by the emergence of resistance, in some cases reaching a prevalence that precluded their empirical use. while the occurrence of ampicillin resistance in e. faecalis has been quite rare, there is now widespread, high-level resistance to ampicillin among clinical e. faecium isolates. high-level aminoglycoside resistance, which negates the synergism between cell-wall active agents and aminoglycosides, has been recognized for several decades. vancomycin resistance is widely prevalent in e. faecium, although it remains relatively rare in e. faecalis. in response to the growing problem of vancomycin resistance in enterococci, the pharmaceutical industry has developed a number of newer agents that have activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). however, none of these newly licensed agents (quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) has been entirely free of resistance. thus, the widespread resistance of enterococci has had a substantial impact on our use of both empirical and definitive antibiotics for the treatment of enterococcal infections, a situation that is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.

TI  == daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a worldwide surveillance programme (2005-2012).
AB  == we report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the daptomycin surveillance programme worldwide. consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods.  a total of 164457 gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 29619 enterococci and 15883 beta-haemolytic streptococci. the prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among cons (0.19%), followed by enterococcus faecium (0.18%), s. aureus (0.05%), enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. against s. aureus, the daptomycin mic(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/l in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible s. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin mic value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. daptomycin was also active against cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.81% susceptible), e. faecalis (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.98% susceptible), e. faecium (mic(50/90), 2/4 mg/l; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 99.76%  susceptible), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). in conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.

TI  == drug-resistant and hospital-associated enterococcus faecium from wastewater, riverine estuary and anthropogenically impacted marine catchment basin.
AB  == background: enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play  an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (hais). it is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (hireccs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. the aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of hirrecc-related e. faecium. results: two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps), their marine outfalls  and vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in gulf of gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of enterococcus spp. four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including e. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), e. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and e. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (e. gallinarum/casseliflavus, e. durans and e. avium) accounted for 1.9%. antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among e. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated  with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing hirecc, formerly called cc17. these isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (mge), a feature also typical for nosocomial hirecc. conclusions: our data show that wwtps constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of mge, for the recipient water  environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. the presence of hireccs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. there is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination.

TI  == comparison between automated system and pcr-based method for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of clinical enterococcus spp.
AB  == enterococci are increasingly responsible for nosocomial infections worldwide. this study was undertaken to compare the identification and susceptibility profile using an automated microsscan system, pcr-based assay and disk diffusion  assay of enterococcus spp. we evaluated 30 clinical isolates of enterococcus spp. isolates were identified by microsscan system and pcr-based assay. the detection  of antibiotic resistance genes (vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and erythromycin) was also determined by pcr. antimicrobial susceptibilities to vancomycin (30 microg), gentamicin (120 microg), tetracycline (30 microg) and erythromycin (15 microg) were tested by the automated system and disk diffusion method, and were interpreted according to the criteria recommended in clsi guidelines. concerning enterococcus identification the general agreement between  data obtained by the pcr method and by the automatic system was 90.0% (27/30). for all isolates of e. faecium and e. faecalis we observed 100% agreement. resistance frequencies were higher in e. faecium than e. faecalis. the resistance rates obtained were higher for erythromycin (86.7%), vancomycin (80.0%), tetracycline (43.35) and gentamicin (33.3%). the correlation between disk diffusion and automation revealed an agreement for the majority of the antibiotics with category agreement rates of > 80%. the pcr-based assay, the van(a) gene was detected in 100% of vancomycin resistant enterococci. this assay  is simple to conduct and reliable in the identification of clinically relevant enterococci. the data obtained reinforced the need for an improvement of the automated system to identify some enterococci.

TI  == significance and survival of enterococci during the house fly development.
AB  == house flies are among the most important nonbiting insect pests of medical and veterinary importance. larvae develop in decaying organic substrates and their survival strictly depends on an active microbial community. house flies have been implicated in the ecology and transmission of enterococci, including multi-antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of enterococcus faecalis. in this study, eight american type culture collection type strains of enterococci including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcusfaecalis, and enterococcusfaecium were evaluated for their significance in the development of house flies from eggs to adults in bacterial feeding assays. furthermore, the bacterial colonization of the gut of teneral flies as well as the importance of several virulence traits of e. faecalis in larval mortality was assessed. overall survival of house flies (egg to adult) was significantly higher when grown with typically nonpathogenic enterococcal species such as e. hirae (76.0% survival), e. durans (64.0%), and e. avium (64.0%) compared with that with clinically important species e. faecalis (24.0%) and e. faecium (36.0%). however, no significant differences in survival of house fly larvae were detected when grown with e. faecalis strains carrying various virulence traits, including isogenic mutants of the human clinical isolate e. faecalis v583 with in-frame deletions of gelatinase, serine protease, and capsular polysaccharide serotype c. enterococci were commonly detected in fly puparia (range: 75-100%; concentration: 103-105 cfu/puparium);however, the prevalence of enterococci in teneral flies varied greatly: from 25.0 (e. casseliflavus) to 89.5% (e. hirae). in conclusion, depending on the species, enterococci variably support house fly larval development and colonize the gut of teneral adults. the human pathogenic species, e. faecalis and e. faecium, poorly  support larval development and are likely acquired in nature by adult flies during feeding. house fly larvae do not appear to be a suitable model organism for assessment of enterococcal virulence traits.

TI  == performance of the eucast disk diffusion method, the clsi agar screen method, and the vitek 2 automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing system for detection of clinical isolates of enterococci with low- and medium-level vanb-type vancomycin resistance: a multicenter study.
AB  == different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods to detect low-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci were evaluated in a scandinavian multicenter study (n=28). a phenotypically and genotypically well-characterized diverse collection of enterococcus faecalis (n=12) and enterococcus faecium (n=18) strains with and without nonsusceptibility to vancomycin was examined blindly in  danish (n=5), norwegian (n=13), and swedish (n=10) laboratories using the eucast  disk diffusion method (n=28) and the clsi agar screen (n=18) or the vitek 2 system (biomerieux) (n=5). the eucast disk diffusion method (very major error [vme] rate, 7.0%; sensitivity, 0.93; major error [me] rate, 2.4%; specificity, 0.98) and clsi agar screen (vme rate, 6.6%; sensitivity, 0.93; me rate, 5.6%; specificity, 0.94) performed significantly better (p=0.02) than the vitek 2 system (vme rate, 13%; sensitivity, 0.87; me rate, 0%; specificity, 1). the performance of the eucast disk diffusion method was challenged by differences in  vancomycin inhibition zone sizes as well as the experience of the personnel in interpreting fuzzy zone edges as an indication of vancomycin resistance. laboratories using oxoid agar (p<0.0001) or merck mueller-hinton (mh) agar (p=0.027) for the disk diffusion assay performed significantly better than did laboratories using bbl mh ii medium. laboratories using difco brain heart infusion (bhi) agar for the clsi agar screen performed significantly better (p=0.017) than did those using oxoid bhi agar. in conclusion, both the eucast disk diffusion and clsi agar screening methods performed acceptably (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.94 to 0.98) in the detection of vanb-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci with low-level resistance. importantly, use of the clsi agar screen requires careful monitoring of the vancomycin concentration  in the plates. moreover, disk diffusion methodology requires that personnel be trained in interpreting zone edges.

TI  == enterococcus infection biology: lessons from invertebrate host models.
AB  == the enterococci are commensals of the gastrointestinal tract of many metazoans, from insects to humans. while they normally do not cause disease in the intestine, they can become pathogenic when they infect sites outside of the gut.  recently, the enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with the majority of human enterococcal infections caused by two species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. studies using invertebrate infection models have revealed insights into the biology of enterococcal infections, as well as general principles underlying host innate immune defense. this review highlights  recent findings on enterococcus infection biology from two invertebrate infection models, the greater wax moth galleria mellonella and the free-living bacteriovorous nematode caenorhabditis elegans.

TI  == daptomycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cement for joint arthroplasty surgery.
AB  == antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement has been frequently used as an infection prophylaxis or antibiotic-loaded spacer in infected arthroplasty. in addition, daptomycin has been used recently against broad spectrum gram-positive organisms. the goal of this in vitro study is to investigate the bacteriacidal and mechanical properties of daptomycin-incorporated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) bone cement and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use. daptomycin (0.5, 1, or 2 g) was premixed with 40 g of pmma bone cement powder before curing. the mechanical properties of the daptomycin-loaded acrylic bone cement (dlabc) were estimated following standard guidance, and the release profile and kinetics of daptomycin from pmma were analyzed. the antimicrobial efficacy of dlabc was determined with a zone of inhibition (zoi) assay against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium, respectively. the results showed that the compressive strength, of pmma bone cement, which was higher than 100 mpa in all groups, was sufficient according to  iso 5833 after incorporation of daptomycin. the encapsulated daptomycin was released for 2 weeks with a 9.59 +/- 0.85%, 15.25 +/- 0.69%, and 20.64 +/- 20.33% released percentage on the first day in the low, mid, and high groups, respectively. according to the calculated release kinetics, incorporated daptomycin should be 3.3 times the original dose to double its release. although  all recipes of dlabc had a microbial inhibitory effect, the effect with a higher  encapsulated amount of daptomycin was more significant. therefore, we believe that daptomycin can be locally delivered from pmma bone cement at the surgical site as a prophylactic or treatment for osteomyelitis against gram-positive organisms with intact cement function.

AB  == enterococci are gram-positive cocci saprophyte of the human gastrointestinal tract, diners who act as opportunistic pathogens. they can cause infections in patients hospitalized for a long time or who have received multiple antibiotic therapy. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are the most common species in human infections. to evaluate the possibility of rapid detection of these species and their occurrence in the blood of newborns with suspected nosocomial infection, blood samples were collected from 50 newborns with late infections, admitted to the neonatal care unit of the university hospital federal de mato grosso do sul (ufms-hu), from september 2010 to january 2011. the samples were subjected to conventional pcr and real time pcr (qpcr) to search for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. the pcr results were compared with respective blood cultures from 40 patients. no blood cultures  were positive for enterococci, however, eight blood samples were identified as genomic dna of enterococcus faecium by qpcr and 22 blood samples were detected as genomic dna of enterococcus faecalis by conventional pcr. these findings are important because of the clinical severity of the evaluated patients who were found positive by conventional pcr and not through routine microbiological methods.

TI  == bacterial community migration in the ripening of doenjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean food.
AB  == doenjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean paste, is made by mixing and ripening meju with high salt brine (approximately 18%). meju is a naturally fermented soybean block prepared by soaking, steaming, and molding soybean. to understand living bacterial community migration and the roles of bacteria in the  manufacturing process of doenjang, the diversity of culturable bacteria in meju and doenjang was examined using media supplemented with nacl, and some physiological activities of predominant isolates were determined. bacilli were the major bacteria involved throughout the entire manufacturing process from meju to doenjang; some of these bacteria might be present as spores during the doenjang ripening process. bacillus siamensis was the most populous species of the genus, and bacillus licheniformis exhibited sufficient salt tolerance to maintain its growth during doenjang ripening. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the major lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified in this study, did not continue to grow under high nacl conditions in doenjang. enterococci and certain species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were the predominant acid-producing bacteria in meju fermentation, whereas tetragenococcus halophilus and cns were the major acid-producing bacteria in doenjang fermentation. we conclude that bacilli, lab, and cns may be the major bacterial groups involved in meju fermentation and that these bacterial communities undergo a shift toward salt-tolerant bacilli, cns, and t. halophilus  during the doenjang fermentation process.

TI  == metagenomic analysis of the stool microbiome in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation: loss of diversity is associated with use of systemic antibiotics and more pronounced in gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease.
AB  == next-generation sequencing of the hypervariable v3 region of the 16s rrna gene isolated from serial stool specimens collected from 31 patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (sct) was performed to elucidate variations  in the composition of the intestinal microbiome in the course of allogeneic sct.  metagenomic analysis was complemented by strain-specific enterococcal pcr and indirect assessment of bacterial load by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of urinary indoxyl sulfate. at the time of admission, patients showed a predominance of commensal bacteria. after transplantation, a relative shift toward enterococci was observed, which was more pronounced under antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment of neutropenic infections. the shift was particularly prominent in patients that developed subsequently or suffered from active gastrointestinal (gi) graft-versus-host disease (gvhd). the mean proportion of enterococci in post-transplant stool specimens was 21% in patients who did not develop gi gvhd as compared with 46% in those that subsequently developed gi gvhd and 74% at the time of active gvhd. enterococcal pcr confirmed predominance of enterococcus faecium or both e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis in these specimens. as a consequence of the loss of bacterial diversity, mean urinary indoxyl sulfate levels dropped from 42.5 +/- 11 mumol/l to 11.8 +/- 2.8 mumol/l in all post-transplant samples and to 3.5 +/- 3 mumol/l in samples from patients  with active gvhd. our study reveals major microbiome shifts in the course of allogeneic sct that occur in the period of antibiotic treatment but are more prominent in association with gi gvhd. our data indicate early microbiome shifts  and a loss of diversity of the intestinal microbiome that may affect intestinal inflammation in the setting of allogeneic sct.

AB  == vitek 2 (biomerieux, inc., durham, nc) is a widely used commercial antimicrobial  susceptibility testing system. we compared mic results obtained by vitek 2 to those obtained by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution (bmd) reference method for 134 staphylococcal and 84 enterococcal clinical isolates. nineteen agents were evaluated, including all those available  on vitek 2 for testing staphylococci and enterococci. the resistance phenotypes tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 58), s. aureus with inducible clindamycin resistance (icr) (n = 30), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant mrsa (n = 10), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (n = 37), high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococcus (n = 15), linezolid-resistant enterococcus (n = 5), and daptomycin-nonsusceptible enterococcus faecalis (n = 6). for the staphylococci, there was 98.9% categorical agreement (ca). there was one very major error (vme) for gentamicin in a staphylococcus hominis isolate, six vmes for inducible clindamycin in s. aureus isolates, and two major errors (me) for daptomycin in an s. aureus and a staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. for enterococci, there was 97.3% ca. two vmes were observed for daptomycin in isolates of e. faecalis and 2 me, 1 for high-level gentamicin resistance and 1 for nitrofurantoin, in e. faecium isolates. overall, there was 98.3% ca and 99% essential agreement for the testing of staphylococci and enterococci by the vitek 2. with the exception of detecting  icr in s. aureus, vitek 2 performed reliably for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand).
AB  == to determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. in total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of escherichia coli,  enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (e.  coli), 69.2% (e. faecalis) and 92.2% (e. faecium). resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in e. coli (48.8%), e. faecalis (17.9%) and e. faecium (82.8%). the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. the factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. these results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.

TI  == prevalence of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia resistance gene and its linkage to tn5281 in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates from tabriz hospitals.
AB  == background and objective: high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr: mic >/= 500 microg/ml) in enterococci is mediated by aminoglycoside modifying enzymes which is mainly encoded by aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene. the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene in clinical isolates of enterococcus facium and enterococcus faecalis collected from hospitals in northwest of iran. materials and methods: in the present study a total of 111 enterococcus isolates were collected from 4 hospitals during a two year period (july 2009-august 2011). bacterial identification and species determination were  carried out by standard biochemical tests. antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by kirby bauer disc diffusion method. mics were determined by agar dilution method. the frequency of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene in the isolates was determined by pcr. the carriage of resistance gene on tn5281 transposon was identified by long pcr and dot-blot hybridization methods. results: antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that the highest resistance was against streptomycin (74.77%) and erythromycin (67.58%) whereas the highest susceptibility was observed to vancomycin (81.1%). 36 isolates (32.43%) were identified as hlgr, 34(94.44%) of them had resistant gene in their genome. long pcr studies revealed that 88% of hlgr clinical isolates harboured tn5281. the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia resistance gene was present on tn5281 transposon in all 32 isolates according to dot blot hybridization test. conclusion: the results of this study indicated that aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia resistance gene is highly prevalent in gentamicin resistant isolates. carriage of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia resistance gene on tn5281 transposable element suggests possible contribution of  this transposone on dissemination of resistance gene among enterococcus isolates.

TI  == evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  == to date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. as a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and  resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) distributions for four common  biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on staphylococcus aureus (n = 1635) and salmonella spp. (n = 901) but also including escherichia coli (n = 368), candida albicans (n = 200), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 60), enterobacter spp. (n = 54), enterococcus faecium (n = 53), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 56). from these data epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) are proposed. as would be expected, mbcs were higher than mics for all biocides. in most cases both values  followed a normal distribution. bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for enterobacter chlorhexidine  susceptibility (both mics and mbcs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of enterobacter (mbc), e. coli (mbc and mic) and s. aureus (mbc and mic). there is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) is associated with the pathogenesis  of ibs. this study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against sibo micro-organisms from humans. fluid was aspirated from the  third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed sibo in 117 patients (20.6%). a total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. at a breakpoint of 32 mug/ml, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of escherichia coli,  43.6% of klebsiella spp., 34.8% of enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negative spp., 100% of enterococcus faecalis, 100% of enterococcus faecium and 100% of staphylococcus aureus. for the time-kill assays, 11 e. coli, 15 non-e. coli gram-negative enterobacteria and three e. faecalis isolates were studied. rifaximin produced a  >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/ml after 24h of growth. the results indicate that rifaximin has a potent  effect on specific small bowel flora associated with sibo. this conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == catheter removal versus retention in the management of catheter-associated enterococcal bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: enterococci are an important cause of central venous catheter (cvc)-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsi). it is unclear whether cvc removal is necessary to successfully manage enterococcal ca-bsi. methods: a 12-month retrospective cohort study of adults with enterococcal ca-bsi was conducted at a tertiary care hospital; clinical, microbiological and outcome data were collected. results: a total of 111 patients had an enterococcal ca-bsi. the  median age was 58.2 years (range 21 to 94 years). there were 45 (40.5%) infections caused by entercoccus faecalis (among which 10 [22%] were vancomycin resistant), 61 (55%) by enterococcus faecium (57 [93%] vancomycin resistant) and  five (4.5%) by other enterococcus species. patients were treated with linezolid (n=51 [46%]), vancomycin (n=37 [33%]), daptomycin (n=11 [10%]), ampicillin (n=2 [2%]) or quinupristin/dalfopristin (n=2 [2%]); seven (n=6%) patients did not receive adequate enterococcal treatment. additionally, 24 (22%) patients received adjunctive gentamicin treatment. the cvc was retained in 29 (26.1%) patients. patients with removed cvcs showed lower rates of in-hospital mortality (15 [18.3%] versus 11 [37.9]; p=0.03), but similar rates of recurrent bacteremia (nine [11.0%] versus two (7.0%); p=0.7) and a similar post-bsi length of hospital stay (median days [range]) (11.1 [1.7 to 63.1 days] versus 9.3 [1.9 to 31.8 days]; p=0.3). catheter retention was an independent predictor of mortality (or 3.34 [95% ci 1.21 to 9.26]). conclusions: to the authors' knowledge, the present  article describes the largest enterococcal ca-bsi series to date. mortality was increased among patients who had their catheter retained. additional prospective  studies are necessary to determine the optimal management of enterococcal ca-bsi.

TI  == seasonal variations in bacterial communities and antibiotic-resistant strains associated with green bottle flies (diptera: calliphoridae).
AB  == green bottle flies occur frequently around human environments in japan. many species of green bottle flies have been studied with regard to their importance in forensic examinations or clinical therapies, but the bacterial communities associated with this group of flies have not been comprehensively investigated. in this research, 454 pyrosequencing was used to reveal the bacterial communities in green bottle flies collected in different seasons. meanwhile, the bacteria were screened with selective media and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. samples collected in three different seasons harbored distinctive bacterial communities. the predominant genera associated with green bottles flies were staphylococcus in spring, ignatzschineria in summer, and vagococcus, dysgonomonas, and an unclassified acetobacteraceae in autumn. an upward trend in  bacterial community diversity was observed from spring to autumn. changes in climatic conditions could be the cause of these seasonal variations in fly-associated bacterial communities. the species of isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria also differed across seasons, but it was difficult  to correlate seasonal changes in antibiotic-resistant bacteria with changes in whole communities. a number of multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated, and some of these strains were closely affiliated with pathogens such as enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, which could cause serious threats to public health. overall, this research provided us with information about the composition and seasonality of bacterial communities in green bottle flies, and highlighted the risks of fly-mediated dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in enterococcus faecium clinical isolates.
AB  == the worldwide ratio of enterococcus faecalis-enterococcus faecium infections is currently changing in favor of e. faecium. intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance traits of this latter species can explain this evolution as well as the diffusion of hospital-adapted strains belonging to the clonal complex cc17. like other enterococci, e. faecium is naturally resistant to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides (at low level). because of its high genome plasticity, it can also acquire numerous other resistances. it is noteworthy that most modern isolates of e. faecium are highly resistant to ampicillin while a non-negligible  proportion of them (depending on geographical locations) are resistant to glycopeptides (especially in the usa). even if resistance to newer antimicrobial  agents (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) is still uncommon, some clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance have already been reported and better understanding of resistance mechanisms is needed for prediction and prevention of their dissemination.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of enterococcal bacteremia in australia.
AB  == enterococci are a major cause of health care-associated infections and account for approximately 10% of all bacteremias globally. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteremia isolates in australia that are antimicrobial resistant, with particular emphasis on susceptibility to ampicillin and the glycopeptides, and to characterize the molecular epidemiology  of the enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. from 1 january to 31 december 2011, 1,079 unique episodes of bacteremia were investigated, of which 95.8% were caused by either e. faecalis (61.0%) or e. faecium (34.8%). the majority of bacteremias were health care associated, and approximately one-third  were polymicrobial. ampicillin resistance was detected in 90.4% of e. faecium isolates but was not detected in e. faecalis isolates. vancomycin nonsusceptibility was reported in 0.6% and 36.5% of e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, respectively. unlike europe and the united states, where vancomycin resistance in e. faecium is predominately due to the acquisition of the vana operon, 98.4% of e. faecium isolates harboring van genes carried the vanb operon, and 16.1% of the vanb e. faecium isolates had vancomycin mics at or below the susceptible breakpoint of the clsi. although molecular typing identified 126 e. faecalis pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pulsotypes, >50% belonged to two pulsotypes that were isolated across australia. e. faecium consisted of 73 pulsotypes from which 43 multilocus sequence types were identified. almost 90% of the e. faecium isolates were identified as cc17 clones, of which approximately half were characterized as st203, which was isolated australia-wide. in conclusion, the australian enterococcal sepsis outcome programme (aesop) study has shown that although they are polyclonal, enterococcal bacteremias in australia are frequently caused by ampicillin-resistant vanb e. faecium.

AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing problem in canada and worldwide. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are strains of enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis that contain genes conferring resistance to vancomycin. escherichia coli (e. coli), klebsiella pneumonia (k. pneumonia), and  other gram-negative bacteria may produce the enzymes known as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). these have the ability to inactivate beta lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, and the cephalosporins. the presence  and growth (colonization) of vre and esbl-producing micro-organisms in the gastrointestinal tract is usually of no consequence for the host, but under certain circumstances, such as immunosuppression, gastrointestinal surgery, or physical debilitation, they may serve as a source of infection for the carrier. these hosts may also serve as a reservoir for the transmission of vre and esbl-producing organisms to other persons. results from the canadian nosocomial infection surveillance program showed that from 1999 to 2005, the rate of vre colonization and vre infection increased from 0.37 to 1.32 cases, and from 0.02 to 0.05 cases respectively per 1,000 patients admitted to hospital. the laboratory-based canadian ward surveillance study in 2008 found that esbl-producing e. coli were identified in all canadian geographic regions, and that 4.9% of e. coli isolates were esbl producers. specific prevention and control measures for antibiotic-resistant organisms (aros) include screening (a process to identify persons colonized with aros) and isolation of the carriers. hospital infection prevention and control strategies have been developed in some  canadian jurisdictions, and these are compatible with other national and international documents. non-specific strategies for controlling aro transmission and infection include hand hygiene; environmental cleaning; antimicrobial stewardship; and bundled practices, such as those to prevent central line-associated blood stream infections. antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as  vre and esbl-producers, lead to the increased use of hospital resources due to extended hospital stays, laboratory tests, physician consultations, costly medications if therapy for a vre or esbl-related infection were to arise, and the need to adhere to infection prevention and control measures to prevent the further spread of these pathogens. some of the increased resource usage results from the morbidity caused by vre or esbl-producing organism infections, while some is a consequence of control strategies. for example, it may be harder to transfer a patient to a rehabilitation facility if they are currently in isolation, which will in and of itself, prolong the length of stay. the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical evidence for the effectiveness of screening, isolation, and decolonization strategies for persons  colonized or infected with vre and esbl-producing organisms in acute and long-term care facilities. the health services impact of these strategies will be discussed.

TI  == co-transfer of resistance to high concentrations of copper and first-line antibiotics among enterococcus from different origins (humans, animals, the environment and foods) and clonal lineages.
AB  == objectives: we studied the occurrence of diverse copper (cu) tolerance genes from gram-positive bacteria and their co-transfer with antibiotic resistance genes among enterococcus from diverse sources. methods: enterococcus (n = 922) of several species and from human, animal, environment and food samples were included. antimicrobial and cuso4 susceptibility and conjugation assays were performed by standard procedures, bacterial screening of cu and antibiotic resistance genes by pcr, and clonality by pfge/multilocus sequence typing. results: tcrb and cueo genes occurred in 15% (n = 137/922) and 14% (n = 128/922)  of isolates, respectively, with the highest occurrence in piggeries (p < 0.05). they were more frequent among enterococcus faecium (tcrb: 23% versus 8% in enterococcus faecalis and 12% in other species; cueo: 25% versus 5% and 9%, respectively; p < 0.05). a correlation between phenotypic and genotypic assays was observed for most e. faecium (cuso4 mic50 = 24 mm in tcrb/cueo(+) versus cuso4 mic50 = 12 mm in tcrb/cueo(-)), but not for other species. co-transfer of cu tolerance (associated with tcrb, cueo or an unknown mechanism) with erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, aminoglycosides or ampicillin resistance  was demonstrated. a variety of pfge types was detected among isolates carrying cu tolerance mechanisms, some identified in sequence types (sts) often linked to human infections (e. faecium from st18 and st78 clonal lineages and e. faecalis clonal complex 2). conclusions: cu tolerance might contribute to the selection/maintenance of multidrug-resistant enterococcus (including resistance to first-line antibiotics used to treat enterococcal infections) due to the use of cu compounds (e.g. antiseptics/animal feed supplements). the distribution of the multicopper oxidase cueo and the co-transfer of ampicillin resistance along with cu tolerance genes are described for the first time.

TI  == impact of enterococcal colonization and infection in solid organ transplantation  recipients from the swiss transplant cohort study.
AB  == background: the burden of enterococcal infections has increased over the last decades with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) being a major health problem. solid organ transplantation is considered as a risk factor. however, little is known about the relevance of enterococci in solid organ transplantation recipients in areas with a low vre prevalence. methods: we examined the epidemiology of enterococcal events in patients followed in the swiss transplant  cohort study between may 2008 and september 2011 and analyzed risk factors for infection, aminopenicillin resistance, treatment, and outcome. results: of the 1234 patients, 255 (20.7%) suffered from 392 enterococcal events (185 [47.2%] infections, 205 [52.3%] colonizations, and 2 events with missing clinical information). only 2 isolates were vre. the highest infection rates were found early after liver transplantation (0.24/person-year) consisting in 58.6% of enterococcus faecium. the highest colonization rates were documented in lung transplant recipients (0.33/person-year), with 46.5% e. faecium. age, prophylaxis with a betalactam antibiotic, and liver transplantation were significantly associated with infection. previous antibiotic treatment, intensive care unit stay, and lung transplantation were associated with aminopenicillin resistance. only 4/205 (2%) colonization events led to an infection. adequate treatment did not affect microbiological clearance rates. overall mortality was 8%; no deaths were attributable to enterococcal events. conclusions: enterococcal colonizations and infections are frequent in transplant recipients. progression from colonization to infection is rare. therefore, antibiotic treatment should be used restrictively in colonization. no increased mortality because of enterococcal infection was noted.

TI  == antibiotic resistance, virulence determinants and production of biogenic amines among enterococci from ovine, feline, canine, porcine and human milk.
AB  == background: recent studies have shown that mammalian milk represents a continuous supply of commensal bacteria, including enterococci. the objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence of enterococci in milk of different species and to  screen them for several genetic and phenotypic traits of clinical significance among enterococci. results: samples were obtained from, at least, nine porcine, canine, ovine, feline and human healthy hosts. enterococci could be isolated, at  a concentration of 1.00 x 10(2) -1.16 x 10(3) cfu/ml, from all the porcine samples and, also from 85, 50, 25 and 25% of the human, canine, feline and ovine  ones, respectively. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus durans.  among the 120 initial enterococcal isolates, 36 were selected on the basis of their different pfge profiles and further characterized. mlst analysis revealed a wide diversity of sts among the e. faecalis and e. faecium strains, including some frequently associated to hospital infections and novel sts. all the e. faecalis strains possessed some of the potential virulence determinants (cad, ccf, cob, cpd, efaa(fs), agg2, gele, cyla, esp(fs)) assayed while the e. faecium  ones only harboured the efaa(fm) gene. all the tested strains were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin, and produced tyramine. their susceptibility to the rest of the antimicrobials and their ability to produce other biogenic amines varied depending on the strain. enterococci strains isolated from porcine samples showed the widest spectrum of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: enterococci isolated from milk of different mammals showed a great genetic diversity. the wide distribution of virulence genes and/or antibiotic resistance among the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates indicates that they can constitute a reservoir of such traits and a risk to animal and human health.

TI  == virulence and antimicrobial resistance in enterococci isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common nosocomial infection among hospitalized patients. meanwhile, most frequent infections involving enterococci affect the urinary tract. the aims of this study were to investigate  the susceptibility pattern of isolated enterococci from uti and the prevalence of virulence genes. methods: the study used enterococci isolated from urinary tract  infections obtained from 3 university teaching hospitals in northwest iran. the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains was determined using the disc diffusion method. multiplex pcr was performed for the detection of genus- species specific targets, and potential virulence genes. results: of 188 enterococcal isolates, 138 (73.4%) and 50 (26.6%) were enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility testing showed high resistance to amikacin (86.2%), rifampicin (86.2%) and erythromycin (73.9%), irrespective of species. in total, 68.1% were positive for gele, and 57.4%, 53.2%, 56.4%, and 52.1% of isolates were positive for cpd, asa1, ace, and esp, respectively. conclusion: the study revealed that most of uti isolates were multidrug resistance against the antibiotics tested and antibiotic resistance was more common among e. faecium isolates than e. faecalis. a significant correlation was  found between uti and the presence of gele among e. faecalis strains (p < 0.001).

TI  == characterization of veterinary hospital-associated isolates of enterococcus species in korea.
AB  == possible cross-transmission of hospital-associated enterococci between human patients, medical staff, and hospital environments has been extensively studied.  however, limited information is available for veterinary hospital-associated enterococcus isolates. this study investigated the possibility of cross-transmission of antibiotic-resistant enterococci between dog patients, their owners, veterinary staff, and hospital environments. swab samples (n =46 5) were obtained from five veterinary hospitals in seoul, korea, during 2011. forty-three enterococcus strains were isolated, representing seven enterococcal species. e. faecalis and e. faecium were the most dominant species (16 isolates each, 37.2%). although slight differences in the antibiotic resistance profiles were observed between the phenotypic and the genotypic data, our antibiogram analysis demonstrated high prevalence of the multiple drug-resistant (mdr) isolates of e. faecalis (10/16 isolates, 62.5%) and e. faecium (12/16 isolates, 75.0%). pulsed-field gel electrophoretic comparison of the mdr isolates revealed  three different clonal sets of e. faecalis and a single set of e. faecium, which  were isolated from different sample groups or dog patients at the same or two separate veterinary hospitals. these results imply a strong possibility of cross-transmission of the antibiotic-resistant enterococcal species between animal patients, owners, veterinary staff, and hospital environments.

TI  == molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in serbia: intensive care unit as the source.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular relatedness of clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) collected from patients of the clinic for infectious and tropical diseases in belgrade. among 40 isolates available for the investigation, 36 were identified as enterococcus faecium, whereas 2 were enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus, respectively. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) typing revealed 21 strain types, comprising 7 clusters which contained at least two isolates and 14 unique pfge patterns. although we searched for pathogenicity factor genes (gele, cylb, asa1,  efaafs, esp, cpd, cob) in representatives of all macro-restriction patterns, they have been confirmed in only one clone of e. faecalis. genes esp and hyl, commonly found in e. faecium, were yilded in 10 macro-restriction patterns of this species, and their presence could not be ascribed to clonally related strains (p  = 0.05). all vre isolates were multiresistant and positive for vana gene. twenty  strains of vre and 6 clusters obtained from intensive care unit (icu) are proof of intensive transmission of these microorganisms at this department. the results of this study suggest wide genotypic variability among the clinical vre isolates, but also intrahospital dissemination of some of them.

TI  == incidence of virulence factors in enterococci from raw and fermented meat and biofilm forming capacity at 25 degrees c and 37 degrees c.
AB  == twenty-nine enterococcus strains from raw and fermented meat products were screened for the presence of virulence genes, including those for aggregation substances (asa1 and asa373), cytolysin activator (cyla), collagen binding protein (ace), endocarditis antigen (efaa), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and gelatinase (gele). virulence gene occurrence, expression of gelatinase and pheromone aggregation was greater in enterococcus faecalis than in enterococcus faecium strains. all e. faecalis and 54% of e. faecium were positive for at least one or more virulence gene. the only strain of enterococcus gallinarum tested also contained virulence genes. the effect of different growth temperatures (25 and 37 degrees c) on biofilm formation using polystyrene plates was also assessed. strong biofilm formation occurred at lower than optimum temperature in  all three species of enterococci. neither esp nor gele was necessary for biofilm  formation and this relationship was species rather than strain specific. this study emphasizes the importance of enterococci as a reservoir of virulence genes  and the potential for their genetic transfer to human strains following consumption of uncooked or undercooked contaminated meat.

TI  == genetic characterization of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in enterococcus spp. from japanese retail ready-to-eat raw fish.
AB  == little information is available on the diversity and distribution of resistance and virulence factors in enterococci isolated from retail fish. in this study, 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the japanese prefecture of hiroshima were analyzed for incidence of enterococcus spp. we recovered 96 enterococcal isolates from 90 (45%, 90/200) samples. fifty-six strains were identified at the species level: e. faecalis (n = 31), e. faecium (n = 7), e. casseliflavus (n = 7), e. gallinarum (n = 3), e. phoeniculicola (n = 4), e. raffinosus (n = 2), e. saccharolyticus (n = 1), and e. gilvus (n = 1). twenty-five (26%, 25/96) strains carried antibiotic resistance genes. these included the tet(m), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), msr(a/b), aph(3'), and blaz genes, which were detected in 12.5%, 9.3%, 2%, 14.5%, 1%, 1%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. the virulence genes gele and asa1 were detected in 31 and 24 e. faecalis strains, respectively. both genes were detected in one e. faecium strain. in conclusion, this is the first study to underscore the importance of sashimi as not only a reservoir of enterococcus spp. carrying resistance and virulence genes, but also a reservoir for unusual enterococcus spp.

TI  == neutralization of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by humic acid in vitro.
AB  == in the present study, the neutralization ability of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by different humic acids was investigated. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of glyphosate for different bacteria such as bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis, escherichia coli, e. coli 1917 strain nissle, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium were determined in the presence or absence of different concentrations of humic acid (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg ml(-1)). our findings indicated that humic acids inhibited the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate on different bacteria. this information can help overcome the negative impact of glyphosate residues in feed and water.

TI  == a proposal for source tracking of fecal pollution in recreational waters by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to identify specific river sources of fecal contamination by applying pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) to environmental water samples from a recreational beach in japan. the genotypes of all enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains used as indicators of fecal pollution on the recreational beach and rivers were analyzed by pfge, and the pfge profiles of the strains were classified at a 0.9 similarity level using dendrogram analysis. pfge types of e. faecium isolated from sakai river or urban drainage were classified in the same cluster. therefore, the probable sources of fecal pollution on the recreational beach were sakai river and urban drainage. the approaches for microbial source tracking employed in this study used pfge with enterococcus species as an indicator can be a potential tool to specify the source(s) of fecal pollution and contribute to improved public health in coastal environments.

TI  == [surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization  treatment of the surgical infection. methods: retrospectively analyzed from january 2008 to december 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. results: a total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were p.aeruginosa, k. pneumonia and e.coli etc) and gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were enterococcus,  staphylococcus and coagulase negative staphylococcus). incidence of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. for  the performance of the high level of sensitive to imipenem, amikacin, piperacillin and tazobactam by e. coli and k. pneumonia. the pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with multidrug resistance. no vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant enterococcus faecium were found. the prevalence of esbl e.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and esbl k.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. the methicillin-resistant s.aureus (mrsa) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other gram-positive cocci. vancomycin for staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. conclusions: the main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. the resistant rate shows ascendant trend; drug resistance is significantly higher in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.

TI  == control of the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in hospitals: epidemiology and clinical relevance.
AB  == background: the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), particularly e. faecium, in hospitals leads to many cases of colonization, but only sporadic infections. detailed and valid risk assessment is needed so that patients at risk can be protected from vre infection. the principal aims of risk assessment must include not only lowering vre-associated morbidity and mortality in patients at risk, but also refraining from unnecessary anti-infective measures among those who are not at risk. methods: we selectively searched the pubmed database for pertinent articles on the epidemiology and clinical relevance of vre in order to  derive a uniform and practical hygiene strategy from the available scientific evidence. results: only low-level evidence is available for the interventions studied to date, and most of the recommendations that have been issued can be characterized as expert opinion. as a rule, vre are not highly pathogenic; they tend to have high rates of colonization, but low rates of infection. the risk factors for colonization with vre include (among others) the administration of antibiotics and immunosuppressants, prior hospitalization, diarrhea, intubation,  and other invasive treatments. the areas of highest risk are hematology/oncology  wards, liver transplantation wards, dialysis units, and neonatology wards. conclusion: the chain of infection can be broken by improved and consistently applied standard hygienic measures (hand and surface disinfection). some patients are nonetheless at elevated risk of vre infection. in specific clinical situations, the optimal protection of these patients against vre infection demands the obligatory enforcement of stricter hygienic measures (contact isolation).

TI  == epidemic escherichia coli st131 and enterococcus faecium st17 in coastal marine sediments from an italian beach.
AB  == fecal indicator bacteria (fib) are used worldwide to assess water quality in coastal environments, but little is known about their genetic diversity and pathogenicity. this study examines the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and genetic diversity of fib isolated from marine sediments from a central adriatic seaside resort. fib, recovered from 6 out of 7 sites, were significantly more abundant at sampling stations 300 m offshore than close to the shore. escherichia coli accounted for 34.5% of fecal coliforms, and enterococcus  faecalis accounted for 32% of enterococci. most isolates (27% of e. coli and 22%  of enterococci) were recovered from the sediments that had the highest organic content. multidrug-resistant e. coli (31%) and enterococci (22%) were found at nearly all sites, whereas 34.5% of e. coli and 28% of enterococci harboring multiple virulence factors were recovered from just two sites. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing showed wide genetic diversity among isolates. human epidemic clones ( e. coli st131 and enterococcus faecium st17) were identified for the first time by multilocus sequence typing in an area where bathing had not been prohibited. these clones were from sites far removed from riverine inputs, suggesting a wide diffusion of pathogenic fib in the coastal environment and a high public health risk.

AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == adhesion and virulence factor properties of enterococci isolated from clinical samples in iran.
AB  == introduction: enterococci rank among leading causes of nosocomial bacteremia, urinary tract infections and community acquired endocarditis. the aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of virulence factors in enterococci strains isolated from clinical samples in iranian educational hospitals. methodology: presence of aggregation substance (asa), extracellular surface protein (esp), enterococcus faecalis antigen a (efaa), adhesin of collagen from e. faecalis (ace), endocarditis and biofilm-associated pilli (ebp) as colonization factors and cytolysin (cyl), gelatinase (gel) and hyaloronidase (hyl) as secretary factors were investigated in isolates. a total of 201 clinical isolates of enterococci were collected in 2009-2010 from eight educational hospitals. after deoxyribonucleic acid extraction, they were examined for presence of virulence factors by polymerase chain reaction. results: e. faecalis  and enterococcus faecium were isolated from 56.9% to 43.1%, respectively. resistance to vancomycin and gentamicin were 33.8% and 83.9% in e. faecium isolates and 16.3% and 88.1% in e. faecalis isolates respectively. colonization factors were found to be more prevalent in e. faecalis isolates and almost all isolates of e. faecalis had ace, ebp and efaa genes. esp gene had a higher rate of distribution in enterococci isolates (75.1%) in this study compared with previous studies. one of e. faecalis isolates contained hyl gene, but 38.8% of e. faecium isolates had it. mutual exclusive were present between hyl and efaa in all e. faecium isolates and 69.7% of e. faecium hyl - positive isolates were esp  positive. conclusion: according to these results, virulence genes were more prevalent in e. faecalis isolates and e. faecalis had more potential pathogenesis for initiating an infection; however because of e. faeciums higher antibiotic resistance, we have been facing higher e. faecium infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == nonclinical and clinical enterococcus faecium strains, but not enterococcus faecalis strains, have distinct structural and functional genomic features.
AB  == certain strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis contribute beneficially to animal health and food production, while others are associated with nosocomial infections. to determine whether there are structural and functional genomic features that are distinct between nonclinical (nc) and clinical (cl) strains of those species, we analyzed the genomes of 31 e. faecium  and 38 e. faecalis strains. hierarchical clustering of 7,017 orthologs found in the e. faecium pangenome revealed that nc strains clustered into two clades and are distinct from cl strains. nc e. faecium genomes are significantly smaller than cl genomes, and this difference was partly explained by significantly fewer  mobile genetic elements (me), virulence factors (vf), and antibiotic resistance (ar) genes. e. faecium ortholog comparisons identified 68 and 153 genes that are  enriched for nc and cl strains, respectively. proximity analysis showed that cl-enriched loci, and not nc-enriched loci, are more frequently colocalized on the genome with me. in cl genomes, ar genes are also colocalized with me, and vf  are more frequently associated with cl-enriched loci. genes in 23 functional groups are also differentially enriched between nc and cl e. faecium genomes. in  contrast, differences were not observed between nc and cl e. faecalis genomes despite their having larger genomes than e. faecium. our findings show that unlike e. faecalis, nc and cl e. faecium strains are equipped with distinct structural and functional genomic features indicative of adaptation to different  environments.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == biocide and copper tolerance in enterococci from different sources.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in enterococci is a matter of concern. a collection of 272 strains (including 107 enterococcus faecalis and 165 enterococcus faecium strains) isolated from meat and dairy products, seafood, vegetable foods, wildflowers, animal feces (ewe, goat, horse, mule), and hospitals were tested for sensitivity to biocides of different classes (quaternary ammonium compounds, a bisphenol, and a biguanide) and copper sulfate. most isolates were inhibited at 25 mg of benzalkonium chloride or cetrimide per liter or at 2.5 mg of hexadecylpyridinium chloride per liter. few isolates had mics higher than 25 mg/liter for benzalkonium chloride (2.2%), cetrimide (0.74%), or hexadecylpyridinium chloride (0.37%), although they were all inhibited at 250 mg/liter. the population response to triclosan was very homogeneous, and most isolates (98.16%) were inhibited at 250 mg of triclosan per liter. chlorhexidine  showed the greatest variability, with mics in a range from 2.5 to 2,500 mg/liter. remarkably, 74.57% of isolates from clinical samples required 2,500 mg of chlorhexidine per liter for inhibition, compared to much-lower concentrations required for most isolates from other sources. enterococci were inhibited by copper sulfate in a concentration range from 4 to 16 mm, with no bimodal distribution. however, most isolates required 12 mm (41.91%) or 16 mm (47.43%) for inhibition. the highest percentages of isolates requiring 16 mm cuso4 were from vegetable foods, seafood, and wildflowers. the results from the present study suggest intermediate levels of copper tolerance and a low incidence of biocide tolerance in the enterococci investigated, except for chlorhexidine in clinical isolates.

TI  == [analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in china].
AB  == objective: to investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. methods: the bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in  17 cities. minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 clsi guideline. results: among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for gram negative strains, respectively. the isolating rate of mrsa was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). the mrcns proportions were similar across the 3 periods. one (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis were found. although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates  increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. the results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (iv), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. esbl-harboring strains in e. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. esbl-producing strains in klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. except that the sensitive rate of enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). one strain (1.0%, 1/99) of acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. conclusions: we are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.

TI  == linezolid resistance in enterococcus faecium isolated in ontario, canada.
AB  == recent studies have described linezolid-resistant mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) occurring worldwide, including an outbreak of linezolid-resistant mrsa. the objective of this study was to determine if linezolid-resistant enterococci are present in clinical isolates in ontario, canada. from january 2010 to june 2012, all enterococcal isolates submitted to the public health ontario laboratory (phol) for confirmation of vre and susceptibility testing were included in this study. of 2829 enterococcal isolates tested, 12 enterococcus faecium were found to be resistant to linezolid. all linezolid-resistant isolates were also resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. in addition, 33% of isolates were non-susceptible to daptomycin,  whereas 41% were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin. molecular characterization of these isolates showed that 8/12 isolates (66.7%) contained the mutation g2576t in 23s rrna, which has been associated with linezolid resistance. amplification and sequencing of l3- and l4-coding genes did not reveal mutations associated with linezolid resistance. one isolate contained the  cfr gene, which is associated with linezolid resistance, and has been found in staphylococcal species and e. faecalis. these data show that occurrence of linezolid resistance is still rare among enterococcal isolates referred to phol though detection of cfr in e. faecium is concerning as it has the potential to disseminate among other enterococci.

TI  == a current perspective on daptomycin for the clinical microbiologist.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria that was first approved for clinical use in 2004 in the united states. since this time, significant data have emerged regarding the use of daptomycin for the treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, caused by gram-positive pathogens. however, there are also increasing reports of daptomycin nonsusceptibility, in staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. such nonsusceptibility is largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but it may occur in the absence of prior  daptomycin exposure. nonsusceptibility in both s. aureus and enterococcus is mediated by adaptations to cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism. this review summarizes the data on daptomycin, including daptomycin's unique mode of action and spectrum of activity and mechanisms for nonsusceptibility in key pathogens, including s. aureus, e. faecium, and e. faecalis. the challenges faced by the clinical laboratory in obtaining accurate susceptibility results and reporting daptomycin mics are also discussed.

TI  == [study of a cohort of patients with enterococcus spp. bacteraemia. risk factors associated to high-level resistance to aminoglycosides].
AB  == objectives: to analyze a cohort of patients with enterococcus sp. bacteraemia. patients and methods: retrospective and observational study of a cohort of non-pediatric in-patients with enterococcus spp. bacteraemia (june 2007-september 2009). data collection from clinical records was done according to a standard protocol. we analyzed epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data. treatment with glycopeptides in non allergic patients or in case of betalactam susceptibility (ampicillin) was considered "optimizable". results: three were 106 cases of bacteraemia (2.2/1000 admitted patients; 84% e. faecalis); 83% had an underlying condition; 88% nosocomial or health related cases. urinary infection was present in 20% and primary bacteraemia in 47%. high level resistance to gentamicin (hlrg) was present in 60%; there was no vancomycin or linezolid resistance. most frequent empiric treatments were penicillin-betalactamase inhibitor (25%) and glycopeptides (22%). most frequent definitive treatment was glycopeptides (34%), being "optimized" 21% and 44% of empiric and definitive treatments, respectively. mortality was 23% (related, 14%). in the multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with hlrg were nosocomial acquired infection (or 6.083; 95ci% 1.428-25.915) and no-abdominal origin (or 6.006; 95ci%1.398-25.805). in multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were: pitt > 3 (or 14.405; 95ci%2.236-92.808) and active empiric treatment (or 8.849; 95ci% 1.101-71.429). incidence in previous cohort was similar but hlrg rate has increased. conclusions: risk factors associated with hlrg were nosocomial acquired infection and no-abdominal origin. risk factors for mortality were initial clinical severity and having received active empiric treatment. hlrg rate has increased.

TI  == icesluvan, a 94-kilobase mosaic integrative conjugative element conferring interspecies transfer of vanb-type glycopeptide resistance, a novel bacitracin resistance locus, and a toxin-antitoxin stabilization system.
AB  == a 94-kb integrative conjugative element (icesluvan) transferable to enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different gram-positive bacteria. a variant of icesluvan was confirmed in s. lutetiensis from a patient. a complete tn5382/tn1549 with a vanb2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal icesde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type iv secretion system. moreover, icesluvan encodes a putative mobc family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. a 9-kb element within tn5382/tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the tnpx site-specific recombinase in faecalibacterium and vanz in paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected  low-level teicoplanin resistance. furthermore, icesluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to e. faecium. the expression of a streptococcal pezat toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of icesluvan in s. lutetiensis, e. faecium, and e. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing icesluvan within new hosts. junction pcr and dna sequencing confirmed that icesluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in s. lutetiensis, e. faecalis, and e. faecium. transfer between e. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pip964. sequence analysis of the original s. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that icesluvan integrates in a site-specific  manner into the c-terminal end of the chromosomal trna methyltransferase gene ruma.

TI  == emergence of enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in south korea.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in south korea. methods: medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 january 2004 and 31 july 31 2010  were reviewed. four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. outcome measures were culture-proven  infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in  the patients. results: a total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. the positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). the most common organisms identified were enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %,  6/96), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). two cases of enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. the  most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were e. faecalis and  k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the emergence of e. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of e. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. this increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.

TI  == molecular characterization of rifr mutations in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == mutation rate is an important factor affecting the appearance and spread of acquired antibiotic resistance. the frequencies and types of enterococci mutations were determined in this study. the mics of rifampicin in enterococci and their rifampicin-resistant mutants were determined by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) agar dilution method. the enterococcus faecalis isolates a15 and 18165 showed no significant differences in mutation frequencies or mutation rates. in enterococcus faecium, the mutation frequency and mutation rate were both 6.4-fold lower than in e. faecalis. the spectrum of mutations characterized in e. faecium b42 differed significantly from that of e.  faecalis. the types and rate of mutations indicated that e. faecalis had a higher potential to develop linezolid resistance. rifampicin resistance was associated with mutations in the rpob gene. rifampicin mics for the e. faecalis mutant were  2048 mg/l, but rifampicin mics for e. faecium mutants ranged from 64 to 1024 mg/l.

TI  == increase in bloodstream infection due to vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium in cancer patients: risk factors, molecular epidemiology and outcomes.
AB  == we conducted a prospective study to assess the risk factors, molecular epidemiology and outcome of bloodstream infection (bsi) due to enterococcus faecium in hospitalized cancer patients. between 2006 and 2012, a significant increase in vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium bsi was observed among cancer patients. comparison of 54 episodes of bsi due to e. faecium with 38 episodes of  bsi due to e. faecalis showed that previous use of carbapenems was the only independent risk factor for e. faecium acquisition (or 10.24; 95% ci, 1.35-77.66). all e. faecium isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides, whereas 97% showed high-level resistance to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. all 30 isolates available for genotyping belonged to the hospital-associated e. faecium lineages  17, 18 and 78. after 2009, most of the isolates belonged to st117 (lineage 78). patients with e. faecium bsi were more likely to receive inadequate initial empirical antibiotic therapy than patients with e. faecalis bsi, and time to adequate empirical antibiotic therapy was also longer in the former group. no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding early and overall case-fatality rates. independent risk factors for overall case-fatality were current corticosteroids (or 4.18; 95% ci, 1.34-13.01) and intensive care unit admission (or 9.97; 95% ci, 1.96-50.63). the emergence of e. faecium among cancer patients is a concern since there are limited treatment options and it may presage the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. a rationale approach that combines infection control with antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == technological characterisation, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of wild-type leuconostoc strains isolated from north italian traditional cheeses.
AB  == genotypic and technological properties, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of 35 leuconostoc strains, isolated from different italian raw milk cheeses, were investigated. rapd-pcr was used to study genetic variability and to distinguish closely related strains. the results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among isolates. all the strains had weak acidifying activity and showed low proteolytic and lipolytic activities. reduction activity, was generally low. all the leuconostoc were susceptible to ampicillin, mupirocin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tetracycline. many strains were classified as resistant to oxacillin, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantonin, while all isolates were found resistant to vancomycin. pcr-based detection did not identify any of the common genetic determinants for vancomycin (vana, vanb, vanc1, vanc2, vanc3, vand, vane, vang) or erythromycin (ermb and ermc). tetracycline resistance genes were detected in 25 tetracycline susceptible strains, the most frequent one being tetm. one strain, belonging to ln. pseudomesenteroides species, was positive for the presence of the int gene of the tn916/tn1545 trasposon family. this is the first time the conjugative transposon  tn916 has been detected inside the leuconostoc species. all strains showed antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium. the presence of genes encoding amino-acid decarboxylases (hdc and tdc) was not detected. some strains are interesting in view of their use in cheese production  as starter and non starter cultures.

TI  == dissemination of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli from wild birds of azores archipelago.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant is profoundly important to human and animal health, but the  environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood, in particular in wild environments in remote archipelagos. moreover, the prevalence  of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bird populations is rather unknown. in the present study, we used the azores islands as a model study for antimicrobial  resistance in a remote archipelago, and examined the antibiotic resistance profile in enterococci and escherichia coli recovered from faecal samples of wild birds collected in this archipelago. a total of 138 enterococci and 115 e. coli isolates were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (59 isolates), followed by enterococcus faecium (40 isolates), enterococcus durans (27 isolates) and enterococcus hirae (12 isolates). the enterococci strains showed high percentages of resistance to tetracycline (32.6%), to ciprofloxacin (19.6%) and to erythromycin (11.6%). lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, chloramphenicol and teicoplanin. one vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolate was detected and harbored the vana resistant gene. resistance genes detected included tet(m) and/or tet(l), ermb in  all tetracycline and erythromycin-resistant isolates. resistance in e. coli isolates was detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, and tobramycin. the blatem, aada, aada5, stra, strb, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the inti genes were found in all ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates respectively. the data shown in  this study are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild birds from remote archipelagos such as the azores  archipelago and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. to gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of portuguese ready-to-eat salads (rts) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. a total of 50 rts (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in porto region (2010). they were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. the e. coli, other coliforms and enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and  clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. a high number of rts presented  poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--e. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. in addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds  (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. e. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups a, b1 and d; none stec) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(a) and/or tet(b)], streptomycin (58%; aada and/or stra-strb), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfra1 or dfra12), ampicillin (49%; blatem), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; cata). e. coli clones, including the widespread group d/st69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(shv-2) and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrb9 gene. among enterococcus (n=108;  35 samples; enterococcus casseliflavus--40, enterococcus faecalis--20, enterococcus faecium--18, enterococcus hirae--9, enterococcus gallinarum--5, and  enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(m) and/or tet(l)], erythromycin [3%; erm(b)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). the present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. e. coli-d-st69; bla(shv-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.

TI  == development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == a selective and differential medium termed 'lg agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of lactococcus garvieae that results in  black colonies with red halos. in this study, all 14 strains of l. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the  lg agar. the nine viable strains on lg agar plates (including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio furnissii, vibrio mimicus and vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from l. garvieae by various colours or colony features. colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using lg agar plates were all positively identified as l. garvieae by conventional tests and 16s rdna sequencing. furthermore, lg agar discriminated capsulated strains of l. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. the specificity and differentiating ability of lg agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of l. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of fosfomycin-based combinations against clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococci (vre) are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens, commonly causing catheter-related urinary tract infections or vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections. in this study, 10 enterococcus faecium and 9 enterococcus faecalis different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genome-type vr clinical isolates were detected. the potential role of fosfomycin-based combination regimens for biofilm-related vre infection is in vitro evaluated. anti-vre activities of fosfomycin, ampicillin, linezolid, minocycline, rifampicin, tigecycline, teicoplanin, vancomycin alone, or fosfomycin-based combinations were studied by time-kill method and a biofilm model. of the fosfomycin-based combinations, a synergistic effect was particularly noted for teicoplanin against 89% of the vr e. faecalis isolates. in a biofilm model, only linezolid alone was able to reduce the bacterial loads, and the use of fosfomycin-based combinations, excluding rifampicin (40%), failed to enhance antibacterial activity against vr e. faecium. for e. faecalis, an inhibitory effect was evident using ampicillin alone or fosfomycin plus rifampicin (100%), tigecycline (56%), or teicoplanin (44%). however, an antagonistic effect was found for ampicillin plus fosfomycin against 2 of 3 of the vr e. faecalis isolates. the antibacterial activities of the drugs tested against vre in vitro varied by species. ampicillin exhibited potential activity against planktonic- and biofilm-embedded vr e. faecalis. fosfomycin-based combinations may have enhanced antibacterial effects against vre even in the biofilm model, and this observation warrants further clinical studies.

TI  == diversity, distribution and antibiotic resistance of enterococcus spp. recovered  from tomatoes, leaves, water and soil on u.s. mid-atlantic farms.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. however, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. we evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the mid-atlantic united states. tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was  performed using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. enterococcus faecalis  isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. enterococci (n = 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. seven species were identified: enterococcus  casseliflavus, e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avis, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus raffinosus. e. casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and e. faecalis predominated in pond water. on plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. e. faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.

AB  == background/objectives: enterococci, though commensals in adult feces are important nosocomial pathogens. the most common nosocomial infection caused by these organisms is urinary tract infection. objectives: (1) to isolate and speciate enterococci from cases of urinary tract infection. (2) to know antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates. (3) to determine high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) among the isolates. methods: identification and  speciation of the isolates were done by the standard conventional methods. antibacterial susceptibility pattern was determined by standard disc diffusion method and hlar by using gentamicin (120 mug) and streptomycin (300 mug) discs. results: a total of 150 strains of enterococci were isolated from a total of 2520 urine samples. out of 150 strains, 95 (63.3%) were enterococcus faecalis, 55 (36.7%) were e. faecium. a total of 102 (68%) isolates showed high level resistance to gentamicin and/or streptomycin by high content disc diffusion. conclusion: antibiotic sensitivity pattern revealed presence of multidrug resistance in e. faecium as well as e. faecalis and resistance among e. faecium isolates was higher than e. faecalis. hlar among enterococcal isolates was high in our institute.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == american crows as carriers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci with vana gene.
AB  == we studied the vana-carrying vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated from american crows in the united states during the winter 2011/2012. faecal samples from crows were cultured selectively for vre and characterized. pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) were used to examine epidemiological relationships of vana-containing vre. isolates were tested in vitro for their ability to horizontally transfer the vancomycin resistance trait. vre with the vana gene were found in 15 (2.5%) of 590 crows samples, from which we obtained 22 different isolates. enterococcal species were enterococcus faecium (14) and e. faecalis (8). one, two and 19 isolates originated from kansas, new york state and massachusetts, respectively. based on mlst analysis, e. faecium isolates were grouped as st18 (6 isolates), st555 (2), and novel types st749 (1), st750 (3), st751 (1), st752 (1). enterococcus faecalis isolates belonged to st6 (1), st16 (3) and st179 (4). all isolates were able to transfer the vancomycin resistance trait via filter mating with very high transfer range. clinically important enterococci with the vana gene occur in faeces of wild american crows throughout the united states. these migrating birds may contribute to the dissemination of vre in environment over large distances. [correction added after first online publication on 06 august 2013: the number of e. faecium st752 isolate is now amended to '1', consistent with that shown in the 'results' section and figure 2.].

TI  == trag encoded by the pip501 type iv secretion system is a two-domain peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme essential for conjugative transfer.
AB  == pip501 is a conjugative broad-host-range plasmid frequently present in nosocomial enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. we focus here on the functional analysis of the type iv secretion gene trag, which was found to be essential for pip501 conjugative transfer between gram-positive bacteria. the trag protein, which localizes to the cell envelope of e. faecalis harboring pip501, was expressed and purified without its n-terminal transmembrane helix (tragdeltatmh) and shown to possess peptidoglycan-degrading activity. tragdeltatmh was inhibited by specific lytic transglycosylase inhibitors hexa-n-acetylchitohexaose and bulgecin a. analysis of the trag sequence suggested the presence of two domains which both could contribute to the observed cell wall-degrading activity: an n-terminal soluble lytic transglycosylase domain (slt) and a c-terminal cysteine-, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases  (chap) domain. the protein domains were expressed separately, and both degraded peptidoglycan. a change of the conserved glutamate residue in the putative catalytic center of the slt domain (e87) to glycine resulted in almost complete inactivity, which is consistent with this part of trag being a predicted lytic transglycosylase. based on our findings, we propose that trag locally opens the peptidoglycan to facilitate insertion of the gram-positive bacterial type iv secretion machinery into the cell envelope.

TI  == presence of virulence factors in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium susceptible and resistant to vancomycin.
AB  == despite the increasing importance of enterococcus as opportunistic pathogens, their virulence factors are still poorly understood. this study determines the frequency of virulence factors in clinical and commensal enterococcus isolates from inpatients in porto alegre, brazil. fifty enterococcus isolates were analysed and the presence of the gele, asa1 and esp genes was determined. gelatinase activity and biofilm formation were also tested. the clonal relationships among the isolates were evaluated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the asa1, gele and esp genes were identified in 38%, 60% and 76% of all isolates, respectively. the first two genes were more prevalent in enterococcus faecalis than in enterococcus faecium, as was biofilm formation, which was associated with gele and asa1 genes, but not with the esp gene. the presence of gele and the activity of gelatinase were not fully concordant. no relationship was observed among any virulence factors and specific subclones of e. faecalis or e. faecium resistant to vancomycin. in conclusion, e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates showed significantly different patterns of virulence determinants. neither the source of isolation nor the clonal relationship or vancomycin resistance influenced their distribution.

TI  == linezolid-resistant clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococcus cohnii from a multicentre study in china: molecular epidemiology and resistance mechanisms.
AB  == genetic characterisation of linezolid-resistant gram-positive cocci in a multicentre study in china has not been reported previously. to study the mechanism underlying the resistance of linezolid-resistant isolates, nine enterococcus faecalis, one enterococcus faecium and three staphylococcus cohnii isolates with various levels of resistance were collected from five hospitals across china in 2009-2012. the nine e. faecalis isolates were classified into seven sequence types, indicating that these linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates were polyclonal. enterococci isolates had reduced susceptibility to linezolid (mics of 4-8 mg/l) and had mutation of ribosomal protein l3, with three also having mutation of l4, but without the multidrug resistance gene cfr or the  23s rrna mutation g2576t. the three s. cohnii isolates were highly resistant to linezolid (mics of 64 mg/l to >256 mg/l), harboured the cfr gene and had the 23s  rrna mutation g2576t. southern blotting indicated that the cfr gene of these three isolates resided on different plasmids (phk01, prm01 and pra01). in plasmid phk01, is21-558 and the cfr gene were integrated into transposon tn558. in plasmids prm01 and pra01, the cfr gene was flanked by two copies of an is256-like insertion sequence, indicating that the transferable form of linezolid resistance is conferred by the cfr gene. in conclusion, the emergence of linezolid-resistant gram-positive cocci in different regions of china is of concern. the cfr gene and the 23s rrna mutation contribute to high-level linezolid resistance in s. cohnii, and the l3 and l4 mutations are associated with low-level linezolid resistance in enterococci.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == spread of multidrug-resistant enterococcus to animals and humans: an underestimated role for the pig farm environment.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to discover the potential role of the pig farm environment in the spread of multidrug-resistant (mdr) enterococcus strains, including high-risk clones, to animals and humans. methods: enterococcus isolates were recovered from a variety of samples (n = 82; swine, feed/medicines/antiseptics and pig farm facilities) from six portuguese farms, most using antibiotics. antimicrobial susceptibility/conjugation assays were performed by standard procedures, bacterial identification/screening of antibiotic resistance genes were performed by pcr and clonality was determined using pfge/multilocus sequence typing. results: enterococcus isolates resistant to antibiotics (n= 473) were recovered from samples of different origin (swine, feed/antiseptics, animal residues and pig farm facilities), but only the clinically relevant species enterococcus faecium (n = 171) and enterococcus faecalis (n = 78) were included for further comprehensive molecular analysis. isolates resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, erythromycin and aminoglycosides were better recovered in slanetz-bartley medium with these antibiotics present than in media not supplemented with antibiotics (p < 0.05). e. faecium was more frequently resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin and e. faecalis to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol or aminoglycosides (p < 0.05). glycopeptide and erythromycin resistance rates were similar in both species. the transfer of resistance to several antibiotics, including vancomycin and ampicillin, was demonstrated. clones associated with human infections were detected in different samples from the same farm [e. faecium from sequence type (st) 78 lineage and e. faecalis st16; manure, waste lagoons, faeces and drinking water] and in geographically distant farms [e. faecium clonal complex (cc) 5; e. faecalis cc21 and st16]. conclusions: the pig farm environment has an underestimated potential role in the transmission of mdr  enterococcus to animals and, possibly, to humans. the continuous contact of swine with mdr enterococcus by different routes (e.g. feed, dust, air and rooms) might  decrease the impact of restrictive antibiotic use policies and reinforces the need for different and preliminary interventions at the husbandry management level.

TI  == multiplex identification of gram-positive bacteria and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths: evaluation of an automated microarray-based nucleic acid test.
AB  == background: a multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the verigene gram-positive blood culture test (bc-gp) test to identify 12 gram-positive bacterial gene targets and three genetic resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths containing gram-positive bacteria. methods and findings: 1,252 blood cultures containing gram-positive bacteria were prospectively collected and tested at five clinical centers between april, 2011 and january, 2012. an additional 387 contrived blood cultures containing uncommon targets (e.g., listeria spp., s. lugdunensis, vanb-positive enterococci) were included to fully evaluate the performance of the bc-gp test. sensitivity and specificity for the 12 specific genus or species targets identified by the bc-gp test ranged from 92.6%-100% and  95.4%-100%, respectively. identification of the meca gene in 599 cultures containing s. aureus or s. epidermidis was 98.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific compared to cefoxitin disk method. identification of the vana gene in 81 cultures containing enterococcus faecium or e. faecalis was 100% sensitive and specific. approximately 7.5% (87/1,157) of single-organism cultures contained gram-positive bacteria not present on the bc-gp test panel. in 95 cultures containing multiple  organisms the bc-gp test was in 71.6% (68/95) agreement with culture results. retrospective analysis of 107 separate blood cultures demonstrated that identification of methicillin resistant s. aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. was completed an average of 41.8 to 42.4 h earlier using the bc-gp test compared to routine culture methods. the bc-gp test was unable to assign meca to a specific organism in cultures containing more than one staphylococcus isolate and does not identify common blood culture contaminants such as micrococcus, corynebacterium, and bacillus. conclusions: the bc-gp test is a multiplex test capable of detecting most leading causes of gram-positive bacterial blood stream infections as well as genetic markers of methicillin and vancomycin resistance directly from positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparison of enterococcus species diversity in marine water and wastewater using enterolert and epa method 1600.
AB  == epa method 1600 and enterolert are used interchangeably to measure enterococcus for fecal contamination of public beaches, but the methods occasionally produce different results. here we assess whether these differences are attributable to the selectivity for certain species within the enterococcus group. both methods were used to obtain 1279 isolates from 17 environmental samples, including influent and effluent of four wastewater treatment plants, ambient marine water from seven different beaches, and freshwater urban runoff from two stream systems. the isolates were identified to species level. detection of non-enterococcus species was slightly higher using enterolert (8.4%) than for epa method 1600 (5.1%). e. faecalis and e. faecium, commonly associated with human fecal waste, were predominant in wastewater; however, enterolert had greater selectivity for e. faecalis, which was also shown using a laboratory-created sample. the same species selectivity was not observed for most beach water and urban runoff samples. these samples had relatively higher proportions of plant associated species, e. casseliflavus (18.5%) and e. mundtii (5.7%), compared to wastewater, suggesting environmental inputs to beaches and runoff. the potential  for species selectivity among water testing methods should be considered when assessing the sanitary quality of beaches so that public health warnings are based on indicators representative of fecal sources.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
AB  == background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated  against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results:  among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p.  aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.

TI  == genetic basis for in vitro and in vivo resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins (lsap phenotype) in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == as opposed to enterococcus faecalis, which is intrinsically resistant to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins (lsap phenotype) by production of the abc protein lsa(a), enterococcus faecium is naturally susceptible. since this phenotype may be selected for in vivo by quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of acquired lsap resistance in e. faecium. six lsap-resistant in vitro mutants of e. faecium hm1070 as well as three different pairs of clinical isolates (pre- and postexposure to q-d) were studied. the full genome sequence of an in vitro mutant (e. faecium ucn90b) was determined by using 454 sequencing technology and was compared with that of the parental strain. single-nucleotide replacement was carried out to confirm the role of this mutation. by comparative genomic analysis, a point mutation was found within a 1,503-bp gene coding for an abc homologue showing 66% amino acid identity with lsa(a). this mutation (c1349t) led to an amino acid substitution (thr450ile). an identical mutation was identified in all in vitro and in vivo resistant strains but was not present in susceptible  strains. the wild-type allele was named eat(a) (for enterococcus abc transporter), and its mutated allelic variant was named eat(a)v. the introduction of eat(a)v from ucn90b into hm1070 conferred the lsap phenotype, whereas that of  eat(a) from hm1070 into ucn90b restored susceptibility entirely. this is the first description of the molecular mechanism of acquired lsap resistance in e. faecium. characterization of the biochemical mechanism of resistance and the physiological role of this abc protein need further investigations.

TI  == fitness costs of various mobile genetic elements in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == objectives: to determine the fitness effects of various mobile genetic elements (mges) in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis when newly acquired. we  also tested the hypothesis that the biological cost of vancomycin resistance plasmids could be mitigated during continuous growth in the laboratory. methods:  different mges, including two conjugative transposons (ctns) of the tn916 family  (18 and 33 kb), a pathogenicity island (pai) of 200 kb and vancomycin-resistance  (vana) plasmids (80-200 kb) of various origins and classes, were transferred into common ancestral e. faecium and e. faecalis strains by conjugation assays and experimentally evolved (vana plasmids only). transconjugants were characterized by pfge, s1 nuclease assays and southern blotting hybridization analyses. single  specific primer pcr was performed to determine the target sites for the insertion of the ctns. the fitness costs of various mges in e. faecium and e. faecalis were estimated in head-to-head competition experiments, and evolved populations were generated in serial transfer assays. results: the biological cost of a newly acquired pai and two ctns were both host- and insertion-locus-dependent. newly acquired vana plasmids may severely reduce host fitness (25%-27%), but these costs were rapidly mitigated after only 400 generations of continuous growth in the absence of antibiotic selection. conclusions: newly acquired mges may impose  an immediate biological cost in e. faecium. however, as demonstrated for vana plasmids, the initial costs of mge carriage may be mitigated during growth and beneficial plasmid-host association can rapidly emerge.

AB  == little is known on the genetic relatedness and potential dissemination of particular enterococcal clones in malaysia. we studied the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis and subjected them to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). e. faecium and e. faecalis displayed 27 and 30 pulsotypes, respectively, and 10 representative e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates (five each) yielded few different sequence types (sts): st17 (2 isolates), st78, st203, and st601 for e. faecium, and st6, st16, st28, st179, and st399 for e. faecalis.  resistance to tazobactam-piperacillin and ampicillin amongst e. faecium isolates  was highly observed as compared to e. faecalis isolates. all of the isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the presence of epidemic and nosocomial  strains of selected e. faecium sts: 17, 78, and 203 and e. faecalis st6 as well as high rates of resistance to multiple antibiotics amongst e. faecium isolates is of a particular concern.

TI  == lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

TI  == resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. patients and methods: an analysis of the microbiological results from five european observational studies (july 2006 to october 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cssti and ciai is presented. results:  in total, 213 cssti and 623 ciai patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. at baseline, at least  one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cssti and 464 (74.5%) ciai patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. in cssti, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in ciai most infections were due to e. coli (41.8%),  enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with e. coli in both ciai and cssti. in cssti patients, the clinical response rate to s. aureus was 80.8%. for ciai, 77.4% of e. faecium and 79.5% of e. faecalis patients responded to treatment. conclusions: tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cssti and ciai, including the critically ill, across europe.

TI  == efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in real-life clinical practice from five european observational studies.
AB  == objectives: tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais). the efficacy of tigecycline when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials in the treatment of ciais in routine clinical practice is described. patients and methods: individual patient-level data were pooled from five european observational studies (july 2006 to october 2011). results: a total of 785 ciai patients who received tigecycline were included (mean age 63.1 +/- 14.0 years). of these, 56.6% were in intensive care units, 65.6% acquired their infection in hospital, 88.1% had at least one comorbidity and 65.7% had secondary peritonitis. the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii and sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) scores at the beginning of treatment were 16.9 +/- 7.6 (n = 614) and 7.0 +/- 4.2 (n = 108), respectively, indicating high disease severity. escherichia coli (41.8%), enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (21.1%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens; 49.1%  of infections were polymicrobial and 17.5% were due to resistant pathogens. overall, 54.8% (n = 430) received tigecycline as monotherapy and 45.2% (n = 355)  as combination therapy for a mean duration of 10.6 days. clinical response rates  at the end of treatment were 77.4% for all patients (567/733), 80.6% for patients who received tigecycline as monotherapy (329/408), 75.2% for patients with a nosocomial infection (354/471), 75.8% for patients with an apache ii score >15 (250/330) and 54.2% (32/59) for patients with a sofa score >/= 7. conclusions: in these real-life studies, tigecycline, alone and in combination, achieved favourable clinical response rates in patients with ciai with a high severity of  illness.

AB  == enterococci are among the leading pathogens isolated in hospital-acquired infections. current antimicrobial options for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are limited. prior data suggest that daptomycin at >6 mg/kg of body weight/day may be used to treat enterococcal infections. we retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of high-dose daptomycin (hd-daptomycin) therapy (>6 mg/kg) in a multicenter cohort of adult patients with enterococcal infections to describe the characteristics and outcomes. two hundred forty-five patients were evaluated. enterococcus faecium was identified in 175 (71%), followed by enterococcus faecalis in 49 (20%) and enterococcus spp. in 21 (9%); overall, 204 (83%) isolates were vre. enterococcal infections included bacteremia (173, 71%) and intra-abdominal (35, 14%) and bone and joint (25, 10%) infections. the median dosage and duration of hd-daptomycin were 8.2 mg/kg/day (interquartile range [iqr], 7.7 to 9.7) and 10 days (iqr, 6 to 15), respectively. the overall clinical success rate was 89% (193/218), and microbiological eradication was observed in 93% (177/191) of patients. the median time to clearance of blood cultures on hd-daptomycin was 3 days (iqr, 2 to 5). the 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 27%, and 5 (2%) patients developed daptomycin-nonsusceptible enterococcal strains while on hd-daptomycin. seven patients (3%) had creatine phosphokinase (cpk) elevation, yet no hd-daptomycin regimen was discontinued due  to an elevated cpk and all patients were asymptomatic. overall, there was a high  frequency of clinical success and microbiological eradication in patients treated with hd-daptomycin for enterococcal infections, even in patients with complicated and difficult-to-treat infections. no adverse event-related discontinuation of hd-daptomycin was noted. hd-daptomycin may be an option for the treatment of enterococcal infections.

TI  == drug resistance & virulence determinants in clinical isolates of enterococcus species.
AB  == background & objectives: enterococci are the leading cause of nosocomial infections, and are thus a persisting clinical problem globally. we undertook this study to determine the virulence factors and the antibiotic resistance in enterococcus clinical isolates. methods: one hundred and fifty enterococcus isolates obtained from various clinical specimens were speciated biochemically and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. resistance to vancomycin was determined by using agar screen method. haemolysin and gelatinase productions were detected using 5 per cent sheep blood agar and 12 per cent gelatin agar, respectively. results: among the 150 enterococcus isolates, 84 (56%) were e. faecalis. 51(34%) e. faecium, and 15  (10%) were other enterococcus spp. haemolysin production was seen among 123 (82%) isolates while 61 (40.6%) isolates produced gelatinase. nearly 50 per cent of the isolates showed high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar). a total of 13 (8.6%) isolates showed vancomycin resistance, of which 11(7.3%) had an mic >8 mug/ml. interpretation & conclusions: presence of vre was found to be low among the isolates studied. however, occurrence of vre along with hlar calls for regular detection of vancomycin resistance promptly and accurately to recognize vre colonization and infection. early detection of vre and hlar along with their virulence trait will help in preventing the establishment and spread of multidrug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  == technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. in relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  paracasei and 52% of the enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. related to safety aspects, e. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, l. sakei strains were the most sensitive. in relation to virulence factors, in the e. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaa gene was detected. the analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most e. faecium strains and l. sakei al-142 produced tyramine. in conclusion, l. paracasei al-128 and l. sakei al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.

TI  == susceptibility of enterococci to daptomycin is dependent upon testing methodology.
AB  == an increase in daptomycin nonsusceptible enterococci (dnse) was noted in our institution (8.3% 2008 to 34.5% 2011) using microscan methods which may overestimate dnse prevalence. dnse (n = 150) from the clinical laboratory (2008-2011) underwent susceptibility testing using broth microdilution (bmd), etest, sensititire, microscan prompt (msp), and microscan turbidity (mst) with only 20% of isolates confirmed as nonsusceptible. categorical and essential agreement were highest with msp and mst, but both missed the majority of resistant isolates (70% and 87% missed). etest mic values were statistically higher, more likely to be nonsusceptible, had the lowest very major error rate (37%), and the highest falsely nonsusceptible rate (22%). sensititre mic values were not statistically different from bmd, but missed 57% of dnse. pfge analysis  did not define a clonal outbreak. these findings suggest that microscan methods overestimate nonsusceptibility, and the lack of correlation between methods raises questions regarding which method is most effective at confirming nonsusceptibility.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. in this study, we examine susceptibility among gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. a total of 9,422 gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from europe and north america. one-third of staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. all s. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (p < 0.0001 for both). streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in asia-pacific rim (38%). penicillin resistance occurred  in one-fifth of all s. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in africa to 65% in europe. streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and  vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (p < 0.001). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally  (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in test 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around kampala, uganda.
AB  == background: identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. however, such data from sub-saharan africa is scarce. here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in kampala,  uganda. due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. methodology/principal findings: ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). fifty eight (60%) gram-positive isolates namely staphylococci (21), enterococci (16), streptococci (13), lactococci (5), micrococci (2) and arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely escherichia coli (12), klebsiella oxytoca (5), proteus vulgaris (2), serratia (2), citrobacter (1), cedecea (1) and leclercia (1) were identified. from humans, 24 gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were staphylococci (35%) including four staphylococcus aureus. upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans.  however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not detected. furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant cons were detected in cows (staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (staphylococcus scuiri). also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. however, multidrug resistant klebsiella, proteus, serratia, cedecea, and citrobacter were detected.  lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. interestingly, human and bovine staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-cc435, spa-type t645 corresponding to st121) but with different susceptibility patterns. conclusions/significance: cons, enterococci, streptococci, and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in kampala, uganda. multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. while similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.

TI  == genetic variability of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates from humans, chickens, and pigs in malaysia.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have been reported to be present in humans, chickens, and pigs in malaysia. in the present study, representative samples of vre isolated from these populations were examined for similarities and differences by using the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) method. housekeeping genes of enterococcus faecium (n = 14) and enterococcus faecalis (n = 11) isolates were sequenced and analyzed using the mlst databases eburst and goeburst. we found five sequence types (sts) of e. faecium and six sts of e. faecalis existing in malaysia. enterococcus faecium isolates belonging to st203,  st17, st55, st79, and st29 were identified, and e. faecium st203 was the most common among humans. the mlst profiles of e. faecium from humans in this study were similar to the globally reported nosocomial-related strain lineage belonging to clonal complex 17 (cc17). isolates from chickens and pigs have few similarities to those from humans, except for one isolate from a chicken, which was identified as st203. e. faecalis isolates were more diverse and were identified as st4, st6, st87, st108, st274, and st244, which were grouped as specific to the three hosts. e. faecalis, belonging to the high-risk cc2 and cc87, were detected among isolates from humans. in conclusion, even though one isolate from a chicken was found clonal to that of humans, the mlst analysis of e. faecium and e. faecalis supports the findings of others who suggest vre to be  predominantly host specific and that clinically important strains are found mainly among humans. the infrequent detection of a human vre clone in a chicken may in fact suggest a reverse transmission of vre from humans to animals.

TI  == analysis of the tolerance of pathogenic enterococci and staphylococcus aureus to  cell wall active antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: tolerance refers to the phenomenon that bacteria do not significantly die when exposed to bactericidal antibiotics. enterococci are known for their high tolerance to these drugs, but the molecular reasons why they resist killing  are not understood. in a previous study we showed that the superoxide dismutase (sod) is implicated in this tolerance. this conclusion was based on the results obtained with one particular strain of enterococcus faecalis and therefore the objective of the present communication was to analyse whether dependence of tolerance on active sod is a general phenomenon for enterococci and another gram-positive pathogen, staphylococcus aureus. methods: mutants deficient in sod  activity were constructed in pathogenic enterococci. the wild-type soda gene was  cloned into an expression vector and transformed into sod-deficient strains for complementation with varying levels of sod activity. previously constructed sod-deficient strains of s. aureus were also included in this study. tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin was then tested. results: we demonstrated that the dependence on sod of tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin is a common trait of  antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic enterococci. by varying the levels of expression we could also show that tolerance to vancomycin is directly correlated to sod activity. interestingly, deletion of the soda gene in a non-tolerant enterococcus faecium strain did not further sensitize the mutant to bactericidal  antibiotics. finally, we showed that the sod enzymes of s. aureus are also implicated in tolerance to vancomycin. conclusion: high tolerance of enterococci  to cell wall active antibiotics can be reversed by sod deficiency.

TI  == incidence, clinical characteristics and 30-day mortality of enterococcal bacteraemia in denmark 2006-2009: a population-based cohort study.
AB  == enterococci currently account for approximately 10% of all bacteraemias, reflecting remarkable changes in their epidemiology. however, population-based data of enterococcal bacteraemia are scarce. a population-based cohort study comprised all patients with a first episode of enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium bacteraemia in two danish regions during 2006-2009. we used  data collected prospectively during clinical microbiological counselling and hospital registry data. we determined the incidence of mono- and polymicrobial bacteraemia and assessed clinical and microbiological characteristics as predictors of 30-day mortality in monomicrobial bacteraemia by logistic regression analysis. we identified 1145 bacteraemic patients, 700 (61%) of whom had monomicrobial bacteraemia. the incidence was 19.6/100 000 person-years (13.0/100 000 person-years for e. faecalis and 6.6/100 000 person-years for e. faecium). the majority of bacteraemias were hospital-acquired (e. faecalis, 45.7%; e. faecium, 85.2%). urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections were the  predominant foci for the two species, respectively. infective endocarditis (ie) accounted for 25% of patients with community-acquired e. faecalis bacteraemia. thirty-day mortality was 21.4% in patients with e. faecalis and 34.6% in patients with e. faecium. predictors of 30-day mortality included age, co-morbidity and hospital-acquired bacteraemia. in addition, intra-abdominal infection, unknown focus and high-level gentamicin resistance were predictors of mortality in e. faecalis patients. e. faecium was associated with increased risk of mortality compared with e. faecalis. the study emphasizes the importance of enterococci both in terms of incidence and prognosis. the frequency of ie in patients with e. faecalis bacteraemia emphasizes the importance of echocardiography, especially in community-acquired cases.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == antibiotic resistant enterococci-tales of a drug resistance gene trafficker.
AB  == enterococci have been recognized as important hospital-acquired pathogens in recent years, and isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium are the third- to fourth-most prevalent nosocomial pathogen worldwide. acquired resistances, especially against penicilin/ampicillin, aminoglycosides (high-level) and glycopeptides are therapeutically important and reported in increasing numbers. on the other hand, isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium are commensals of the intestines of humans, many vertebrate and invertebrate animals and may also constitute an active part of the plant flora. certain enterococcal isolates are used as starter cultures or supplements in food fermentation and food preservation. due to their preferred intestinal habitat, their wide occurrence, robustness and ease of cultivation, enterococci are used as indicators for fecal  pollution assessing hygiene standards for fresh- and bathing water and they serve as important key indicator bacteria for various veterinary and human resistance surveillance systems. enterococci are widely prevalent and genetically capable of acquiring, conserving and disseminating genetic traits including resistance determinants among enterococci and related gram-positive bacteria. in the present review we aimed at summarizing recent advances in the current understanding of the population biology of enterococci, the role mobile genetic elements including plasmids play in shaping the population structure and spreading resistance. we explain how these elements could be classified and discuss mechanisms of plasmid  transfer and regulation and the role and cross-talk of enterococcal isolates from food and food animals to humans.

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. the current study examined the activity of tigecycline and  comparators against isolates collected across eastern europe between 2004 and 2010. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution methodologies. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using clsi interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. this study included 10 295 gram-negative and 4611 gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported among 15.3% of escherichia coli and 39.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in turkey (30.9%) and bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. imipenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were identified only in turkey. esbl-positive e. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). most antimicrobials showed poor activity against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of enterococcus faecium isolates. high rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against e. faecium. one-quarter of staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), with the highest rate in romania (51.5%); all mrsa were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. antimicrobial resistance is high in much of eastern europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from eastern europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == thirty fecal samples from wild specimens of iberian lynx were collected and analyzed for enterococcus spp. (27 isolates) and escherichia coli (18 isolates) recovery. the 45 isolates obtained were tested for antimicrobial resistance, molecular mechanisms of resistance, and presence of virulence genes. among the enterococci, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus hirae were the most prevalent  species (11 isolates each), followed by enterococcus faecalis (5 isolates). high  percentages of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin (33% and 30%, respectively) were detected among enterococcal isolates. the tet(m) and/or tet(l), erm(b), aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia, ant(6)-ia, or aph(3')-iiia genes were detected among resistant enterococci. virulence genes were detected in one e. faecalis isolate (cpd, cylb, and cyll) and one e. hirae isolate (cyll). high percentages of resistance were detected in e. coli isolates to tetracycline (33%), streptomycin (28%), nalidixic acid (28%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt, 22%). additionally, the blatem, tet(a), aada, cmla, and different combinations of sul genes were detected among most ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and sxt-resistant isolates, respectively. two isolates contained a class 1 integron with the gene cassette arrays dfra1 + aada1 and dfra12 + aada2. the e. coli isolates were ascribed to phylo-groups a (n=5); b1 (n=4); b2 (n=6), and d (n=3), with the virulence gene fima present in all e. coli isolates. this study found resistance  genes in wild specimens of iberian lynx. thus, it is important to notice that multiresistant bacteria have reached species as rare and completely non-synanthropic as the iberian lynx. furthermore, the susceptibility of this endangered species to bacterial infection may be affected by the presence of these virulence and resistance genes.

TI  == comparison of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from water and clinical samples: antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic relationships.
AB  == enterococci are part of the normal intestinal flora in a large number of mammals, and these microbes are currently used as indicators of fecal contamination in water and food for human consumption. these organisms are considered one of the primary causes of nosocomial and environmental infections due to their ability to survive in the environment and to their intrinsic resistance to antimicrobials. the aims of this study were to determine the biochemical patterns and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates from clinical samples and from water (groundwater, water from the xochimilco wetland, and treated water from the mexico city metropolitan area) and to determine the genetic relationships among these isolates. a total of 121 enterococcus strains were studied; 31 and 90 strains were isolated from clinical  samples and water (groundwater, water from the xochimilco wetland, and water for  agricultural irrigation), respectively. identification to the species level was performed using a multiplex pcr assay, and antimicrobial profiles were obtained using a commercial kit. twenty-eight strains were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). e. faecium strains isolated from water showed an atypical biochemical pattern. the clinical isolates showed higher resistance to antibiotics than those from water. both the enterococci isolated from humans, and those isolated from water showed high genetic diversity according to the pfge analysis, although some strains seemed to be closely related. in conclusion, enterococci isolated from humans and water are genetically different. however, water represents a potential route of transmission to the community and a source  of antimicrobial resistance genes that may be readily transmitted to other, different bacterial species.

AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci clones and inter-hospital spread during an outbreak in taiwan.
AB  == background: in 2003, nosocomial infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) occurred rarely in taiwan. between 2003 and 2010, however, the  average prevalence of vancomycin resistance among enterococci spp. increased from 2% to 16% in community hospitals and from 3% to 21% in medical centers of taiwan. we used molecular methods to investigate the epidemiology of vre in a tertiary teaching hospital in taiwan. methods: between february 2009 and february 2011, rectal samples and infection site specimens were collected from all inpatients in the nephrology ward after patient consent was obtained. vre strain types were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). results: a total of 59 vana gene-containing vre isolates (1 per patient) were obtained; 24 originated from rectal sample surveillance of patients who exhibited no symptoms (22 enterococcus faecium and 2 enterococcus faecalis),  and 35 had developed infections over 3 days after admission (32 e. faecium, 2 e.  faecalis, and 1 enterococcus durans). the 59 vre isolates demonstrated vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of >/=256 mug/m. the mic range for linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin was 0.25-1.5 mug/ml, 0.032-0.25 and 1-4 mug/ml, respectively. for 56 isolates, the mic for teicoplanin was >8 mug/ml. the predominant types in the nephrology ward were mlst types 414, 78, and18 as well as pfge types a, c, and d. conclusion: vres are endemic in nephrology wards. mlst 414 is the most predominant strain. the increase vre prevalence is due to cross-transmission of vre clones st 414,78,18 by undetected vre carriers. because similar vre sts had been reported in a different hospital of taiwan, this finding may indicate inter-hospital vre spread in taiwan. active surveillance and effective infection control policies are important controlling the spread of vre  in high risk hospital zones. all endemic vre strains are resistant to teicoplanin but are sensitive to daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline.

TI  == microevolutionary events involving narrow host plasmids influences local fixation of vancomycin-resistance in enterococcus populations.
AB  == vancomycin-resistance in enterococci (vre) is associated with isolates within st18, st17, st78 enterococcus faecium (efm) and st6 enterococcus faecalis (efs) human adapted lineages. despite of its global spread, vancomycin resistance rates in enterococcal populations greatly vary temporally and geographically. portugal  is one of the european countries where tn1546 (vana) is consistently found in a variety of environments. a comprehensive multi-hierarchical analysis of vre isolates (75 efm and 29 efs) from portuguese hospitals and aquatic surroundings (1996-2008) was performed to clarify the local dynamics of vre. clonal relatedness was established by pfge and mlst while plasmid characterization comprised the analysis of known relaxases, rep initiator proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems (ta) by pcr-based typing schemes, rflp comparison, hybridization and sequencing. tn1546 variants were characterized by pcr overlapping/sequencing. intra- and inter-hospital dissemination of efm st18, st132 and st280 and efs st6 clones, carrying rolling-circle (pefnp1/pri1) and theta-replicating (pciz2-like, inc18, phtbeta-like, two prum-variants, plg1-like, and pheromone-responsive) plasmids was documented. tn1546 variants, mostly containing isef1 or is1216, were located on plasmids (30-150 kb) with a high degree of mosaicism and heterogeneous rflp patterns that seem to have resulted from the interplay between broad host inc18 plasmids (pip501, pre25, pef1), and narrow host repa_n plasmids (prum, pad1-like). tas of inc18 (omega-epsilon-zeta)  and prum (axe-txe) plasmids were infrequently detected. some plasmid chimeras were persistently recovered over years from different clonal lineages. this work  represents the first multi-hierarchical analysis of vre, revealing a frequent recombinatorial diversification of a limited number of interacting clonal backgrounds, plasmids and transposons at local scale. these interactions provide  a continuous process of parapatric clonalization driving a full exploration of the local adaptive landscape, which might assure long-term maintenance of resistant clones and eventually fixation of tn1546 in particular geographic areas.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == nasal and perirectal colonization of vancomycin sensitive and resistant enterococci in patients of paediatrics icu (picu) of tertiary health care facilities.
AB  == background: enterococci normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and are also a potential pathogen in causing nosocomial infections. the increase in antibiotic resistance and transfer of antibiotic resistance gene to staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) due to co-colonization has increased its importance in research. the aim of the study was to evaluate local epidemiology of nasal and rectal colonization with enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and enterococcus faecium (e. faecium) in patients of paediatrics intensive care unit  (picu) and correlation with clinical and socioeconomic factors. methods: the nasal and perirectal swab samples were collected from 110 patients admitted in picus of three tertiary care hospitals of rawalpindi medical college, pakistan. the identification of enterococci was done by biochemical tests and by pcr for ddl, vana and vanb genes. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion and mics were determined for vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and oxacillin only. results: out of 220 nasal and perirectal samples, 09 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and 76 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci  (vse), consisting of 40 e. faecalis and 45 e. faecium were isolated. pcr successfully identified both species with ddl primers and vre with vana primer. with disc diffusion method, all isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested except linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. vre showed resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin both and none was resistant to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. generally, e. faecium isolates were more resistant than e. faecalis. mics of vancomycin for nasal and perirectal vre were 512 mg/l and 64 to 512 mg/l respectively. vre were more in patients with prolonged hospitalization, from urban localities and those having pneumonia. conclusion: present study reveals high colonization and antibiotic resistance in enterococcal isolates from nasal and perirectal area. nasal colonization by enterococci in picu is more alarming as vre may cause infection and can transfer this resistance gene to other microorganisms like s. aureus.

TI  == enterococcal endocarditis in the beginning of the 21st century: analysis from the international collaboration on endocarditis-prospective cohort study.
AB  == enterococci are reportedly the third most common group of endocarditis-causing pathogens but data on enterococcal infective endocarditis (ie) are limited. the aim of this study was to analyse the characteristics and prognostic factors of enterococcal ie within the international collaboration on endocarditis. in this multicentre, prospective observational cohort study of 4974 adults with definite  ie recorded from june 2000 to september 2006, 500 patients had enterococcal ie. their characteristics were described and compared with those of oral and group d  streptococcal ie. prognostic factors for enterococcal ie were analysed using multivariable cox regression models. the patients' mean age was 65 years and 361/500 were male. twenty-three per cent (117/500) of cases were healthcare related. enterococcal ie were more frequent than oral and group d streptococcal ie in north america. the 1-year mortality rate was 28.9% (144/500). e. faecalis accounted for 90% (453/500) of enterococcal ie. resistance to vancomycin was observed in 12 strains, eight of which were observed in north america, where they accounted for 10% (8/79) of enterococcal strains, and was more frequent in e. faecium than in e. faecalis (3/16 vs. 7/364 , p 0.01). variables significantly associated with 1-year mortality were heart failure (hr 2.4, 95% ci 1.7--3.5, p <0.0001), stroke (hr 1.9, 95% ci 1.3--2.8, p 0.001) and age (hr 1.02 per 1-year increment, 95% ci 1.01--1.04, p 0.002). surgery was not associated with better outcome. enterococci are an important cause of ie, with a high mortality rate. healthcare association and vancomycin resistance are common in particular in north america.

AB  == we report the results of the international daptomycin surveillance programs for europe, latin america, and selected asia-pacific nations. a total of 7948 consecutive gram-positive organisms of clinical significance were collected in 2011 and susceptibility tested against daptomycin and various comparator agents by clinical and laboratory standards institute (clinical and laboratory standards institute. m07-a9. methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard: ninth edition wayne, pa: clsi. 2012.; cubicin package insert 2012. cubist pharmaceuticals, inc, lexington, ma. available at http://www.cubicin.com/pdf/prescribinginformation.pdf. accessed january 1, 2012.) broth microdilution methods. the test medium was adjusted to contain physiological levels of calcium (50 mg/l) when testing daptomycin. daptomycin exhibited potent activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus overall and for each region (mic(50/90), 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/ml), with susceptibility rates at 100.0% in latin america, australia/new zealand, and india, and at 99.9% in europe. the daptomycin mic(50/90) for coagulase-negative staphylococci was also at 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/ml,  and only 1 isolate was considered nonsusceptible with a mic value at 2 mug/ml. daptomycin was also highly active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(50/90), 1/1-2 mug/ml) and e. faecium (mic(50/90), 2/2 mug/ml for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates). all enterococcal isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (mic, </=4 mug/ml) and tigecycline. susceptibility to linezolid for e. faecalis was at 100.0%, while for e. faecium regional susceptibility rates were at 100.0% except in europe (99.0%). viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/1 mug/ml) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mug/ml) continue to be very susceptible to daptomycin.  in summary, the results of this investigation document the high potency and wide  spectrum of daptomycin when tested against a large resistance-surveillance collection of gram-positive pathogens and indicate that daptomycin nonsusceptibility remains rare among indicated species after many years of clinical use worldwide.

AB  == the genetic bases for antibiotic tolerance are obscure. daptomycin (dap) is a lipopeptide antibiotic with bactericidal activity against enterococci. using time-kill assays, we provide evidence for the first time that a deletion of isoleucine in position 177 of liaf, a member of the three-component regulatory system liafsr involved in the cell envelope response to antimicrobials, is directly responsible for a dap-tolerant phenotype and is likely to negatively affect response to dap therapy.

TI  == antibiotics and heavy metals resistance and other biological characters in enterococci isolated from surface water of monte cotugno lake (italy).
AB  == considering the limited knowledge about the biological characters in enterococci  isolated from surface waters, we investigated antibiotic and heavy-metal resistance, bacteriocin production, and some important virulence traits of 165 enterococci collected in water samples from monte cotugno lake, the largest artificial basin built with earth in europe. the species distribution of isolates was as follows: enterococcus faecium (80%), enterococcus faecalis (12.7%), enterococcus casseliflavus (3%), enterococcus mundtii (1.8%), enterococcus hirae  (1.8%), enterococcus durans (0.6%). all enterococci showed heavy metal resistance toward cu, ni, pb and zn, were susceptible to ag and hg, and at the same time exhibited in large percentage (83.7%) resistance to one or more of the antibiotics tested. relatively to virulence factor genes, 50.9% enterococci were  positive for gelatinase (gele), 10.9% for aggregation substance (agg), 12.7% and  66.6% for the cell wall adhesins (efaafs and efaafm), respectively. no amplicons  were detected after pcr for cytolysin production (cyla, cylb and cylm) and enterococcal surface protein (esp) genes. bacteriocin production was found in most of the isolates. given that the waters of the monte cotugno lake are used for different purposes, among which farming and recreational activities, they can contribute to spread enterococci endowed with virulence factors, and antibiotics  and heavy metals resistance to humans.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus spp. isolated from environmental samples in an area of intensive poultry production.
AB  == enterococcus spp. from two poultry farms and proximate surface and ground water sites in an area of intensive poultry production were tested for resistance to 16 clinical antibiotics. resistance patterns were compared to assess trends and possible correlations for specific antimicrobials and levels of resistance. enterococci were detected at all 12 surface water sites and three of 28 ground water sites. resistance to lincomycin, tetracycline, penicillin and ciprofloxacin in poultry litter isolates was high (80.3%, 65.3%, 61.1% and 49.6%, respectively). resistance in the surface water to the same antibiotics was 87.1%, 24.1%, 7.6% and 12.9%, respectively. overall, 86% of litter isolates, 58% of surface water isolates and 100% of ground water isolates were resistant to more than one antibiotic. fifty-four different resistance patterns were recognised in  isolates obtained from litter and environmental samples and several e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates from litter and environment samples shared the same resistance pattern. multiple antibiotic resistant (mar) indices calculated to assess health risks due to the presence of resistant enterococci suggested an increased presence of antibiotics in surface water, likely from poultry sources as no other wastewater contributions in the area were documented.

TI  == vancomycin resistant enterococci: from the hospital effluent to the urban wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == vancomycin is an important antibiotic to treat serious nosocomial enterococci infections. human activities, in particular those related with clinical practices performed in hospitals, can potentiate the transfer and selection of clinically-relevant resistant bacteria such as vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre). indeed, previous studies demonstrated the occurrence of vre in urban wastewater treatment plants and related environments (e.g. sewage, rivers). in this study, the occurrence of vre in a hospital effluent and in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant was investigated. vancomycin and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria occurred in the hospital effluent and in raw municipal inflow  at densities of 10(3) to 10(2) cfu ml(-1), being significantly more prevalent in  the hospital effluent than in the urban wastewater. most of the vre isolated from the hospital effluent belonged to the species enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and presented multidrug-resistance phenotypes to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and high-level gentamicin. the same pattern was observed in clinical isolates and in enterococci isolated from the final effluent of the urban wastewater treatment plant. these results show that hospital effluents discharged into urban wastewater treatment plants may be a relevant source of resistance spread to the environment.

TI  == occurrence, genetic diversity, and persistence of enterococci in a lake superior  watershed.
AB  == in 2012, the u.s. epa suggested that coastal and great lakes states adopt enterococci as an alternative indicator for the monitoring of recreational water  quality. limited information, however, is available about the presence and persistence of enterococci in lake superior. in this study, the density, species  composition, and persistence of enterococci in sand, sediment, water, and soil samples were examined at two sites in a lake superior watershed from may to september over a 2-year period. the genetic diversity of enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from environmental samples was also studied by using the horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced repetitive pcr dna fingerprinting technique. results obtained by most-probable-number analyses indicated that enterococci were present in 149 (94%) of 159 samples and their densities were generally higher in  the summer than in the other months examined. the enterococcus species composition displayed spatial and temporal changes, with the dominant species being e. hirae, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. mundtii, and e. casseliflavus. dna fingerprint analyses indicated that the e. faecalis population in the watershed was genetically diverse and changed spatially and temporally. moreover, some dna  fingerprints reoccurred over multiple sampling events. taken together, these results suggest that some enterococci are able to persist and grow in the lake superior watershed, especially in soil, for a prolonged time after being introduced.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of methanol extracts of crabapple mangrove tree (sonneratia caseolaris linn.) against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == the crabapple mangrove tree, sonneratia caseolaris linn. (family: sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. according to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. the antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (gram-positive i.e. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and gram-negative i.e. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-pseudomonas aeruginosa and acenetobacter baumannii). the methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the gram-positive bacteria. using soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity  and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.

AB  == we report the first study on the occurrence of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococci in coastal bathing waters and beach sand in malaysia. none of the encountered isolates were resistant to high levels  of gentamicin (500 mug/ml). however, high-level resistance to kanamycin (2,000 mug/ml) was observed in 14.2 % of tested isolates, the highest proportions observed being among beach sand isolates. high-level resistance to kanamycin was  higher among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium than enterococcus spp. chi-square analysis showed no significant association between responses to tested antibiotics and the species allocation or source of isolation of all tested enterococci. the species classification of encountered enterococci resistance to vancomycin was highest among enterococcus spp. (5.89 %) followed by e. faecium (4.785) and least among e. faecalis. a total of 160 isolates were also tested for virulence characteristics. on the whole, caseinase production was profoundly highest (15.01 %) while the least prevalent virulence characteristic observed among tested beach enterococci was haemolysis of rabbit blood (3.65 %).  a strong association was observed between the source of isolation and responses for each of caseinase (c = 0.47, v = 0.53) and slime (c = 0.50, v = 0.58) assays. analysis of obtained spearman's coefficient showed a strong correlation between caseinase and each of the slime production (p = 0.04), gelatinase (p = 0.0035) and haemolytic activity on horse blood (p = 0.004), respectively. suggestively, these are the main virulent characteristics of the studied beach enterococci. our findings suggest that recreational beaches may contribute to the dissemination of enterococci with hlar and virulence characteristics.

TI  == microbiological survey of imported produce available at retail across canada.
AB  == increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in canada and other developed countries. however, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. to this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across canada during a period of limited domestic availability. in total, 106 samples obtained  from five canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (apc) and coliform counts, and  enrichments for enterococci, indicator escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. also, recovered enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (amr). overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (columbia, dominican republic, guatemala, mexico, and the united states [us]). apcs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean  log10 cfu/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. excluding a  single leafy green sample from guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was  for mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on us leafy greens. with the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 cfu/g). of the commodities assessed, mexican and us spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 cfu/g). organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. the most frequent recovery of indicator e. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from columbia, us, and mexico, respectively. for spinach, 0 and 6.7% of mexican and us samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. no e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella spp. were detected. e. faecium and e. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7%  of samples, respectively. although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella were not detected. however, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.

AB  == longitudinal national data on resistance in enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium  from different sources in taiwan are rare. the present study analyzed data from the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program to address this issue. between 2002 and 2010, a total of 1696 e. faecalis and 452 e. faecium isolates were studied. although these 2 species together comprised similar percentages of all enterococci in each study year (94.1-97.2%, p = 0.19), the proportion of e. faecium increased from 12.4% in 2002 to 27.3% in 2010 (p < 0.001). the most noteworthy change in susceptibilities of these 2 species was vancomycin resistance in e. faecium (vrefm), which increased from 0.3% in 2004 to 24.9% in 2010 (p < 0.001). vrefm prevalence differed significantly between geographic regions, patient age groups, and locations. multidrug resistance was very common in both species even in isolates from outpatients (82.7% for e. faecalis and 98.1% for e. faecium), at rates similar to those from intensive care unit (icu) and non-icu patients (80.5-80.9% in e. faecalis and 97.2-98.6% in e. faecium). nonsusceptibility to linezolid was <0.5% in both species. all tested isolates were susceptible to daptomycin. continuous surveillance of vre prevalence and survey of community reservoirs of multidrug-resistant enterococci  are warranted.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == high frequency of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis in an iranian referral children medical hospital.
AB  == background: enterococci have emerged in recent years as important nosocomial pathogens. although most enterococcal human infections are caused by enterococcus faecalis, studies on vancomycin resistance are usually limited to enterococcus faecium isolates and a little is known about e. faecalis. therefore we undertook  this study to obtain information about the prevalence of vancomycin -resistant e. faecalis (vref) and genes responsible for resistance. material and methods: ninety-one e. faecalis isolates of different patients admitted at children's medical center from august 2009 to june 2010 were included in this cross-sectional study. antimicrobial testing was performed by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to clinical laboratories standards institute (clsi). results: among all isolates, 15 (16%) were identified as vr e. faecalis. pcr analysis revealed that all vref isolates were positive for the vana gene. conclusion: the present study reports the highest range of vref in iran. the increased frequency of vref, as seen with rapid rise in the number of vana isolates should be considered in infection control practices.

TI  == [comparison of phoenix automated system, api id 32 strep system and lightcycler enterococcus mgrade system in the identification of clinical enterococcus isolates].
AB  == enterococci which are part of the commensal flora of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, are increasing in importance as the cause of hospital-acquired infections. identification of enterococcus spp. at the species  level is of great importance, for appropriate treatment of patients, infection control and to supply epidemiological data. conventional methods for the identification of enterococcus isolates at species level is difficult and time consuming. correct identification of enterococcus isolates in clinical microbiology laboratory by conventional methods is replaced by semi-automated or  automated identification and molecular methods. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of phoenix automated system (bd diagnostic systems, usa), api rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux, france) and enterococcus mgrade lightcycler kit (roche molecular biochemicals, germany) used in real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), for the species level identification of enterococcus strains isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 90 vancomycin susceptible enterococci isolated from different patients were identified by all of the three commercial systems, together with conventional methods. of the strains, 59 were identified as e.faecalis, 28 were e.faecium, and one of each as  e.raffinosus, e.hirae and e.casseliflavus with conventional methods. one e.faecalis strain identified by the conventional system was identified as e.faecium by phoenix system and one e.faecium strain as e.durans. one e.raffinosus strain identifed by the conventional method was identified as e.avium by api. conventionally identified four e.faecalis strains were determined to be e.faecium by rt-pcr and one e.faecium, one e.raffinosus and one e.casseliflavus as e.faecalis. accordingly, the consistency of phoenix, api rapid id 32 strep and lightcycler enterococcus mgrade systems with the conventional methods were detected as 97.8% (88/90), 98.9% (89/90), and 92.2% (83/90), respectively. in conclusion, all of those three commercial assays are appropriate methods to be used for the identification of enterococci at the species level in  the routine clinical microbiology laboratories, due to their high compliance with the conventional method, and their ability to yield the results at the same day.

TI  == sources of systematic errors in the epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == purpose: the rates of vancomycin resistance among enterococci (vre) have been increasing worldwide. however, reports on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre)  are easily biased and meta-data reporting is insufficient. additionally, no standardised protocol for vre testing currently exists. the aim of our study was  to investigate, for the first time, the impact of introduced bias in vre reports. we also analysed the sensitivity of our in-house screening test for vre, namely,  a broth-enriched pcr assay. methods: retrospective review of microbial and clinical data on all patients tested for vre who had been admitted to a large university hospital over a 5-year period and an analysis of the possible impact of introduced bias. our screening test was also evaluated using clinical isolates. results: a total of 27,636 screening tests were carried out over the 5-year study period, of which 2,459 were vre-positive. the number of screening tests increased dramatically over the study period, with 1,053 tests carried out  on 435 patients in 2006 and 9,444 tests carried out on 5,104 patients in 2010. vre prevalence was 8.1 % over the 5-year period. the introduction of measurement  bias caused a clear overestimation of absolute vre numbers. the sensitivity of our screening test was 95.5 % with a positive predictive value of 39 %. conclusion: biased reports lead to the implementation of high-cost containment measures that may be both unnecessary and detrimental to the patient. our data show that systematic errors in vre reports caused a clear overestimation of absolute vre numbers, thereby indicating an outbreak situation even though the actual prevalence of vre was decreasing. we suggest that reports of vre must take measurement and analysis biases into account, otherwise any conclusion drawn is unreliable and inconclusive.

TI  == virulence traits and antibiotic resistance among enterococci isolated from eurasian otter (lutra lutra).
AB  == enterococci are ubiquitous microorganisms found as part of the normal intestinal  microbiota of many animals such as the free-ranging eurasian otter (lutra lutra linnaeus, 1758). in this work, twenty-nine enterococci isolated from fecal samples of eurasian otters free-living in reservoirs and associated river stretches in south portugal were identified and typed by conventional/molecular methods and screened for virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. identification allocated the isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis (19),  e. faecium (9) and e. durans (1) and pcr-fingerprinting revealed their high genomic diversity. regarding virulence factors, three isolates produced cytolysin and six were gelatinase-positive. genes ace and acm were detected in five enterococci each, ebpabc in seventeen, gele in fourteen and cyla in three. all isolates showed resistance patterns and antibiotic resistance genes tet(m) and pbp5 were detected in seventeen isolates each, whereas vanb and vand were identified in thirteen and five, respectively, being most van-harboring isolates  members of e. faecium. the aac(6')-ie-aph (2'') gene, encoding for gentamicin resistance, was observed in all gentamicin-resistant enterococci. since all isolates harbor virulence and/or antibiotic resistance traits, the role of free-living eurasian otters in the dissemination of virulent/resistant enterococci among other animals sharing the same ecological niche cannot be disregarded, as well as the health risk they may represent for humans directly interacting with them or their habitat.

TI  == update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the usa: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011).
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. dal potency was assessed in the 2011 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9  us census regions. monitored gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus (sa; 1,036/50.4% mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 115), enterococcus faecalis (25), e. faecium (31), streptococcus pyogenes (155), streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (vgs; 40). all susceptibility (s) testing used clinical and laboratory standards institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. dal (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/ml) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (dap) and vancomycin (van), respectively against sa, with mssa and mrsa having the same mic(90) results. cons was slightly more dal-s (mic(50), </=0.03mug/ml). the highest staphylococcal dal mic was only 0.25 mug/ml. beta-haemolytic streptococci (betahs) and vgs had dal mic results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml (mic(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/ml), and only enterococci showed elevated dal mic results. vana phenotype-resistant e. faecalis or e. faecium had dal mic values at >/=1 mug/ml; vanb strains were dal-s (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). all cited dal quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of mic creep. in conclusion, year 2011 sentry program data for dal documents sustained potent activity against sa, cons, betahs, vgs, and van-s  enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than van, dap, or linezolid.

TI  == independent risk factors for the co-colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the region most endemic for vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolation.
AB  == in the majority of cases of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vr e. faecalis) served as the vana donor to s. aureus. previous studies that evaluated the risk factors for co-colonization with vre and mrsa did not differentiate between vr e. faecalis and vr e. faecium. this study aimed to identify variables associated with vr e. faecalis and mrsa co-colonization. a retrospective case-control study from january 2008 to december 2009 was conducted at the detroit medical center. data were extracted from charts and pharmacy records. unique patients co-colonized with vr e. faecalis and mrsa (defined as isolation of mrsa within 7 days of vr e. faecalis isolation) were compared with patients with vr e. faecalis who were not  co-colonized with mrsa. a total of 546 patients with vr e. faecalis isolation were identified. 85 (15.6 %) vr e. faecalis patients were co-colonized with mrsa  and 461 (84.4 %) vr e. faecalis patients were not co-colonized with mrsa. the mean age of the study cohort was 65.9 +/- 16.4 years, 424 (77.7 %) were african-american, and 270 (49.5 %) were residing in long-term care institutions.  independent predictors of co-colonization of vr e. faecalis and mrsa were male gender, impaired consciousness, icu stay prior to vr e. faecalis isolation, indwelling devices, and isolation of vr e. faecalis from wounds. mrsa was frequently isolated from the same culture specimen as vr e. faecalis (n = 39, 45.9 %), most commonly from wounds. this large study of patients with vr e. faecalis identified the severity of illness, indwelling devices, and chronic wounds as independent predictors of co-colonization with vr e. faecalis and mrsa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == verigene(r) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. this study examined its in vitro activity against relevant gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 40 meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 45 enterococcus faecalis, 60 enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 streptococcus pneumoniae. except with vana enterococci, telavancin mics were tightly clustered and unimodal. telavancin mics for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/l to 0.5mg/l, with no shift for mrsa or mssa in relation to vancomycin mic. nevertheless, and independently of species, cons with raised vancomycin mics had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. modal telavancin mics were 0.5mg/l and </=0.03 mg/l for glycopeptide-susceptible e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively, with no rise for vanb isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/l and 1-4 mg/l for vana isolates, respectively. streptococci were consistently susceptible, with mics of </=0.06 mg/l. telavancin mics by etest agreed within 1  doubling dilution with those found previously by bsac agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. in the few cases (13/345)  where telavancin mics by etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those  by agar dilution, the etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with vana, with no erosion of this activity against mrsa with raised  vancomycin mics. mics by etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by bsac agar dilution.

TI  == the prevalence and the characterization of the enterococcus species from various  clinical samples in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  == background: enterococci form a part of the normal flora of the intestinal tract,  the oral cavity, and the vagina, but in recent times, they have become emerging nosocomial pathogens. their increasing importance is largely due to their resistance to antimicrobials. the therapeutic failures in enterococcal infections are mainly due to the intrinsic as well as transferable drug resistance. the main aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of the enterococcus infection and to determine the antibiogram in a tertiary care hospital. method: enterococcus was isolated from a total of 5555 clinical samples like urine , pus, tissue, blood and body fluids during the period from january to december 2008. the isolates were speciated by using conventional biochemical tests (facklam and collins). the antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the kirby bauer disc  diffusion method. confirmation of vancomycin susceptibility was done by the epsilometer test (e test) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). result: from various clinical samples, 128 enterococcus species were isolated in a period of one year and the rate of the infection was estimated to be 2.3%. among the isolates, those of enterococcus faecalis (e.faecalis) were 97(76%) and the remaining 31(24%) were of enterococcus faecium (e.faecium). the maximum number of isolates were from pus 55(43%), followed by the isolates from urine 40(31%). the sensitivity pattern of these isolates showed an increased resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. a high level of gentamicin resistance (hlgr) was present in 60 (47% ) isolates of enterococcus and 35(27%) isolates were intermediately sensitive to vancomycin by the kirby bauer disc diffusion method. all the intermediately sensitive isolates to vancomycin were further tested by the e test and they were found to be vancomycin sensitive. conclusion: various studies have shown an increase in the rate of infection and the antibiotic resistance in the enterococcus species. there is also a change in the pattern of the enterococcus infection, with an increase in the isolation rate of e. faecium and other non faecalis enterococcus species. the kirby bauer disc diffusion method is not an accurate method for detecting the vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre).

AB  == ninety four infants were observed as inpatients. thirty nine of them were mature  neonates and 55 were premature infants with a very low body weight. the majority  of the patients were treated with antibiotics. the mature infants were treated with penicillins, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and the premature neonates were treated in addition with carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides. the mature infants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (n=18) received the standard therapy and the main group (n=21) in addition received 1 ml of liquid probiotic enterococcus faecium l3 (with a titer of 5x10(8) cfu/ml) 2 times a day  for 10 days. the premature newborn infants were also randomized into 2 groups. the control group (n=26) received the standard therapy. the main group (n=29) additionally received 1 ml of liquid probiotic e.faecium l3 2 times a day for 10  days. the effectiveness of the therapy in the mature neonates was evaluated by the frequency of dyspeptic disorders and in the premature infants by the frequency of infectious complications and the episodes of food intolerance. the intestinal microbiota of the infants was investigated by the real-time pcr and bacteriological analyses of the feces: in the mature infants on admission to the  hospital and 10 days after the treatment (periods 1-2), in the premature infants  on admission to the hospital and then twice with an interval of 14 days (periods  1-2-3). it was shown that the use of the probiotic strain e.faecium l3 during the antibiotic therapy in the premature infants promoted significant reduction in the frequency of infectious complications. in the mature neonates the probiotic therapy reduced the risk of dyspeptic disorder. the studies showed reduction in persistence of clostridium difficile in the intestinal microbiota of the newborn  infants receiving the antibiotic therapy in combination with probiotic e.faecium  l3, that was accompanied by preserving and growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and reduction of the number of opportunistic microorganisms.

AB  == the design, synthesis and antibiotic activities of the modified carboxylate binding pocket (d-o-e ring) of vancomycin (1) are summarized in this short account. the preliminary structure-activity relationship (sar) studies indicated  that both the structure of the 16-membered macrocycle including the absolute configuration of the modified aa4 unit and the presence of a hydrophobic chain were important for anti-vre activities of these series of synthetic analogues. compounds 9c and 9d in which the central amino acid (aa4) of vancomycin was replaced by (2r,3r)-alpha-hydroxy-beta-amino acid and (2r,3r)-alpha,beta-diamino  acid, respectively, were found to be useful templates in searching for active compounds against both vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant strains. two of these  compounds (16d and 16n) having an elongated peptide chain at the c-terminal were  found to be active against a broad spectrum of both vancomycin-sensitive (staphylococcus aureus) and -resistant strains (e. faecium, e. faecalis).

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular antibiotic resistance profile of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from different traditional fermented foods.
AB  == a collection of 55 enterococci (41 enterococcus faecium and 14 e. faecalis strains) isolated from various traditional fermented foodstuffs of both animal and vegetable origins, and water was evaluated for resistance against 15 antibiotics. lower incidence of resistance was observed with gentamicin, ampicillin, penicillin and teicoplanin. however, a high incidence of antibiotic resistance was detected for rifampicin (12 out of 14 of isolates), ciprofloxacin  (9/14), and quinupristin/dalfopristin (8/14) in e. faecalis strains. enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to rifampicin (25/41), ciprofloxacin (23/41), erythromycin (18/41), levofloxacin (16/41), and nitrofurantoin (15/41). one enterococcus faecalis and two e. faecium strains were resistant to vancomycin (mic>16 mug/ml). among 55 isolates, 27 (19 e. faecium and eight e. faecalis) were resistant to at least three antibiotics. high level of multidrug resistance to clinically important antibiotics was detected in e. faecalis strains (57% of e. faecalis versus 46% of e. faecium), which showed resistance to six to seven antibiotics, especially those isolated from foods of animal origin. so, it is necessary to re-evaluate the use of therapeutic antibiotics in stock farms at both regional and international levels due to the high number of multiple resistant (mr) bacteria. fifty-six mr e. faecalis and e. faecium strains selected from this and previous studies (valenzuela et al., 2008, 2010) were screened by polymerase chain reaction for antibiotic resistance genes, revealing the presence of tet(l), tet(m), ermb, cat, efra, efrb, mpha, or msra/b genes. the abc multidrug efflux pump efrab was detected in 96% of e. faecalis strains and also in 13% of e. faecium strains; this is the first report describing efrab in this enterococcal species. the efflux pump-associated msra/b gene was detected in 66.66% of e. faecium strains, but not in e. faecalis strains.

TI  == pseudo-outbreak of vancomycin-resistant-enterococcus (vre) colonization in a neonatal intensive care unit using spectra vre surveillance medium.
AB  == from november 2011 through march 2012, we surveyed 272 babies in our neonatal intensive care unit for rectal colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). using spectra vre medium (remel diagnostics, lenexa, ks), we identified one neonate colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in addition, 55 (13%) of the surveillance cultures yielded false-positive results with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis. during the same time period, 580 rectal swabs were collected from adult patients resulting in 20 (3%) false-positive cultures. the difference in false-positive rates between cultures  from babies and adults was statistically significant (p < 0.001), prompting an investigation of factors that might influence the elevated false-positive rate in the neonates including patient demographics, nutrition, and topical ointments applied at the time of testing. older neonates, with a median age of 6 weeks, were more likely to have false-positive cultures than younger neonates with a median age of 3 weeks (p < 0.001). the younger neonates receiving similac expert  care products were less likely to have false-positive surveillance cultures than  those receiving other formulas (p < 0.001). application of topical products was not associated with false-positive cultures. the false-positive e. faecalis strains were typed by diversilab rep-pcr (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and found to represent eight different groups of isolates. the utility of the spectra vre media appeared to be significantly impacted by the age of the patients screened.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from diseased farm animals: pigs, cattle and poultry.
AB  == eighty enterococcal isolates (e. faecium, n = 38, e. faecalis, n = 42) from diseased farm animals (swine, cattle, poultry) in lithuania have been studied for the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and for resistance and virulence genetic  determinants. 86% of e. faecium and 71% of e. faecalis isolates were multidrug resistant (resistant to three or more unrelated antibiotics). resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline and erythromycin was found most frequently in both  species (61%, 69%) and was linked to aph(3')-iiia, aac(6')-ie-aph(2")-ia, ant(6)-ia (aminoglycoside resistance), tetm, tetl (tetracycline resistance), erma, ermb (erythromycin resistance) gene combinations, which were supplemented with chloramphenicol resistance genes cata7, cata8 (e. faecalis) and cata9 (e. faecium). all e. faecalis isolates harboured genes coding for virulence factors agg, esp, fsr gele alone or in combinations with the high prevalence of esp gene  in isolates from cattle (63%) and pigs (79%). the origin-dependent incidence of agg gene variants prgb and asp1 was observed. the results indicate the existence  of a large pool of potentially virulent and multidrug resistant e. faecalis in diseased farm animals posing risk to humans.

TI  == twenty-five years of shared life with vancomycin-resistant enterococci: is it time to divorce?
AB  == twenty-five years ago, isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrem) was reported both in the uk and in france. since then, vrem has spread worldwide in hospitals. hospital outbreaks appeared to be related to the evolution since the end of 1980s of a subpopulation of e. faecium highly resistant to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones (the so-called clonal complex cc17)  that later acquired resistance to vancomycin. cc17 isolates are presumably better adapted than other e. faecium isolates to the constraints of the hospital environment and most contain mobile genetic elements, phage genes, genes encoding membrane proteins, regulatory genes, a putative pathogenicity island and megaplasmids. colonization and persistence are major features of vrem. inherent characteristics of e. faecium including a remarkable genome plasticity, in part due to acquisition of is elements, in particular is16, have facilitated niche adaptation of this distinct e. faecium subpopulation that is multiply resistant to antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are licensed for the treatment of vrem infections, with linezolid often used as a first-line treatment. however, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid by  production of a cfr methyltransferase in enterococcus faecalis is worrying. daptomycin has not been extensively evaluated for the treatment of vrem infections and resistant mutants have been selected under daptomycin therapy. although control of vre is challenging, a laissez-faire policy would result in an increased number of infections and would create an irreversible situation. although so far unsuccessful, dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant staphylococcus aureus with van genes acquired from resistant enterococci cannot be ruled out.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

TI  == biochemical characterization of cardiolipin synthase mutations associated with daptomycin resistance in enterococci.
AB  == daptomycin (dap) resistance in enterococci has been linked to mutations in genes  that alter the cell envelope stress response (cesr) (liafsr) and changes in enzymes that directly affect phospholipid homeostasis, and these changes may alter membrane composition, such as that of cardiolipin synthase (cls). while cls substitutions are observed in response to dap therapy, the effect of these mutations on cls activity remains obscure. we have expressed, purified, and characterized cls enzymes from both enterococcus faecium s447 (residues 52 to 482; cls447a) and enterococcus faecalis s613 (residues 53 to 483; cls613a) as well as cls variants harboring a single-amino-acid change derived from dap-resistant isolates of e. faecium. e. faecium cls447a and e. faecalis cls613a  are tightly associated with the membrane and copurify with their substrate, phosphatidylglycerol (pg), and product, cardiolipin (cl). the amount of pg that copurifies with cls is in molar excess to protein, suggesting that the enzyme localizes to pg-rich membrane regions. both cls447a(h215r) and cls447a(r218q) showed an increase in v(max) (mum cl/min/mum protein) from 0.16 +/- 0.01 to 0.26  +/- 0.02 and 0.26 +/- 0.04, respectively, indicating that mutations associated with adaptation to dap increase cls activity. modeling of cls447a to streptomyces sp. phospholipase d indicates that the adaptive mutations cls447a(h215r) and cls447a(r218q) are proximal to the phospholipase domain 1 (pld1) active site and  near the putative nucleophile h217. as mutations to cls are part of a larger genomic adaptation process, increased cls activity is likely to be highly epistatic with other changes to facilitate dap resistance.

TI  == whole-genome analysis of a daptomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strain and its daptomycin-resistant variant arising during therapy.
AB  == development of daptomycin (dap) resistance in enterococcus faecalis has recently  been associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins with two main functions: (i) control of the cell envelope stress response to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (liafsr system) and (ii) cell membrane phospholipid metabolism (glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase and cardiolipin synthase  [cls]). however, the genetic bases for dap resistance in enterococcus faecium are unclear. we performed whole-genome comparative analysis of a clinical strain pair, dap-susceptible e. faecium s447 and its dap-resistant derivative r446, which was recovered from a single patient during dap therapy. by comparative whole-genome sequencing, dap resistance in r446 was associated with changes in 8  genes. two of these genes encoded proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism: (i) an r218q substitution in cls and (ii) an a292g reversion in a putative cyclopropane fatty acid synthase enzyme. the dap-resistant derivative r446 also exhibited an s333l substitution in the putative histidine kinase yycg, a member of the yycfg system, which, similar to liafsr, has been involved in cell envelope homeostasis and dap resistance in other gram-positive cocci. additional changes identified in e. faecium r446 (dap resistant) included two putative proteins involved in transport (one for carbohydrate and one for sulfate) and three enzymes predicted to play a role in general metabolism. exchange of the "susceptible" cls allele from s447 for the "resistant" one belonging to r446 did  not affect dap susceptibility. our results suggest that, apart from the liafsr system, the essential yycfg system is likely to be an important mediator of dap resistance in some e. faecium strains.

AB  == enterococci (mainly e. faecalis, e. faecium) are important nosocomial pathogens predominantly affecting older and/or immunocompromised patients. the bacteria possess a broad spectrum of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance properties. among these, the transferrable glycopeptide resistance of the vana and vanb genotypes in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; reservoir: e. faecium) as well as resistance to last resort antibiotics (e.g. linezolid and tigecycline) are of special concern. enterococci (including vre) are easily transferred in hospitals; however, colonizations are far more frequent than infections. resistance frequencies for vancomycin in clinical e. faecium isolates have remained at a relatively constant level of 8-15% (but with local or regional variations) in recent years whereas frequencies for teicoplanin resistance have shown a slight decrease. glycopeptide resistance trends correlate with a spread of hospital-associated e. faecium strains carrying the vana and, with rising frequency in recent years, the vanb gene cluster, the latter being associated with teicoplanin susceptibility. this increased occurrence of vanb-positive e. faecium strains may be caused by an increased use of antibiotics selecting enterococci and vre as well as due to methodological reasons (e.g. reduced eucast mic-breakpoints for glycopeptides; increased use and sensitive performance of chromogenic vre agars, increased use of molecular diagnostic assays).

TI  == molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. clinical isolates recovered from hospitalized patients among several medical institutions  in china.
AB  == the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from china deserve further investigation. this study reports on the molecular characterization of 101 unique vre (96 e. faecium and 5 e. faecalis strains) recovered from diverse samples of 12 hospitals in china. mic results were obtained by reference broth microdilution methods, and vancomycin resistance and virulence genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction. all strains were  subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing. e. faecalis exhibited vancomycin and teicoplanin mic results at >/=256 mug/ml and harbored vana, except for 1 vanb-carrying strain (mic, 32 and 1 mug/ml, respectively). this strain had a unique pfge pattern and was associated with st410 (clonal complex [cc]4). e. faecium displayed vancomycin mic values of  >/=256 mug/ml with variable results for teicoplanin (1-256 mug/ml). one e. faecium had a teicoplanin mic value of 1 mug/ml and carried a vanb, while the other 2 strains had teicoplanin mic values of 4 and 8 mug/ml and harbored vana. e. faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin, and all vre displayed a susceptible phenotype to daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline. four e. faecalis from a particular hospital were grouped within a single pfge type and were associated with st470 and st471 (cc4), which are double- and triple-locus variants of st410 and st4, respectively. overall, e. faecium displayed genetic variability, but clonal dissemination was noted within and among hospitals. all e. faecium belonged to sts associated with cc17, except for 1 strain (st362; cc362). a total of 77.2% and 29.7% of all strains carried esp and hyl, respectively. in conclusion, these results show that vana-carrying isolates predominated in strains from china, and e. faecium strains are usually associated with a common and human-adapted lineage (cc17). unlike the majority of clinical e. faecalis (cc2 and cc9), strains included in this study showed st profiles similar to st4 (cc4), which has been associated with human infections in other asia-pacific countries.

TI  == development of quantitative pcr assays targeting the 16s rrna genes of enterococcus spp. and their application to the identification of enterococcus species in environmental samples.
AB  == the detection of environmental enterococci has been determined primarily by using culture-based techniques that might exclude some enterococcal species as well as  those that are nonculturable. to address this, the relative abundances of enterococci were examined by challenging fecal and water samples against a currently available genus-specific assay (entero1). to determine the diversity of enterococcal species, 16s rrna gene-based group-specific quantitative pcr (qpcr)  assays were developed and evaluated against eight of the most common environmental enterococcal species. partial 16s rrna gene sequences of 439 presumptive environmental enterococcal strains were analyzed to study further the diversity of enterococci and to confirm the specificities of group-specific assays. the group-specific qpcr assays showed relatively high amplification rates with targeted species (>98%), although some assays cross-amplified with nontargeted species (1.3 to 6.5%). the results with the group-specific assays also showed that different enterococcal species co-occurred in most fecal samples. the most abundant enterococci in water and fecal samples were enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, although we identified more water isolates as enterococcus casseliflavus than as any of the other species. the prevalence of the entero1 marker was in agreement with the combined number of positive signals determined by the group-specific assays in most fecal samples, except in gull feces. on the other hand, the number of group-specific assay signals was lower in all water samples tested, suggesting that other enterococcal species are present in these samples. while the results highlight the value of genus- and group-specific assays for detecting the major enterococcal groups in environmental water samples, additional studies are needed to determine further the diversity, distributions, and relative abundances of all enterococcal species found in water.

TI  == intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in enterococcus.
AB  == enterococci have the potential for resistance to virtually all clinically useful  antibiotics. their emergence as important nosocomial pathogens has coincided with increased expression of antimicrobial resistance by members of the genus. the mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance in enterococci may be intrinsic to the species or acquired through mutation of intrinsic genes or horizontal exchange of genetic material encoding resistance determinants. this paper reviews the antibiotic resistance mechanisms in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis and discusses treatment options.

TI  == epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis: a case-case-control study.
AB  == although much is known about vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococcus faecium, little is known about the epidemiology of vr enterococcus faecalis. the predilection of vr e. faecalis to transfer the vancomycin resistance determinant  to staphylococcus aureus is much greater than that of vr e. faecium. the epidemiology of vr e. faecalis has important implications regarding the emergence of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa); 8 of 13 reported vrsa cases have been from michigan. a retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at the detroit medical center, located in southeastern michigan. unique patients with vr e. faecalis infection were matched to patients with strains of vancomycin-susceptible (vs) e. faecalis and to uninfected controls at a 1:1:1 ratio. five hundred thirty-two vr e. faecalis cases were identified and were matched to 532 vs e. faecalis cases and 532 uninfected controls. the overall mean age of the study cohort (n = 1,596) was 63.0 +/- 17.4 years, and 747 (46.8%) individuals were male. independent predictors for the isolation of vr e. faecalis (but not vs e. faecalis) compared to uninfected controls were an age of >/=65 years, nonhome residence, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, exposure to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the prior 3 months, and immunosuppressive status. invasive procedures and/or surgery, chronic skin ulcers, and indwelling devices were risk factors for both vr e. faecalis and vs e. faecalis isolation. cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone exposures were unique, independent predictors for isolation of vr e. faecalis. a majority of case patients had vr e. faecalis present at the time of admission. control of vr e. faecalis, and ultimately vrsa, will likely require regional efforts focusing on infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

TI  == municipal wastewater treatment plants as pathogen removal systems and as a contamination source of noroviruses and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == municipal wastewater treatment plants play a crucial role in reducing the microbial and pathogen load of human wastes before the end-products are discharged to surface waters (final effluent) or land spread (biosolids). this study investigated the occurrence frequency of noroviruses, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in influent, final effluent and biosolids from four secondary wastewater treatment plants in northwestern ireland (plants a-d) and observed the seasonal and spatial variation of the plant treatment efficiencies in the pathogen removals. it was noted that norovirus genogroup ii was more resistant to the treatment processes than the norovirus genogroup i and other active viral particles, especially those in the discharge effluents. the percolating biofilm system at plant d resulted in better effluent quality than in the extended aerated activated sludge systems (plants a and b); primary biosolids produced at plant d may pose a higher health risk to the locals. the spread of norovirus genogroup ii into the environment, irrespective of the wastewater treatment process, coincides with its national clinical predominance over norovirus genogroup i. this study provides important evidence that municipal wastewater treatment plants not only achieve pathogen removal but can also be the source of environmental pathogen contamination.

TI  == daptomycin resistance in enterococci is associated with distinct alterations of cell membrane phospholipid content.
AB  == background: the lipopeptide antibiotic, daptomycin (dap) interacts with the bacterial cell membrane (cm). development of dap resistance during therapy in a clinical strain of enterococcus faecalis was associated with mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in cell envelope homeostasis and phospholipid metabolism. here we characterized changes in cm phospholipid profiles associated  with development of dap resistance in clinical enterococcal strains. methodology: using two clinical strain-pairs of dap-susceptible and dap-resistant e. faecalis  (s613 vs. r712) and e. faecium (s447 vs. r446) recovered before and after dap therapy, we compared four distinct cm profiles: phospholipid content, fatty acid  composition, membrane fluidity and capacity to be permeabilized and/or depolarized by dap. additionally, we characterized the cell envelope of the e. faecium strain-pair by transmission electron microscopy and determined the relative cell surface charge of both strain-pairs. principal findings: both e. faecalis and e. faecium mainly contained four major cm pls: phosphatidylglycerol  (pg), cardiolipin, lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (l-pg) and glycerolphospho-diglycodiacylglycerol (gp-dgdag). in addition, e. faecalis cms (but not e. faecium) also contained: i) phosphatidic acid; and ii) two other unknown species of amino-containing pls. development of dap resistance in both enterococcal species was associated with a significant decrease in cm fluidity and pg content, with a concomitant increase in gp-dgdag. the strain-pairs did not differ in their outer cm translocation (flipping) of amino-containing pls. fatty  acid content did not change in the e. faecalis strain-pair, whereas a significant decrease in unsaturated fatty acids was observed in the dap-resistant e. faecium  isolate r446 (vs s447). resistance to dap in e. faecium was associated with distinct structural alterations of the cell envelope and cell wall thickening, as well as a decreased ability of dap to depolarize and permeabilize the cm. conclusion: distinct alterations in pl content and fatty acid composition are associated with development of enterococcal dap resistance.

AB  == outbreaks of salmonellosis and recalls of low-moisture foods including extruded products highlight the need for the food and feed industries to validate their extrusion processes to ensure the destruction of pathogenic microorganisms. response surface methodology was employed to study the effect of moisture and temperature on inactivation by extrusion of enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354 in a carbohydrate-protein mix. a balanced carbohydrate-protein mix was formulated to different combinations of moisture contents, ranging from 24.9 to 31.1%, and each was inoculated with a pure culture of e. faecium to a final level of 5 log cfu/g. each mix of various moistures was then extruded in a pilot scale extruder at different temperatures (ranging from 67.5 to 85 degrees c). after the extruder was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min, samples were collected in sterile bags, cooled in dry ice, and stored at 4 degrees c prior to analysis. e. faecium was enumerated with tryptic soy agar and membrane enterococcus media, followed by incubation at 35 degrees c for 48 h. each extrusion was repeated twice, with the  central point of the design being repeated four times. from each extrusion, three subsamples were collected for microbial counts and moisture determination. based  on the results, the response surface model was y = 185.04 - 3.11x(1) - 4.23x(2) + 0.02x(1)(2) - 0.004x(1)x(2) + 0.08x(2)(2), with a good fit (r(2) = 0.92), which demonstrated the effects of moisture and temperature on the inactivation of e. faecium during extrusion. according to the response surface analysis, the greatest reduction of e. faecium for the inoculation levels studied here (about 5 log) in a carbohydrate-protein meal would occur at the temperature of 81.1 degrees c and moisture content of 28.1%. other temperature and moisture combinations needed to achieve specific log reductions were plotted in a three-dimensional response surface graph.

AB  == aim: characteristic of pathogenicity factors of enterococci isolated from human feces. materials and methods: production of hemolysin, gelatinase and dnase was determined in 161 enterococci cultures. results: hemolytic activity detected in 14.9 +/- 2.8% of the studied cultures was the most prevalent characteristic; 22 of 24 hemolytic strains belonged to e. faecalis species. human erythrocyte lysis  was also caused by e. faecium and e. durans cultures (1 strain each). other pathogenicity factors were detected solely in e. faecalis species members. enterococci proteolytic activity associated with gelatinase enzyme production manifested on various substrates--both gelatin and milk. this property was detected in 7.5 +/- 2.1% cultures. deoxyribonuclease was detected in 1 (1.2 +/- 0.9%) e. faecalis strain. a number of e. faecalis cultures possessing hemolytic activity additionally hydrolyzed gelatin (22.7 +/- 8.9% strains) and dna (4.5 +/- 4.4% isolates). conclusion: though pathogenicity factors occur in enterococci of  intestine microflora relatively rarely, separate cultures with expression of 2 or more pathogenicity factors may be essential in the development of endogenous infections especially in immune compromised patients.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == indication for co-evolution of lactobacillus johnsonii with its hosts.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota, composed of complex bacterial populations, is host-specific and affected by environmental factors as well as host genetics.  one important bacterial group is the lactic acid bacteria (lab), which include many health-promoting strains. here, we studied the genetic variation within a potentially probiotic lab species, lactobacillus johnsonii, isolated from various hosts. results: a wide survey of 104 fecal samples was carried out for the isolation of l. johnsonii. as part of the isolation procedure, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) was performed to identify l. johnsonii within a selected narrow spectrum of fecal lab. the trflp results showed host specificity of two bacterial species, the enterococcus faecium species cluster and lactobacillus intestinalis, to different host taxonomic groups while the appearance of l. johnsonii and e. faecalis was not correlated with any taxonomic group. the survey ultimately resulted in the isolation of l. johnsonii from few host species. the genetic variation among the 47 l. johnsonii  strains isolated from the various hosts was analyzed based on variation at simple sequence repeats (ssr) loci and multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) of conserved hypothetical genes. the genetic relationships among the strains inferred by each  of the methods were similar, revealing three different clusters of l. johnsonii strains, each cluster consisting of strains from a different host, i.e. chickens, humans or mice. conclusions: our typing results support phylogenetic separation of l. johnsonii strains isolated from different animal hosts, suggesting specificity of l. johnsonii strains to their hosts. taken together with the trflp results, that indicated the association of specific lab species with the host taxonomy, our study supports co-evolution of the host and its intestinal lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == screening fecal enterococci from greek healthy infants for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == enterococci are among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, but they are also characterized as significant nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. a total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by e. faecium, while e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum were also traced. the isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was traced. the ermb gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(l)  being the most frequently observed. in conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates,  from the first days of an infant's life.

TI  == [the incidence of high-level aminoglicoside and high-level beta-lactam resistance among enterococcal strains of various origin].
AB  == introduction: intensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is responsible for conversion of enterococci from commensal bacteria to opportunistic nosocomial pathogenes. the serious infections caused by them are often treated with synergistic bacteriocidal combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside. the presence of high-level aminoglikosyde (hlar) and/or beta-lactam (hlpr) resistance makes this treatment ineffective. methods: this study investigated the differences in occurance of hlar and/or hlpr among groups of enterococi isolated  from: rectal swabs of healthy volunteers, samples of food and clinical specimens. enterococci were identified by 6.5% nacl tolerance and growth on bile-esculin agar with esculin hydrolysis. species-level identification was made on the basis  of motility, pigmentation, arginine hydrolysis, growth on tellurite and formation of acid in mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, arabinose, raffinose and sorbose broth (according to the facklam's and sahm's scheme). high-level resistance were determined to penicillins (> 100 microg/ml), gentamycin (> 500 microg/ml) and streptomycin (> 2000 microg/ml). results: although differences in species prevalence varied by source, e. faecalis was the common enterococcal species in all samples (> 70%), followed by e. faecium (10%-20.4%) and e. durans (4.2%-8.45%). e. faecalis varians, e. pseudoavium and e. raffinossus were isolated rarely. analysis of 452 enterococcal strains revealed the presence hlar  in all groups, but hlpr was not present in samples of food. in community the hlr  was greatest for streptomycin, but among hospital isolations-hlr both to streptomycin and gentamycin were most common. such resistance was more frequent in e. faecium than in e. faecalis. hlr to kanamycin was not found. conclusions: this study shows that high-level resistance to aminoglycoside and/or beta-lactam  of enterococci may play an important role in public health. little is known about the prevalence, risk factors and reservoirs for resistance enterococci outside of the hospital. a comparison of the resistance determinants in isolates from healthy volunteers with the genes responsible for resistance in isolates from patients.

TI  == restricted gene flow among hospital subpopulations of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium has recently emerged as an important multiresistant nosocomial pathogen. defining population structure in this species is required to provide insight into the existence, distribution, and dynamics of specific multiresistant or pathogenic lineages in particular environments, like the hospital. here, we probe the population structure of e. faecium using bayesian-based population genetic modeling implemented in bayesian analysis of population structure (baps) software. the analysis involved 1,720 isolates belonging to 519 sequence types (sts) (491 for e. faecium and 28 for enterococcus faecalis). e. faecium isolates grouped into 13 baps (sub)groups, but the large majority (80%) of nosocomial isolates clustered in two subgroups (2-1 and 3-3). phylogenetic and eburst analysis of baps groups 2 and 3 confirmed the existence of three separate hospital lineages (17, 18, and 78), highlighting different evolutionary trajectories for baps 2-1 (lineage 78) and 3-3 (lineage 17 and lineage 18) isolates. phylogenomic analysis of 29 e. faecium isolates showed agreement between baps assignment of sts and their relative positions in the phylogenetic tree. odds ratio calculation confirmed the significant association between hospital isolates with baps 3-3 and lineages 17, 18, and 78. admixture analysis showed a scarce number of recombination events between the different baps groups. for the e. faecium hospital population, we propose an evolutionary model in which strains with a high propensity to colonize and infect hospitalized patients arise through horizontal gene transfer. once adapted to the distinct hospital niche, this subpopulation becomes isolated, and recombination with other populations declines. importance: multiresistant enterococcus faecium has become  one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, causing increasing numbers of nosocomial infections worldwide. here, we used bayesian population genetic analysis to identify groups of related e. faecium strains and show a significant  association of hospital and farm animal isolates to different genetic groups. we  also found that hospital isolates could be divided into three lineages originating from sequence types (sts) 17, 18, and 78. we propose that, driven by  the selective pressure in hospitals, the three hospital lineages have arisen through horizontal gene transfer, but once adapted to the distinct pathogenic niche, this population has become isolated and recombination with other populations declines. elucidation of the population structure is a prerequisite for effective control of multiresistant e. faecium since it provides insight into the processes that have led to the progressive change of e. faecium from an innocent commensal to a multiresistant hospital-adapted pathogen.

TI  == evidence for occurrence, persistence, and growth potential of escherichia coli and enterococci in hawaii's soil environments.
AB  == high densities of escherichia coli and enterococci are common in freshwaters on oahu and other hawaiian islands. soil along stream banks has long been suspected  as the likely source of these bacteria; however, the extent of their occurrence and distribution in a wide range of soils remained unknown until the current investigation. soil samples representing the seven major soil associations were collected on the island of oahu and analyzed for fecal coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci by the most probable number method. fecal coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci were found in most of the samples analyzed; log mean densities (mpn +/- se g soil(-)(1)) were 1.96 +/- 0.18, n=61; 1.21 +/- 0.17, n=57; and 2.99 +/-  0.12, n=62, respectively. representative, presumptive cultures of e. coli and enterococci collected from the various soils were identified and further speciated using the api scheme; at least six species of enterococcus, including enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, were identified. in mesocosm studies, e. coli and enterococci increased by 100-fold in 4 days, after mixing sewage-spiked soil (one part) with autoclaved soil (nine parts). e. coli remained metabolically active in the soil and readily responded to nutrients, as evidenced by increased dehydrogenase activity. collectively, these findings indicate that populations of e. coli and enterococci are part of the natural soil microflora, potentially influencing the quality of nearby water bodies.

TI  == volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  == approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by gram-positive bacteria. the timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study gram-negative bacteria. here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (imr-ms) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. the detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures  containing e. faecalis. after 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (pca) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. imr-ms in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

AB  == background: enterococci are among the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections in the united states and europe, with enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium being the two most common species isolated from enterococcal infections. in the last decade, the proportion of enterococcal infections caused  by e. faecium has steadily increased compared to other enterococcus species. although the underlying mechanism for the gradual replacement of e. faecalis by e. faecium in the hospital environment is not yet understood, many studies using  genotyping and phylogenetic analysis have shown the emergence of a globally dispersed polyclonal subcluster of e. faecium strains in clinical environments. systematic study of the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of e. faecium has been hindered by the lack of closed, complete e. faecium genomes that can be used as references. results: in this study, we report the complete genome sequence of  the e. faecium strain tx16, also known as do, which belongs to multilocus sequence type (st) 18, and was the first e. faecium strain ever sequenced. whole  genome comparison of the tx16 genome with 21 e. faecium draft genomes confirmed that most clinical, outbreak, and hospital-associated (ha) strains (including sts 16, 17, 18, and 78), in addition to strains of non-hospital origin, group in the  same clade (referred to as the ha clade) and are evolutionally considerably more  closely related to each other by phylogenetic and gene content similarity analyses than to isolates in the community-associated (ca) clade with approximately a 3-4% average nucleotide sequence difference between the two clades at the core genome level. our study also revealed that many genomic loci in the tx16 genome are unique to the ha clade. 380 orfs in tx16 are ha-clade specific and antibiotic resistance genes are enriched in ha-clade strains. mobile elements such as is16 and transposons were also found almost exclusively in ha strains, as previously reported. conclusions: our findings along with other studies show that ha clonal lineages harbor specific genetic elements as well as  sequence differences in the core genome which may confer selection advantages over the more heterogeneous ca e. faecium isolates. which of these differences are important for the success of specific e. faecium lineages in the hospital environment remain(s) to be determined.

TI  == enterococcus faecium stimulates human neutrophils via the formyl-peptide receptor 2.
AB  == the human formyl-peptide receptor 2 (fpr2/alx) senses phenol-soluble modulin (psm) peptide toxins produced by pathogenic staphylococcal species and plays a crucial role in directing neutrophil influx during staphylococcal infection. however, it has remained unclear if fpr2 responds also to molecules from other bacterial pathogens. here we analyzed a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and found that apart from staphylococci only certain enterococcal strains have the capacity to stimulate fpr2/alx. most of the analyzed enterococcus faecium but only sporadic enterococcus faecalis strains released fpr2/alx-stimulating molecules leading to neutrophil calcium ion fluxes, chemotaxis, and complement receptor upregulation. among ten test strains vancomycin-resistant e. faecium had a significantly higher capacity to stimulate  fpr2/alx than vancomycin-susceptible strains, suggesting an association of strong fpr2/alx activation with health-care associated strains. the enterococcal fpr2/alx agonists were found to be peptides or proteins, which appear, however, to be unrelated to staphylococcal psms in sequence and physicochemical properties. enterococci are among the most frequent invasive bacterial pathogens  but the basis of enterococcal virulence and immune activation has remained incompletely understood. our study indicates that previously unrecognized proteinaceous agonists contribute to enterococcus-host interaction and underscores the importance of fpr2/alx in host defense against major endogenous bacterial pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == enterococcus in wound infections: virulence and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == enterococci, a complex group of facultative pathogens have become increasingly isolated in various hospital settings. they are considerable frequently cultured  from traumatic and surgical wounds. we investigated 57 strains of the species e.  faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus isolated from infected wounds. their ability to produce virulence factors and their sensitivity to antibiotics were evaluated using phenotypic and genotyping methods. in the phenotype studies, significant portion of the isolates produced biofilm (66.7%) and gelatinase (36.8%). nearly 30% of the strains expressed hemolytic properties. only a few produced dnase (15.8%) and lipase (7.0%). the genes esp, gele, cyla, cylb, cylm and agg were detected in most of the isolates (38.6-87.7%). all the isolated enterococci were susceptible to vancomycin and were characterized by their low resistance to antibiotics, except aminoglycosides (hlr).

TI  == antibiotic resistance and virulence traits in clinical and environmental enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  == this study compared virulence and antibiotic resistance traits in clinical and environmental enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. e. faecalis isolates harboured a broader spectrum of virulence determinants compared to e. faecium isolates. the virulence traits cyl-a, cyl-b, cyl-m, gel-e, esp and  acm were tested and environmental isolates predominantly harboured gel-e (80% of  e. faecalis and 31.9% of e. faecium) whereas esp was more prevalent in clinical isolates (67.8% of e. faecalis and 70.4% of e. faecium). e. faecalis and e. faecium isolated from water had different antibiotic resistance patterns compared to those isolated from clinical samples. linezolid resistance was not observed in any isolates tested and vancomycin resistance was observed only in clinical isolates. resistance to other antibiotics (tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin) was detected in both clinical and water isolates. clinical isolates were more resistant to all the antibiotics tested compared to water isolates. multi-drug resistance was more prevalent in clinical isolates (71.2% of e. faecalis and 70.3% of e. faecium) compared to water isolates (only 5.7% e. faecium). tet l and tet m genes were predominantly identified in tetracycline-resistant isolates. all water and clinical isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin contained mutations in the gyra, parc and pbp5 genes. a significant correlation was found between the presence of virulence determinants and antibiotic resistance in all the isolates tested in this study (p<0.05). the presence of antibiotic resistant enterococci, together with associated virulence traits, in surface recreational water could be a public health risk.

TI  == reversible monensin adaptation in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens of cattle origin: potential impact on human food safety.
AB  == objectives: to determine the stability/reversibility and mechanism of monensin adaptation in monensin-treated cattle isolates compared with reference bacterial  isolates, exposed in vitro to high monensin concentrations. methods: we evaluated the potential for cattle-origin strains of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis exposed to monensin in vivo (in vivo monensin-exposed isolates) to maintain or achieve the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations (in vitro monensin-adapted isolates). twenty-one consecutive subcultures of the in vitro monensin-adapted strains were  performed, and monensin mics were determined for the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st subcultures (subcultured isolates). sds-page and transmission electron microscopy (tem) were used to determine protein expression and visualize extracellular morphology changes. results: monensin-non-exposed isolates did not display monensin adaptation during in vitro monensin exposure. in contrast, in vivo monensin-exposed isolates displayed monensin adaptation enabling growth at 32x mic. upon consecutive subculturing, monensin mics returned to baseline, or one dilution above, for the monensin-adapted strains. sds-page identified overexpression of a 14 kda protein (c. perfringens) and a 20.5 kda protein (e. faecium and e. faecalis) in the monensin-adapted isolates. tem demonstrated that  in vitro monensin-adapted strains had a significantly thicker cell wall or glycocalyx compared with in vivo monensin-exposed or subcultured isolates. conclusions: in vivo monensin-exposed isolates of c. perfringens, e. faecium and  e. faecalis have the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations in vitro. this is associated with an increased thickening of the cell wall or glycocalyx that is reversible upon serial passage, suggesting a phenotypically expressed, but not genetically stable, trait.

TI  == the variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  == objectives: this study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. the evaluation was based on the determined levels of  bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. materials and methods: the study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. the air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at  the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a gilair 5 (sensidyne, usa) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (whatman, uk). for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. results:  the total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). for gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). the concentrations of the cocci of enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). the lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the  buildings). the lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. gram-positive bacteria of the genera: staphylococcus, enterococcus, corynebacterium, brevibacterium, micrococcus, cellulomonas, bacillus, aerococcus, and gram-negative bacteria of the genera: pseudomonas, moraxella, escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, pasteurella, pantoea were isolated. it was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. they should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when  the gates in the hen houses are closed.

TI  == evaluation of species-specific pcr, bruker ms, vitek ms and the vitek 2 system for the identification of clinical enterococcus isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the performance of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phenotypic identification systems for the identification of enterococcus species. a total of 132 clinical isolates were investigated by the following: (1) a multiplex real-time pcr assay targeting ddl enterococcus faecium, ddl enterococcus faecalis, vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genes, and a high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of the groesl gene for the differentiation of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum; (2) bruker ms; (3) vitek ms; and (4) the vitek 2 system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used as a reference method in the study. the 132 isolates were identified as 32 e. faecalis, 63 e. faecium, 16  e. casseliflavus and 21 e. gallinarum. the multiplex pcr, bruker ms and vitek ms  were able to identify all the isolates correctly at the species level. the vitek  2 system could identify 131/132 (99.2 %) and 121/132 (91.7 %) of the isolates at  the genus and species levels, respectively. the hrm-groesl assay identified all (21/21) e. gallinarum isolates and 81.3 % (13/16) of the e. casseliflavus isolates. the pcr methods described in the present study are effective in identifying the enterococcal species. maldi-tof ms is a rapid, reliable and cost-effective identification technique for enterococci. the vitek 2 system is less efficient at detecting non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococcus species.

TI  == abundance of enterococcus species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, essential indicators of fecal pollution, in river water.
AB  == enterococci such as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium are considered as the most suitable indicators of fecal pollution in an aquatic environment, and new methods for enterococcus determination have been developed, namely, membrane filtration (mf) using membrane-enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside agar (mei) and defined substrate technology (dst) using enterolert(r). this study used pcr analysis to identify e. faecalis and e. faecium among enterococcus strains in river water isolated using both mei plates and enterolert(r) trays. there was a significantly high correlation between mf and dst in terms of enterococcal counts for river water samples. the combined percentages of e. faecalis and e. faecium with respect to the total number of all strains obtained using mei plates and enterolert(r) trays were approximately 30 % and >30 %, respectively. other than e. faecalis and e. faecium, a large number of enterococcus species were unspecified in the actual urban river samples. a comparison of the predominance of e. faecalis and e. faecium found that the abundance of a species depended on the sampling river and date. e. faecium is a non-predominant species in intestinal and fecal enterococci, and it was one of the main enterococcus species detected in surface water.

AB  == enterococci are important pathogens causing nosocomial infections and patients at risk include also premature babies requiring intensive care treatment. our aim was to assess occurrence and cross transmission rates of enterococci among neonatal patients of a hospital ward during a two months period. rectal and skin  samples were taken between day one and 60 of infants' age. colonization with various potentially pathogenic bacteria was correlated with developing a subsequent infection. enterococcal isolates were identified by colony morphology. the bacterial species was assessed and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined. a molecular analysis of 20 investigated enterococcal isolates revealed prevalence of commensal strain types; hospital-associated strain types or multi-resistant variants were absent. cross transmission of e. faecium and e.  faecalis isolates among neonatal patients attending the intensive crare unit at the same time was demonstrable. introduction of hospital-associated, multi-resistant variants into this special setting has to be avoided to reduce the risk of subsequent infections.

TI  == correlation between mutations in liafsr of enterococcus faecium and mic of daptomycin: revisiting daptomycin breakpoints.
AB  == mutations in liafsr, a three-component regulatory system controlling cell-envelope stress response, were recently linked with the emergence of daptomycin (dap) resistance in enterococci. our previous work showed that a liaf  mutation increased the dap mic of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain from 1 to 3 mug/ml (the dap breakpoint is 4 mug/ml), suggesting that mutations in the liafsr system could be a pivotal initial event in the development of dap resistance. with the hypothesis that clinical enterococcal isolates with dap mics between 3 and 4 mug/ml might harbor mutations in liafsr, we studied 38 enterococcus faecium bloodstream isolates, of which 8 had dap mics  between 3 and 4 mug/ml by etest in mueller-hinton agar. interestingly, 6 of these 8 isolates had predicted amino acid changes in the liafsr system. moreover, we previously showed that among 6 dap-resistant e. faecium isolates (mics of >4 mug/ml), 5 had mutations in liafsr. in contrast, none of 16 e. faecium isolates with a dap mic of </=2 mug/ml harbored mutations in this system (p < 0.0001). all but one isolate with liafsr changes exhibited dap mics of >/=16 mug/ml by etest using brain heart infusion agar (bhia), a medium that better supports enterococcal growth. our findings provide a strong association between dap mics within the upper susceptibility range and mutations in the liafsr system. concomitant susceptibility testing on bhia may be useful for identifying these e. faecium first-step mutants. our results also suggest that the current dap breakpoint for e. faecium may need to be reevaluated.

TI  == enterococcal endocarditis: can we win the war?
AB  == treatment of enterococcal infections has long been recognized as an important clinical challenge, particularly in the setting of infective endocarditis (ie). furthermore, the increase prevalence of isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance  (mdr) to traditional anti-enterococcal antibiotics such as ampicillin, vancomycin and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance) poses immense therapeutic dilemmas in hospitals around the world. unlike ie caused by most isolates of enterococcus faecalis, which still retain susceptibility to ampicillin and vancomycin, the emergence and dissemination of a hospital-associated genetic clade of multidrug resistant enterococcus faecium, markedly limits the therapeutic options. the best treatment of ie mdr enterococcal endocarditis is unknown and the paucity of antibiotics with bactericidal activity against these organisms is a cause of serious concern. although it appears that we are winning the war against e. faecalis, the battle rages on against isolates of multidrug-resistant e. faecium.

AB  == in order to develop a typing and identification method for van gene containing enterococcus faecium, two multiplex pcr reactions were developed for use in hrm-pcr (high resolution melt-pcr): (i) vana, vanb, vanc, vanc23 to detect van genes from different enterococcus species; (ii) isr (intergenic spacer region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes) to detect all enterococcus species and obtain species and isolate specific hrm curves. to test and validate the method three groups of isolates were tested: (i) 1672 enterococcus species isolates from january 2009 to december 2009; (ii) 71 isolates previously identified and typed by pfge (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) and mlst (multi-locus sequence typing); and (iii) 18 of the isolates from (i) for which isr sequencing was done. as well as successfully identifying 2 common genotypes by hrm from the austin hospital clinical isolates, this study analysed the sequences of all the vanb genes deposited in genbank and developed a numerical classification scheme for the standardised naming of these vanb genotypes. the identification of enterococcus faecalis from e. faecium was reliable and stable using isr pcr. the  typing of e. faecium by isr pcr: (i) detected two variable peaks corresponding to different copy numbers of insertion sequences i and ii corresponding to peak i and ii respectively; (ii) produced 7 melt profiles for e. faecium with variable copy numbers of sequences i and ii; (iii) demonstrated stability and instability  of peak heights with equal frequency within the patient sample (36.4+/-4.5 days and 38.6+/-5.8 days respectively for 192 patients); (iv) detected isr-hrm types with as much discrimination as pfge and more than mlst; and (v) detected isr-hrm  types that differentiated some isolates that were identical by pfge and mlst. in  conjunction with the rapid and accurate van genotyping method described here, this isr-hrm typing and identification method can be used as a stable identification and typing method with predictable instability based on recombination and concerted evolution of the rrn operon that will complement existing typing methods.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of bacteriocins in enterococcal isolates of different sources.
AB  == a collection of 57 enterococcal isolates from different origin (including river,  treatment plant, spring and garbage water, soil, animal, and vegetables from aydin) was screened for the production of bacteriocins. enterococci were identified at species levels as enterococcus faecium (34), e. hirae (6), e. casseliflavus (4), e. durans (4), e. faecalis (4), e. mundtii (3) and e. avium (2). of the 57 isolates 40 of them inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. based on our pcr results 54 strains possesed enterocin genes. the genes of enta and entb were the most frequently detected structural genes among the pcr positive strains (54 and 53 strains, respectively) and the entb gene was  always associated with enta gene. the highest combination of enterocin genes (24  of 54 strains) detected was enta, entb, entp and entl50a/b. the enterocins as-48  and cyll(ls) genes were not found. three enterococcal isolates, 2 e. faecium and  1 e. hirae were not harbour any of tested enterocin genes. no correlation between the presence of enterocin structural genes and the origin of the strain was detected, also no relationship seemed to exist between the tested enterocin genes and the activity spectra of isolates. genes encoding bacteriocins are widely disseminated among enterocci from different origin and more studies should be done for evaluate industrial potential of bacteriocins. electronic supplementary  material: the online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0143-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

TI  == detection of vana-containing enterococcus species in faecal microbiota of gilthead seabream (sparus aurata).
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and e. durans isolates with the genotype vana were detected in 7 of 118 faecal samples (5.9%) of natural gilthead seabream recovered off the coast of portugal, and one vancomycin-resistant isolate/sample was further characterized. the genes erm(b),  tet(l), tet(m), aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iiia and/or ant(6)-ia were identified in most of the 7 vancomycin-resistant enterococci. sequence types st273, st313 and st76 were detected in three e. faecium isolates and st6 in two e. faecalis isolates. vana-containing enterococci are suggested to be disseminated in fish in marine ecosystems close to areas of human activity.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolates isolated in rajavithi hospital between 1999 and 2009.
AB  == from 1999 to 2009, a total of 10,470 clinical enterococcal strains from patients  in rajavithi hospital were isolated. of these, 201 (1.9%) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) including 199 (99.0%) enterococcus faecium and 2 (1.00%) enterococcus faecalis were found. the incidence of vre was 1.8% in 1999, 3.3% in  2000, 5.1% in 2001, 1.0% in 2002, 0.0% in 2003 and 2004, 1.1% in 2005, 4.7% in 2006, 1.9% in 2007, 2.2% in 2008 and 0.9% in 2009. seventy-one vre isolates were  classified to vana phenotype (69 vana e. faecium and 2 vana e. faecalis) and 130  were classified to vanb phenotype (vanb e. faecium). the rate of inpatient departments (ipd)-associated vre (199 (99.0%) vre isolates) was significantly greater than the incidence of outpatient departments (opd)-vre (2 (1.0%) vre isolates). vre were found in medical (33.7%), icus (15.6%) and surgical (15.1%) wards. vre were mostly found in urine, 64.2%, following in pus, blood, genital and sputum specimens, 21.9%, 9.0%, 3.5% and 1.4%, respectively. vre, especially vancomycin resistant e. faecium, were multidrug-resistant (resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and gentamicin). all strains of vre were fully susceptible to linezolid.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of antibiotic resistant enterococcus faecalis in  french cheeses.
AB  == prevalence of enterococci and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococcus faecalis was analyzed in 126 french cheeses from retail stores. forty-four percent of pasteurized or thermised-milk cheeses, and up to 92% of raw-milk cheeses contained detectable enterococci. a total of 337 antibiotic resistant enterococci were isolated in 29% and 60% of pasteurized-milk and raw-milk cheeses, respectively. e. faecalis was the predominant antibiotic resistant species recovered (81%), followed by enterococcus faecium (13%), and enterococcus durans (6%). the most prevalent antibiotic resistances were tetracycline (tet) and minocycline (min), followed by erythromycin (ery), kanamycin (kan) and chloramphenicol (cm). the most common multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype was cm ery kan min tet. the occurrence of antibiotic genes, as searched by pcr, was 100 % for aph3'iiia, 96 % for ermb, 90 % for tetm and 80 % for cata in isolates resistant to kan, ery, tet or cm, respectively. mlst analysis of 30 multidrug resistant e. faecalis revealed that st19, cc21, cc25 and cc55 isolates  were the most common in cheeses. in conclusion, as in many other european countries, french cheeses do contain enterococci with multiple antibiotics resistances. however, low occurrence of high-level gentamicin resistant or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant enterococci and absence of vancomycin- or ampicillin- resistant enterococci indicate that cheeses cannot be considered as a major reservoir for nosocomial multi-drug resistant enterococci.

TI  == speciation and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from recreational beaches in malaysia.
AB  == we report the first study on the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in coastal bathing waters in malaysia. one hundred and sixty-five enterococci isolates recovered from two popular recreational beaches in malaysia were speciated and screened for antibiotic resistance to a total of eight antibiotics. prevalence of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium was highest in both  beaches. e. faecalis/e. faecium ratio was 0.384:1 and 0.375:1, respectively, for  isolates from port dickson (pd) and bagan lalang (bl). analysis of fisher's exact test showed that association of prevalence of e. faecalis and e. faecium with considered locations was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). chi-square test revealed significant differences (chi(2) = 82.630, df = 20, p < 0.001) in the frequency of occurrence of enterococci isolates from the considered sites. resistance was highest to nalidixic acid (94.84 %) and least for chloramphenicol  (8.38 %). one-way anova using tukey-kramer multiple comparison test showed that resistance to ampicillin was higher in pd beach isolates than bl isolates and the difference was extremely statistically significant (p < 0.0001). frequency of occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) isolates were higher for pd beach water (64.29 %) as compared to bl beach water (13.51 %), while mar indices  ranged between 0.198 and 0.48. the results suggest that samples from port dickson may contain mar bacteria and that this could be due to high-risk faecal contamination from sewage discharge pipes that drain into the sea water.

TI  == speciation and frequency of virulence genes of enterococcus spp. isolated from rainwater tank samples in southeast queensland, australia.
AB  == in this study, 212 enterococcus isolates from 23 rainwater tank samples in southeast queensland (seq), australia were identified to the species level. the isolates were also tested for the presence of 6 virulence genes associated with enterococcus related infections. among the 23 rainwater tank samples, 20 (90%), 10 (44%), 7 (30%), 5 (22%), 4 (17%), 2 (9%), and 1 (4%) samples yielded e. faecalis, e. mundtii, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. avium, and e. durans, respectively. among the 6 virulence genes tested, gele and efaa were most prevalent, detected in 19 (83%) and 18 (78%) of 23 rainwater tank samples, respectively. virulence gene ace was also detected in 14 (61%) rainwater tank samples followed by as, esp (e. faecalis variant), and cyla genes which were detected in 3 (13%), 2 (9%), and 1 (4%) samples, respectively. in all, 120 (57%)  enterococcus isolates from 20 rainwater tank samples harbored virulence genes. among these tank water samples, enterococcus spp. from 5 (25%) samples harbored a single virulence gene and 15 (75%) samples were harboring two or more virulence genes. the significance of these strains in terms of health implications remains  to be assessed. the potential sources of these strains need to be identified for  the improved management of captured rainwater quality. finally, it is recommended that enterococcus spp. should be used as an additional fecal indicator bacterium  in conjunction with e. coli for the microbiological assessment of rainwater tanks.

TI  == survey of virulence determinants among vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients of north west of iran.
AB  == recent data indicates an increasing rate of vancomycin resistance in clinical enterococcal isolates worldwide. the nosocomial enterococci are likely to harbor  virulence elements that increase their ability to colonize hospitalized patients. the aim of this study was to characterize virulence determinants in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) obtained from various clinical sources.during the years 2008 to 2010, a total of 48 vre isolates were obtained from three university teaching hospitals in northwest, iran. initially, phenotypic speciation was done and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of vancomycin were determined by agar dilution method and e-test. then, species identification and resistance genotypes along with detection of virulence genes (asa1, esp, gele, ace and cpd) of the isolates were performed by multiplex pcr.thirty eight isolates were identified as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrefm) and ten as e. faecalis (vrefs). irrespective of the species, vana gene (89.58%) was dominant and three phenotypically vancomycin susceptible e. faecium isolates carried the vanb gene. among virulence genes investigated, the esp was found in 27(71%) vrefm strains, but did not in any vrefs. other virulence determinants were highly detected in vrefs strains. our data indicate a high prevalence of e. faecium harboring vancomycin resistance with vana genotype and the two vre species displayed different virulence genes.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of enterococcus sp. isolated in a university hospital in algeria.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of enterococci isolated from infections at an algerian university hospital, and to evaluate the  prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and the clonal cluster present in this country. methods: patients who presented at annaba university hospital with enterococcus infections were prospectively included over a 1-y period (2010). all enterococcus sp. isolated were characterized by antibiotic resistance, van and erm genes, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst), and virulence genes. results: a total of 125 enterococcus isolates recovered from 125 patients (59% female; median age 54 y, range 2-86 y) were studied. no differences in epidemiological data were observed between infections by enterococcus faecalis vs enterococcus faecium. however a high proportion of e. faecium were resistant to ampicillin (95%). the prevalence of vre, corresponding to 4 vanc1-enterococcus gallinarum, was 3.2%. a high level of genomic diversity among strains was noted,  with the importance of sequence type (st) 78 (which belongs to clonal complex (cc) 17) in e. faecium and st317 and cc2 in e. faecalis. conclusions: this first  study on enterococci isolated in algeria shows the low prevalence of vre, but the presence of clonal complexes linked to vre and vancomycin-sensitive enterococci associated with hospital infections. moreover the high level of macrolide resistance and/or ampicillin resistance in e. faecium suggests close monitoring of the epidemiology of these strains.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediments from a coastal fish farm.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect and characterize antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediment from a mediterranean aquaculture site where  no antibiotics are used. colonies (650) grown on slanetz-bartley (sb) agar were amplified on antibiotic-supplemented sb, and erythromycin (ery), tetracycline (tet), and ampicillin (amp) mics were determined. of 75 resistant isolates (17 to tet, 5 to ery, and 45 to amp), 5 enterococcus faecalis, 25 e. faecium, 5 e. casseliflavus, 1 e. gallinarum, 1 e. durans, and 23 enterococcus spp. were identified by genus- and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr). tet(m), tet(o), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), erm(a), erm(c), mef, msr, blaz, and int(tn916) were sought by pcr, including an improved multiplex pcr assay targeting tet(m), tet(l), and erm(b). tet(m) was the most frequent tet resistance gene; msr(c) was the sole ery resistance gene detected. blaz was found in 29/45 amp-resistant isolates; however, no beta-lactamase production was detected. antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2 km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. the occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. this first evidence of resistant enterococci at a mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir  of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.

AB  == objectives: outbreaks caused by linezolid-resistant (lr) enterococci remain rare. we report the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the multiclonal dissemination of lr enterococci in the intensive care unit (icu) of a greek hospital. methods: all lr enterococcal isolates recovered from patients hospitalized in the icu of the university hospital of larissa, greece, between january 2007 and october 2008 were included. isolates were tested by pfge and pcr followed by sequence analysis of the entire 23s rrna gene. patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition and outcome. results: sixteen separate patients were infected and/or colonized by 22 lr enterococcal isolates (17 enterococcus faecium and 5 enterococcus faecalis). linezolid mics varied from 8 to 16 mg/l; 12 isolates showed cross-resistance to vancomycin. genotyping revealed as many as seven and three pfge types among e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates, respectively, indicating multiclonal spread of lr enterococci. nine patients had received linezolid prior to the recovery of lr enterococci, while the remaining seven patients were not exposed to the drug. all isolates carried the mutation g2576t; the mutated position was heterogeneous in 12 isolates and homogeneous in 10. conclusions: the multiclonal composition of lr enterococci indicates that linezolid resistance possibly occurred on several independent occasions. its acquisition was often not related to linezolid administration; patients might have acquired their lr isolate from another patient that had received linezolid or, alternatively, resistance may have arisen by mutation that occurred independently.

TI  == presence of the resistance genes vanc1 and pbp5 in phenotypically vancomycin and  ampicillin susceptible enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == ampicillin and vancomycin are important antibiotics for the therapy of enterococcus faecalis infections. the ampicillin resistance gene pbp5 is intrinsic in enterococcus faecium. the vanc1 gene confers resistance to vancomycin and serves as a species marker for enterococcus gallinarum. both genes are chromosomally located. resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin was determined in 484 e. faecalis of human and porcine origin by microdilution. since e. faecalis are highly skilled to acquire resistance genes, all strains were investigated for the presence of pbp5 (and, in positive strains, for the penicillin-binding protein synthesis repressor gene psr) and vanc1 (and, in positive strains, for vanxyc and vant) by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  one porcine and one human isolate were phenotypically resistant to ampicillin; no strain was vancomycin resistant. four e. faecalis (3/1 of porcine/human origin) carried pbp5 (mic=1 mg/l), and four porcine strains were vanc1 positive (minimum  inhibitory concentration [mic]=1 mg/l). real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr  revealed that the genes were not expressed. the psr gene was absent in the four pbp5-positive strains; the vanxyc gene was absent in the four vanc1-positive strains. however, vant of the vanc gene cluster was detected in two vanc1-positive strains. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of pbp5, identical with the "e. faecium pbp5 gene," and of vanc1/vant in e. faecalis. even if resistance is not expressed in these strains, this study shows that e. faecalis have a strong ability to acquire resistance genes-and potentially to spread them to other bacteria. therefore, close monitoring of this species should be continued.

TI  == characterization of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in enterococcus  spp. isolated from retail meats in alberta, canada.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize antimicrobial resistance (amr) and virulence genotypes of enterococcus spp. particularly enterococcus faecalis isolated from retail meats purchased (2007-2008) in alberta, canada. unconditional statistical associations between amr pheno- and genotypes and virulence genotypes were determined. a total of 532 enterococci comprising one isolate from each positive sample were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility. a customized enterococcal microarray was used for species identification and the  detection of amr and virulence genes. e. faecalis was found in >94% of poultry samples and in about 73% of beef and 86% of pork samples. enterococcus faecium was not found in turkey meat and its prevalence was 2% in beef and pork and 4% in chicken samples. none of the enterococci isolates were resistant to the clinically important drugs ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, linezolid and vancomycin. multiresistance (>/=3 antimicrobials) was more common in e. faecalis (91%) isolated from chicken and turkey (91%) than those isolated from beef (14%) or pork (45%). resistance to aminoglycosides was also noted at varying degrees. the  most common resistance genes found in e. faecalis were aminoglycosides (aac, apha3, aade, sat4, aada), macrolides (ermb, erma), tetracyclines (tetm, tetl, teto), streptogramin (vate), bacitracin (bcrr) and lincosamide (linb). virulence  genes expressing aggregation substances (agg) and cytolysin (cyla, cylb, cyll, cylm) were found more frequently in poultry e. faecalis and were unconditionally  associated with tetm, linb and bcrr resistance genes. other virulence genes coding for adhesion (ace, efaafs), gelatinase (gele) were also found in the majority of e. faecalis. significant statistical associations were found between  resistance and virulence genotypes, suggesting their possible physical link on a  common genetic element. this study underscores the importance of e. faecalis as a reservoir of resistance and virulence genes and their potential transfer to humans through consumption of contaminated undercooked meat.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid due to cfr in a human clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == nonmutational resistance to linezolid is due to the presence of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase responsible for methylation of a2503 in the 23s rrna. the cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of enterococcus faecalis from china. here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant e. faecalis (603-50427x) recovered from a patient in thailand who received prolonged therapy  with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. the isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23s rrna and l3 and l4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (mlst) 16 (st16), which is  commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an ~97-kb transferable plasmid. the cfr gene environment exhibited dna sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100%). the cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of e. faecalis (og1rf) but not to enterococcus faecium or  s. aureus. the cfr gene was flanked by is256-like sequences both upstream and downstream. this is the first characterization of the potential horizontal transferability of the cfr gene from a human linezolid-resistant isolate of e. faecalis.

TI  == enterococci of animal origin and their significance for public health.
AB  == enterococci are commensal bacteria in the intestines of humans and animals, but also cause infections in humans. most often, enterococcus faecium isolates from clinical outbreaks belong to different types than e. faecium from animals, food,  and humans in the community. the same variants of the vana gene cluster (tn1546)  encoding vancomycin resistance can be detected in enterococci of both human and animal origin. this could indicate horizontal transfer of tn1546 between enterococci of different origin. e. faecium isolates of animal origin might not constitute a human hazard in themselves, but they could act as donors of antimicrobial resistance genes for other pathogenic enterococci. enterococcus faecalis of animal origin seems to be a human hazard, as the same types can be detected in e. faecalis from animals, meat, faecal samples from humans in the community, and patients with bloodstream infections.

TI  == evaluation of standard- and high-dose daptomycin versus linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  == daptomycin mics for enterococci are typically 1- to 2-fold higher than those for  staphylococcus aureus, and there is an imminent need to establish the optimal dose for appropriate treatment of enterococcal infections. we investigated the bactericidal activity of daptomycin at various dose exposures compared to that of linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model utilizing simulated endocardial vegetations over 96 h. daptomycin at doses of 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg of body weight/day and linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h were evaluated against two clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains (efm11499 and 09-184d1051), one of which was linezolid resistant (09-184d1051), and one clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain (efs11496). daptomycin mics were 4, 2, and 0.5 mug/ml for efm11499, 09-184d1051, and efs11496, respectively.  bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log(10) cfu/g reduction from the initial colony count, was demonstrated against all three isolates with all doses  of daptomycin; however, bactericidal activity was not sustained with the daptomycin 6- and 8-mg/kg/day regimens. linezolid was bacteriostatic against efm11499 and displayed no appreciable activity against 09-184d1051 or efs11496. concentration-dependent killing was displayed with more sustained reduction in colony count (3.58 to 6.46 and 5.89 to 6.56 log(10) cfu/g) at 96 h for the simulated regimen of daptomycin at doses of 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (p  </= 0.012). no e. faecium mutants with reduced susceptibility were recovered at any dosage regimen; however, the e. faecalis strain developed reduced daptomycin  susceptibility with daptomycin at 6, 8, and 10 but not at 12 mg/kg/day. daptomycin displayed a dose-dependent response against three vre isolates, with high-dose daptomycin producing sustained bactericidal activity. further research  is warranted.

TI  == differences in biofilm formation and virulence factors between clinical and fecal enterococcal isolates of human and animal origin.
AB  == the present study investigated the possible correlation between carriage of the virulence genes esp and fsrb, production of hemolysin and gelatinase and biofilm  formation in human vs. animal enterococcal isolates. a collection of 219 enterococcal isolates recovered from clinical and fecal surveillance samples of hospitalized patients and 132 isolates from animal feces were studied. isolates were tested for hemolysin and gelatinase phenotypically and for quantitative biofilm production by a microtitre method. genes esp and fsrb were detected by pcr. human enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates from both surveillance and clinical samples produced biofilm significantly more often than  animal isolates (p < 0.0001 for both species). the quantity of biofilm did not differ significantly between human and animal isolates, while was significantly higher in esp-positive compared with esp-negative human e. faecium isolates (p <  0.0001). the frequency of esp gene carriage was significantly higher in human compared with animal e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates (p < 0.0001). the gene fsrb was detected significantly more often in animal than human e. faecium isolates (p 0.004). hemolysin production was significantly more common in human clinical compared with animal e. faecalis isolates (p < 0.0001). similar proportions of animal and human e. faecalis produced gelatinase, which was significantly correlated with the presence of fsrb gene (p < 0.0001) in both human clinical and animal e. faecalis isolates. the hemolysin trait did not exhibit any correlation with the presence of esp and fsrb genes, but appeared to  be linked with enhanced quantity of biofilm production in both human clinical and animal e. faecalis isolates. production of gelatinase was associated with the proportion and the degree of biofilm production mainly in animal e. faecalis isolates.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. the commonest causative bacteria are staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high csf drug levels by intravenous administration. recently, three cases of s. epidermidis csf shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. a continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant  [mrsa and mrse]), enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. they were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in csf for 14 days. the biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for  regrowth. enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. no resistance was seen. linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both s. epidermidis (mrse) and s. aureus (mrsa). neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. it is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.

TI  == [antibiotic treatment of enterococcal infections in gastroenterology with daptomycin - first experiences from the eu-core registry study (european cubicin(r) outcomes registry and experience)].
AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in gastroenterology. the increase of enterococcus faecium infections with development of resistance to gentamicin and vancomycin as well as possible linezolid resistance require alternative antibiotic therapies. study data show that daptomycin, a highly bactericidal antibiotic is effective in enterococcal infections. however, in germany daptomycin is so far only approved for the treatment of complicated skin  and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by staphylococcus aureus. in the department of internal medicine i, university hospital halle (saale) from may 2 009 to april 2 010 all gastroenterological patients with evidence of invasive enterococcal infection received intravenous daptomycin treatment at inclusion in the european cubicin(r) outcomes registry and experience (eu-core). gastroenterological diseases treated were necrotising pancreatitis, infected pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, obstructive cholangitis and sepsis. the clinical outcome was retrospectively detected by protocol-defined criteria. a total of 13 patients (8 male, 5 female, median age 59 years) with microbiologically assured enterococcal infections (10 x e. faecium, including 1 x vre, 6 x e. faecalis, including double infections) were treated with intravenous  daptomycin (6 mg per kg body weight). in the presence of polymicrobial infections (10 of 13 patients), an additional anti-infective therapy was initiated according to sensitivity testing. concomitantly a direct focus approach with stenting, puncture or drainage was performed. the clinical cure rate was 92 % (12 of 13 patients). one patient died from a non-surgically uncontrollable malignancy (klatskin tumour bismuth iiib). there were no adverse events. these results allow us to conclude that antibiotic therapy with daptomycin in invasive or bacteraemic enterococcal infections leads to high cure rates (up to 90 % and more) when concomitant and adequate focus relief is performed. larger clinical studies to obtain an extended drug approval are desirable.

TI  == a comparison of box-pcr and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine genetic relatedness of enterococci from different environments.
AB  == genetic relatedness of enterococci from poultry litter to enterococci from nearby surface water and groundwater in the lower fraser valley regions of british columbia, canada was determined. a new automated box-pcr and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) were used to subtype enterococcal isolates from broiler and layer litter and surface and groundwater. all surface water samples (n = 12)  were positive for enterococci, as were 11% (3/28) of groundwater samples. enterococcus faecium (n = 90) was isolated from all sources, while enterococcus faecalis (n = 59) was isolated from all sources except layer litter. the majority of e. faecalis originated from broiler litter (28/59; 47.5%) while the majority of e. faecium were isolated from layer litter (29/90; 32.2%). e. faecalis grouped primarily by source using box-pcr. isolates from water samples were dispersed more frequently among pfge groups containing isolates from poultry litter. e. faecium strains were genetically diverse as overall clustering was independent of source by both molecular methods. subgroups of e. faecium isolates based upon source (layer litter) were present in box-pcr groups. three individual e. faecalis groups and two individual e. faecium groups were 100% similar using box-pcr; only one instance of 100% similarity among isolates using pfge was observed. although enterococci from litter and water sources were grouped together using box-pcr and pfge, isolates originating from water could not be definitively identified as originating from poultry litter. automation of box-pcr amplicon separation and visualization increased the reproducibility and standardization of subtyping using this procedure.

TI  == virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility in enterococci isolated from oral mucosal and deep infections.
AB  == objective: this study evaluates the presence of virulence factors and antibiotic  susceptibility among enterococcal isolates from oral mucosal and deep infections. methods: forty-three enterococcal strains from oral mucosal lesions and 18 from deep infections were isolated from 830 samples that were sent during 2 years to oral microbiology, university of gothenburg, for analysis. the 61 strains were identified by 16s rdna, and characterized by the presence of the virulence genes  efa a (endocarditis gene), gel e (gelatinase gene), ace (collagen binding antigen gene), asa (aggregation substance gene), cyl a (cytolysin activator gene) and esp (surface adhesin gene), tested for the production of bacteriocins and presence of plasmids. mic determination was performed using the e-test method against the most commonly used antibiotics in dentistry, for example, penicillin v, amoxicillin and clindamycin. vancomycin was included in order to detect vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) strains. results: sixty strains were identified as enterococcus faecalis and one as enterococcus faecium. all the virulence genes were detected in more than 93.3% (efa a and esp) of the e. faecalis strains, while the presence of phenotypic characteristics was much lower (gelatinase 10% and hemolysin 16.7%). forty-six strains produced bacteriocins and one to six plasmids were detected in half of the isolates. conclusions: enterococcal strains from oral infections had a high virulence capacity, showed bacteriocin production and had numerous plasmids. they were generally susceptible to ampicillins but were resistant to clindamycin, commonly used in dentistry, and no vre-strain was found.

TI  == resident cats in small animal veterinary hospitals carry multi-drug resistant enterococci and are likely involved in cross-contamination of the hospital environment.
AB  == in the usa, small animal veterinary hospitals (savhs) commonly keep resident cats living permanently as pets within their facilities. previously, multi-drug resistant (mdr) enterococci were found as a contaminant of multiple surfaces within such veterinary hospitals, and nosocomial infections are a concern. the objectives of this study were to determine whether resident cats carry mdr enterococci and to compare the feline isolates genotypically to those obtained from savh surfaces in a previous study. enterococcal strains (n = 180) were isolated from the feces of six healthy resident cats from different savhs. the concentration of enterococci ranged from 1.1 x 10(5) to 6.0 x 10(8) cfu g(-1) of  feces, and the population comprised enterococcus hirae (38.3 +/- 18.6%), e. faecium (35.0 +/- 14.3%), e. faecalis (23.9 +/- 11.0%), and e. avium (2.8 +/- 2.2%). testing of phenotypic resistance to 14 antimicrobial agents revealed multi-drug resistance (>/=3 antimicrobials) in 48.9% of all enterococcal isolates with most frequent resistance to tetracycline (75.0%), erythromycin (50.0%), and  rifampicin (36.1%). vancomycin resistant e. faecalis (3.9%) with vanb not horizontally transferable in in vitro conjugation assays were detected from one cat. genotyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated a host-specific clonal population of mdr e. faecalis and e. faecium. importantly, several feline isolates were genotypically identical or closely related to isolates from surfaces of cage door, thermometer, and stethoscope of the corresponding savhs. these data demonstrate that healthy resident cats at savhs carry mdr enterococci and likely contribute to contamination of the savh environment. proper disposal and handling of fecal material and restricted movement of resident cats within the ward are recommended.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of multidrug-resistant enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == purpose: vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) pose an emerging problem in hospitals worldwide. the present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence, species prevalence, antibacterial resistance, and phenotypic and genetic characteristics of vre isolated in riyadh hospitals, ksa. materials and methods: two hundred and six isolates of enterococcal species were obtained from  clinical samples. the antibiotic susceptibility of isolates and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) tests for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined. molecular typing of vre isolates was carried out by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and the resistance genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: vre accounted for 3.9% of the isolates  and were detected mostly in urine, wound and blood specimens isolated from icu, internal medicine and surgical wards. all strains were identified to species level and were found to consist of e. faecalis (69.2%), e. faecium (11.3%), e. avium (2.1%), e. hirae (0.8%), e. casseliflavus (1.3%) and e. gallinarum (1.3%) species. according to the susceptibility data obtained, 8 (3.9%) out of 206 isolates were found to be vre (mics > 32 mug/ml). the vana, vanb and vanc gene fragments of e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. gallinarum were amplified from isolates and were detected. pfge patterns of the vre isolates revealed homogenous patterns with dominant clone suggesting that the strains intrinsic resistance is  independent. conclusions: this study shows an emergence of vre along with increased rate of multidrug-resistant enterococci in the area of the study. regular surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities should be done regularly and the risk factors should be determined.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic bases for resistance of infection-causing enterococcus strains in cuba].
AB  == objective: to identify infection-causing enterococcus species in cuban hospitals  and determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs, as well as their resistance mechanisms. methods: a total of 687 enterococcus isolates from 30 cuban hospitals in nine provinces of the country were studied over the period 2000-2009. the species were identified using both the conventional method and the automatic api((r)) system. the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for 13 antimicrobial drugs following the standards recommended by the clinical laboratory and standards institute. the polymerase chain reaction technique was used to characterize the genes that were resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, tetracycline, and glucopeptides. the presence of beta-lactamase was determined by the chromogenic cephalosporin test. results: the most prevalent species were enterococcus faecalis (82.9%) and e. faecium (12.2%). resistance to  glucopeptides (1.0%) was mediated by the vana and vanb genes. the strains resistant to ampicillin (6%) did not produce beta-lactamases. a high percentage of resistance to aminoglycosides was observed. gentamicin (31.0%) and streptomycin and amikacin (29.1%) were mediated by the aac(6')ie-aph(2")ia, aph(3')-iiia, ant(6)ia, and ant(3")(9) genes. a correlation was found between resistance to tetracycline (56.0%) and presence of the tet(m) (75.1%) and tet(l)  genes (7.0%), while resistance to erythromycin (34.1%) was due to the erm(b) gene (70.9%). conclusions: resistance to vancomycin is infrequent in cuba, as opposed  to a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides, which may be indicative of treatment failures. the microbiology laboratory is a cornerstone of enterococcus  infection surveillance, along with ongoing monitoring of the susceptibility of these infections to antimicrobial drugs at a time when resistance of this microorganism is on the rise.

TI  == comparative genomics of enterococci: variation in enterococcus faecalis, clade structure in e. faecium, and defining characteristics of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus.
AB  == the enterococci are gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of diverse hosts. however, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis have emerged as leading causes of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired  infections. the mechanism by which a well-adapted commensal evolved into a hospital pathogen is poorly understood. in this study, we examined high-quality draft genome data for evidence of key events in the evolution of the leading causes of enterococcal infections, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum. we characterized two clades within what is currently classified as e. faecium and identified traits characteristic of each,  including variation in operons for cell wall carbohydrate and putative capsule biosynthesis. we examined the extent of recombination between the two e. faecium  clades and identified two strains with mosaic genomes. we determined the underlying genetics for the defining characteristics of the motile enterococci e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. further, we identified species-specific traits that could be used to advance the detection of medically relevant enterococci and their identification to the species level.

AB  == in published studies, cohorts of patients with bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) have predominantly been infected with enterococcus faecium. little is known about the epidemiology and outcomes associated with bacteremia due to vr enterococcus faecalis. a retrospective study of isolates obtained from january 2008 to october 2010 was conducted at detroit medical center (dmc). unique patients with blood cultures positive for vre were reviewed. outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression. during the study period, 105 cases of bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis and 197 cases of bacteremia due to vr e. faecium were identified. the mean age in the study cohort was 61.5 +/- 15 years; 162 subjects (53.6%) were male. after controlling for a propensity  score, bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis was associated with >2-fold-lower in-hospital mortality than bacteremia due to vr e. faecium. interestingly, bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis was associated with longer hospital stay after vre isolation, although total length of stay was similar for groups with vr e. faecalis and vr e. faecium. bacteremia due to vr e. faecalis was associated with  a >2-fold-lower risk for mortality than bacteremia due to vr e. faecium, possibly due to the availability of beta-lactam therapeutics for treatment of vr e. faecalis.

TI  == surveillance of bacterial contamination in small animal veterinary hospitals with special focus on antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits of enterococci.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination on 4 surfaces of 4 types of standard equipment in small animal veterinary hospitals. design: surveillance study. sample: 10 small animal veterinary hospitals. procedures: each hospital was visited 3 times at 4-month intervals; at each visit, a cage door, stethoscope, rectal thermometer, and mouth gag were swabbed. swab samples were each plated onto media for culture of enterococci and organisms in the family enterobacteriaceae. enterococci were identified via a species-specific pcr assay and soda gene sequencing; species of enterobacteriaceae were identified with a biochemical test kit. antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed via the disk diffusion method. enterococci were screened for virulence traits and genotyped to assess clonality. results: among the 10 hospitals, enterococci were  isolated from cage doors in 7, from stethoscopes in 7, from thermometers in 6, and from mouth gags in 1; contamination with species of enterobacteriaceae was rare. enterococci were mainly represented by enterococcus faecium (35.4%), enterococcus faecalis (33.2%), and enterococcus hirae (28.3%). antimicrobial resistance was common in e. faecium, whereas virulence traits were present in 99% of e. faecalis isolates but not in e. faecium isolates. clonal multidrug-resistant e. faecium was isolated from several surfaces at 1 hospital over multiple visits, whereas sporadic nonclonal contamination was detected in other hospitals. conclusions and clinical relevance: contamination of surfaces in small animal veterinary hospitals with multidrug-resistant enterococci is a potential concern for pets and humans contacting these surfaces. implementing precautions to minimize enterococcal contamination on these surfaces is recommended.

TI  == [enterococcus: phenotype and genotype resistance and epidemiology in spain].
AB  == enterococci are major nosocomial pathogens due to their intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobials as well as to their ability to acquire new mechanisms of resistance. acquired resistance to beta-lactams is due to pbp5 overproduction or  alterations in this protein. beta-lactamase production is anecdotal. high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides is due to the production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that delete synergistic killing in association with cell wall-active agents. the most frequent enzyme is aac(6')- aph(2"), which inactivates all the aminoglycosides most frequently used in clinical practice. acquired resistance to glycopeptides is due to the acquisition of gene clusters called vana, vanb, vand, vane, vang, vanl, vanm and vann. linezolid resistance is due to ribosomal mutations or to the acquisition of the cfr gene. some isolates present diminished susceptibility to daptomycin. in spain, both enterococcal resistance to beta-lactams and hlr to aminoglycosides are high. e. faecalis is almost uniformly susceptible to ampicillin. enterococcal resistance to glycopeptides is low, with the exception of occasional outbreaks. the new antimicrobials (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) are almost uniformly active against these microorganisms. because of the wide dissemination of the high-risk  clonal complexes cc2 and cc9 (e. faecalis), and cc17 (e. faecium), surveillance studies are required to detect antimicrobial resistance genes as well as to identify high-risk clonal complexes in order to predict future trends in the acquisition of resistance genes.

TI  == impact of enterococcus on immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with perforation of the small or large bowel.
AB  == introduction and methods: the role of enterococcus in intraabdominal infection remains controversial. a retrospective study of 473 patients with bowel perforation was conducted to assess the impact of enterococci on outcome of patients with perforation of the small and large bowel. results: the overall mean age was 61.4 with a gender ratio of 60/40 (m/f). we detected enterococci in 54% of all patients. in the group of enterococci-positive patients, we found enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) in over 70% and enterococcus faecium (e. faecium) in over 50%. those in whom we detected enterococci (pos) had a higher 90-day mortality rate than patients who were enterococci negative (neg) (29.7%/19.4%, p 0.007). morbidity, length of stay in intensive care unit (icu-los) and length of stay in hospital (hospital-los) were significantly higher in the pos group. the subgroup of pos who received specific antimicrobial therapy against these species (pos-treated) had a higher 90-day mortality rate than the subgroup without specific therapy (pos-not treated) (35.5%/23.3%, p 0.04). the pos-not treated group had higher morbidity, icu-los and hospital-los than the neg group. the mortality rate, icu-los and hospital-los of immunosuppressed patients  (12%) were significantly higher compared with patients not on immunosuppression with similar morbidity. we found a higher rate of e. faecium than in other studies (55.1%). however, we observed no difference in mortality and morbidity between patients infected with e. faecalis and e. faecium. in multivariate analysis, detection of enterococci did not influence mortality. significant risk  factors were age, immunosuppression, specific antimicrobial therapy and anastomotic leakage. conclusion: enterococci seem to play a minor role in uncomplicated intraabdominal infections. our results suggest that enterococci play a role in the severity of postoperative complications. in particular, detection of enterococci in patients with anastomotic leakage are suggested to be an indicator of severe illness. we found significantly higher rates of e. faecium than described before, but no significant differences in clinical outcome between e. faecalis and e. faecium. when empirical therapy against enterococci is recommended, e. faecalis and e. faecium should both be covered.

AB  == enterococcus faecium is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for numerous outbreaks worldwide. the basis for the colonization capacities, host persistence  and environmental stress response of the hospital-adapted clones emerging from e. faecium are poorly understood. in this study, we propose the use of galleria mellonella as a simple nonmammalian model to assess e. faecium host persistence.  various strains (n = 10), including hospital-adapted, commensal or animal isolates and a soda-deficient strain were used to assess the relevance of this model. compared to enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium strains do not appear very lethal in a galleria killing assay. the ability of e. faecium strains to overcome host-immune responses and multiply within the host system was evaluated by monitoring bacterial loads following galleria infection. among the e. faecium strains, two hospital-adapted isolates displayed increased colonization ability.  in contrast, inactivation of soda, encoding a putative manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, significantly reduced survival of e. faecium to galleria defenses. galleria appears to be a suitable and convenient surrogate model to study e. faecium survival to host defenses and the role of suspected virulence factors in the colonization process.

TI  == is the production of the biogenic amines tyramine and putrescine a species-level  trait in enterococci?
AB  == biogenic amines (ba) are toxic nitrogenous compounds that can be accumulated in foods via the microbial decarboxylation of certain amino acids. lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains belonging to different species and genera have been described as ba producers and are mainly responsible for their synthesis in fermented foods. it is generally accepted that the capacity to produced bas is strain-dependent. however, the large number of enterococci identified as ba producers suggests that the aminogenic trait may be a species-level characteristic. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus durans strains of different origin were analysed to determine their capacity to produce tyramine and putrescine. the presence of the genes responsible for this and the identity of their flanking regions were checked by pcr. the results suggest that tyramine biosynthesis is a species-level characteristic in e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. durans. putrescine synthesis was found to be a species-level trait of e. faecalis, with production occurring via the agmatine deamination pathway. some e. faecium strains of human origin also produced putrescine; this trait was probably acquired via horizontal gene transfer.

AB  == this study characterized the fecal indicator bacteria (fib), including escherichia coli (e. coli) and enteroccocus (ent), disseminated over time in the  bay of vidy, which is the most contaminated area of lake geneva. sediments were collected from a site located at approximately 500 m from the present waste water treatment plant (wwtp) outlet pipe, in front of the former wwtp outlet pipe, which was located at only 300 m from the coastal recreational area (before 2001). e. coli and ent were enumerated in sediment suspension using the membrane filter  method. the fib characterization was performed for human enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and enterococcus faecium (e. faecium) and human specific bacteroides by pcr using specific primers and a matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). bacterial cultures revealed that maximum values of 35.2 x 10(8) and 6.6 x 10(6)cfu g(-1) dry sediment for e. coli and ent, respectively, were found in the sediments deposited following eutrophication of lake geneva in the 1970s, whereas the wwtp started operating in 1964. the same tendency was observed for the presence of human fecal pollution: the percentage of pcr amplification with primers esp-1/esp-2 for e. faecalis and e. faecium indicated that more than 90% of these bacteria were from  human origin. interestingly, the pcr assays for specific-human bacteroides hf183/hf134 were positive for dna extracted from all isolated strains of sediment surrounding wwpt outlet pipe discharge. the maldi-tof ms confirmed the presence of general e. coli and predominance e. faecium in isolated strains. our results demonstrated that human fecal bacteria highly increased in the sediments contaminated with wwtp effluent following the eutrophication of lake geneva. additionally, other fib cultivable strains from animals or adapted environmental  strains were detected in the sediment of the bay. the approaches used in this research are valuable to assess the temporal distribution and the source of the human fecal pollution in aquatic environments.

TI  == [high level of aminoglycoside resistance among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium strains].
AB  == enterococcus sp. strains are believed as important reason of serious nosocomial infections currently. these infections are cured by using combination of beta-lactams and aminoglycosides for their treatment. enterococcus sp. resistant  to high-level doses of aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and vancomycin are responsible for therapeutic failure. the aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of isolation and susceptibility to antibiotics of hlar enterococcus sp. strains isolated between 2007 and 2010 from the patients of university hospital no. 1 of dr a. jurasz collegium medicum of l. rydygier in bydgoszcz nicolaus copernicus university in torun. amongst 6137 enterococcus sp. strains 1124 (18,3%) presented hlar phenotype; 53,1% of them was identified as e. faecalis and 46,9% as e. faecium. the highest percentage of all examined strains was isolated  from the patients of different surgery clinics, intensive care units, and pediatrics, hematology and oncology clinic. hlar and hlsr phenotypes were noted in e. faecalis, for 45,7% and 27,5% strains, in e. faecium - 29,8% and 9,5%, respectively. hlgr phenotype was presented twice more often in e. faecium than e. faecalis. highest percentages of e. faecium resistant to glycopeptides and rifampicin were observed when compared with e. faecalis. the highest percentages  of strains intermediate, resistant to vancomycin and resistant to glycopeptides were noted for e. faecium strains with phenotypes hlar, hlgr and hlsr.

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from wild flowers.
AB  == wild flowers in the south of spain were screened for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. enterococci were frequently associated with prickypear and  fieldpoppy flowers. forty-six isolates, from 8 different flower species, were identified as e. faecalis (28 isolates) or e. faecium (18 isolates) and clustered in well-defined groups by eric-pcr fingerprinting. a high incidence of antibiotic resistance was detected among the e. faecalis isolates, especially to quinupristin/dalfopristin (75%), rifampicin (68%) and ciprofloxacin (57%), and to a lesser extent to levofloxacin (35.7%), erythromycin (28.5%), tetracycline (3.5%), chloramphenicol (3.5%) and streptomycin (3.5%). similar results were observed for e. faecium isolates, except for a higher incidence of resistance to  tetracycline (17%) and lower to erythromycin (11%) or quinupristin/dalfopristin (22%). vancomycin or teicoplanin resistances were not detected. most isolates (especially e. faecalis) were proteolytic and carried the gelatinase gene gele. genes encoding other potential virulence factors (ace, efaa (fs), ccf and cpd) were frequently detected. cytolysin genes were mainly detected in a few haemolytic e. faecium isolates, three of which also carried the collagen adhesin  acm gene. hyaluronidase gene (hyl ( efm )) was detected in two isolates. many isolates produced bacteriocins and carried genes for enterocins a, b, and l50 mainly. the similarities found between enterococci from wild flowers and those from animal and food sources raise new questions about the puzzling lifestyle of  these commensals and opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == optimizing future treatment of enterococcal infections: attacking the biofilm?
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are among the leading causative agents of nosocomial infections and are infamous for their resistance to many antibiotics. they cause difficult-to-treat infections, often originating from biofilm-mediated infections associated with implanted medical devices or endocarditis. biofilms protect bacteria against antibiotics and phagocytosis, and physical removal of devices or infected tissue is often needed but is frequently  not possible. currently there are no clinically available compounds that disassemble biofilms. in this review we discuss all known structural and regulatory genes involved in enterococcal biofilm formation, the compounds directed against biofilm formation that have been studied, and potentially useful targets for future drugs to treat enterococcal biofilm-associated infections.

AB  == the dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of s. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of e. faecium. grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing s. aureus (the ratio of s. epidermidis and  s. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). the isolation rate of e. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of e. faecalis and e. faecium in 2009 was  4.3. the microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to e. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. in the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of mrsa or vre is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).

TI  == characterization of an anti-listerial enterocin from wheat silage based enterococcus faecium.
AB  == two enterococcus faecium and one e. faecalis strains isolated and identified from wheat silage were characterized based on plasmid content, hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance patterns, bacteriocin production potential, and presence of enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entp, entl50b). among the isolates, only  the e. faecium u7 strain exhibited bacteriocin activity against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. (vre). a combination of three structural genes (enta, entb, and entp) was detected in e. faecium u7. a relationship between the presence of enterocin structural genes, and bacteriocin activity was detected in e. faecium u7; therefore partially purified enterocin (ppe) was further investigated from the isolate. several bands of different molecular weights were expressed from ppe extracts following tricine sds-page analysis. however, the only band showing bacteriocin activity was in an  approximate 4-kda region. ppe treatment with proteinase k, lysozyme, and alpha -amylase caused complete loss of bacteriocin activity. ppe heat treatment at various temperatures resulted in a notable reduction in bacteriocin expression. enterocin u7 was relatively heat stable, and presumably exhibits a glucoprotein nature with distinct inhibitory properties. specific bacterial inhibitory activity of enterocin u7, and the producer strain absence of beta -hemolysis and  vancomycin susceptibility features deserves further investigation to evaluate its potential application in silage inoculation and food preservation.

TI  == [frequency of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from blood cultures from  2008 to 2010].
AB  == introduction: enterococci are important hospital-acquired pathogens. the most commonly isolated species of the genus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are the third to fourth-most prevalent nosocomial pathogens worldwide. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of resistance to vancomycin  and other antimicrobial agents of enterococcus spp strains isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients. material and methods: during the three-year period, from 2008 to 2010, 132 strains of enterococcus spp isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients were tested for their susceptibility to ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamycin (high-level resistance), erythromycin, chloramphenicol, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin by disc diffusion method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. susceptibility of vancomycin resistant e. faecium to the same antibiotics and to linezolid, quinopristin/dalfopristin and tigecyclin was determined using vitek system. results and discussion: resistance to vancomycin was detected in 21 (15.9%) enterococcus spp strains. the percentage of resistance to other antimicrobial agents varied from 23. l% for chloramphenicol to 81.3% for ciproflxacin. all vancomycin resistant enterococci were identified as e. faecium and belonged to phenotype vana. the resistance to other antibiotics was very high, except for linezolid and quinopristin/dalfopristin (4.7%). the high-level aminoglycoside resistance was 87.6% for gentamycin and 95.2% for streptomycin. all isolates were resistant to ampicillin, teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: the detected  high frequency of multidrug-resistant isolates among vancomycin resistant enterococci is of great importance and suggests the need for further monitoring of susceptibility in order to take adequate measures to prevent and control spreading of resistant strains.

TI  == mechanistic analysis of muraymycin analogues: a guide to the design of mray inhibitors.
AB  == the systematic structure-activity relationship (sar) of the muraymycins (mrys) using an ugi four-component reaction (u4cr) was investigated. the impact of the lipophilic substituent on antibacterial activity was significant, and the analogues 8 and 9 having a lipophilic side chain exhibited good activity against  a range of gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including mrsa and vre. further investigation of compounds 8 and 9 revealed these analogues to be selective inhibitors of the mray transferase and nontoxic to hepg2 cells. the sar of the accessory urea-peptide moiety indicated that it could be simplified. our sar study of the mrys suggests a probable mechanism for inhibition of the mray, where the inner moiety of the urea-dipeptide motif interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain in the cytoplasmic loop 5. the predicted binding model would provide further direction toward the design of potent mray inhibitors. this study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on mrys.

TI  == diurnal variation in enterococcus species composition in polluted ocean water and a potential role for the enterococcal carotenoid in protection against photoinactivation.
AB  == enterococcus species composition was determined each hour for 72 h at a polluted  marine beach in avalon, santa catalina island, ca. species composition during the day was significantly different from that at night, based on an analysis of similarity. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were more prevalent at night than during the day, while e. hirae and other enterococcus species were more prevalent during the day than the night. enterococcus spp. containing a yellow pigment were more common during the day than the night, suggesting that the pigmented phenotype may offer a competitive advantage under sunlit conditions. a  laboratory microcosm experiment established that the pigmented e. casseliflavus isolate and a pigmented e. faecalis isolate recovered from the field site decay slower than a nonpigmented e. faecalis isolate in a solar simulator in simulated, clear seawater. this further supports the idea that the yellow carotenoid pigment in enterococcus provides protection under sunlit conditions. the findings are in  accordance with previous work with other carotenoid-containing nonphotosynthetic  and photosynthetic bacteria that suggests that the carotenoid is able to quench reactive oxygen species capable of causing photoinactivation and photostress. the results suggest that using enterococcal species composition as a microbial source tracking tool may be hindered by the differential environmental persistence of pigmented and nonpigmented enterococci.

TI  == bacteriophage lysis of enterococcus host strains: a tool for microbial source tracking?
AB  == this paper describes the isolation of enterococcus host strains, for potential use as simple bacteriophage (phage)-based microbial source tracking (mst) tools.  presumptive enterococcus host strains were isolated from cattle feces, raw municipal wastewater, agricultural runoff, and waters impacted by farms or wastewater treatment works (wwtw) in southern england, united kingdom (uk). all enterococcal host strains (n = 390) were first screened for their ability to detect phage in samples of raw municipal wastewater and fecal material from cattle, pigs, and sheep. host strains that detected phage (n = 147) were ranked according to both their specificity to a particular fecal source and also the number of phages (expressed as plaque-forming units, pfu) that they detected per  milliliter of sample. host strains that demonstrated host specificity and which detected phages at levels greater than 100 pfu/ml (n = 29) were further tested using additional fecal samples of human and nonhuman origin. the specificity and  sensitivity of the enterococcal host strains were found to vary, ranging from 44  to 100% and from 17 to 83%, respectively. most notably, seven strains exhibited 100% specificity to either cattle, human, or pig samples. isolates exhibiting specificity to cattle were identified as belonging to the species enterococcus casseliflavus , enterococcus mundtii , or enterococcus gallinarum , while human and pig isolates were members of either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis . the high specificity of phages infecting enterococcus hosts and the simplicity and relatively low cost of the approach collectively indicate a strong potential for using this method as a tool in mst.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to control the post-outbreak prevalence of  vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the affected kyoto region. the study period was from 2005 to 2010. faecal samples were subjected to vre screening, and vancomycin resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the genotype was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of genomic dna digested with smai and by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a vre control programme was established in 2006, consisting of a laboratory-based faecal vre screening system, annual surveillance of hospital inpatients and the promotion of adequate infection control measures. vana-enterococcus faecium, vanb-e. faecium and vanb-e. faecalis were detected at 35, 12 and 5 hospitals, respectively. genotype analysis revealed that all of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolates obtained since 2005 belonged to st78, and that clonally related vanb-e.  faecalis of st64 had spread to three hospitals. the rate of faecal vre carriage among the patients enrolled in the annual surveillance increased until 2007, when it reached 24 (1.2%) of the 2,035 enrolled patients. the rate began to decrease in 2008 and, by 2010, reached a low of 4 (0.17%) of the 2,408 enrolled patients.  while vre did spread within the kyoto region, the vre control programme succeeded in controlling the overall vre spread.

TI  == enterococci as probiotics and their implications in food safety.
AB  == enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and they are of importance in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as  their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. however, they are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and  other infections. some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. the role of enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or as probiotics. studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it  is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. specific genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as e. faecium clonal complex (cc) 17 and e. faecalis cc2, cc9, cc28 and cc40, which are high risk enterococcal clonal complexes. these are characterised by the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on pathogenicity islands or plasmids. mobile genetic elements thus are considered to play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. although enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. some e. faecium and e. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers,  generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. such probiotics are administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. in animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea, for immune stimulation or to improve growth. from a food microbiological point of view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on  the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. the advantage of use of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view, lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. the use of enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit analysis.

TI  == comparison of genotypic and phenotypic cluster analyses of virulence determinants and possible role of crispr elements towards their incidence in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are human commensals frequently found in fermented foods or used as probiotics, but also recognized as opportunistic pathogens. we investigated 62 enterococcus strains isolated from clinical, food and environmental origins towards a rationale for safety evaluation of strains in food or probiotic applications. all isolates were characterised with respect to the presence of the virulence determinants fsrb, spre, gele, ace, efaafs/fm, as, esp, cob and the cytolysin operon. in addition rapd-pcr was used to obtain genomic fingerprints that were clustered and compared to phenotypic profiles generated by maldi-tof-ms. the gelatinase phenotype (gele) and the haemolytic activity (beta-haemolysis) were analysed. e. faecium strains contained esp and efaafm only, and none of them contained any crispr elements. the amenability of e. faecalis strains to acquisition of virulence factors was investigated along the occurrence of crispr associated (cas) genes. while distribution of most virulence factors, and rapd versus maldi-tof-ms typing patterns were unrelated, 2 out of 5 rapd clusters almost exclusively contained clinical e. faecalis isolates, and an occurrence of crispr elements versus reduced number of virulence factors was observed. the presence of the cytolysin operon, cob and as encoding pheromone and aggregation substance, respectively, significantly corresponded to absence of cas. as their production promote genetic exchange, their absence limits further gene acquisition and distribution. thus, absence of the cytolysin operon, cob and as in a cas positive environment suggests itself as promising candidate for e. faecalis evaluation towards their occurrence in food fermentation or use as probiotics.

TI  == resistance patterns and occurrence of virulence determinants among gre strains in southwestern poland.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance and  the occurrence of virulence determinants among glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) isolated in 2007-2009 from patients hospitalized in southwestern poland. material and methods: the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antibiotics were determined by agar dilution method or by e-test(r). the presence of vana - vang resistance and virulence genes (agg, esp, gele and cyla, cylb, cylm) was investigated using pcr. the ability to form biofilm and the activity of gelatinase, hemolysins, lipase and dnase were tested. results: all the gre strains were susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline and resistant  to norfloxacin. in the enterococcus faecium group, 17 strains carried the vana gene and 20 the vanb gene. in the enterococcu faecalis group, 4 strains carried the vana gene and 1 the vanb gene. there were differences in tetracycline susceptibility between the vana (70%) and the vanb (55%) phenotypes. only linezolid had high activity against both the vana and the vanb phenotypes. the esp gene was present in most of the gre strains, but only 3 e. faecalis strains produced biofilm. lipase was produced by 10/42 examined strains, gelatinase by 4/42 and hemolysin by 3/42 isolates. conclusions: linezolid seems to be the optimal option in empirical therapy of infections caused by gre strains because of the relationship between its activity (mic value) and susceptibility breakpoint. there was no correlation between the prevalence of different virulence genes and resistance to the antibiotics tested.

TI  == [investigation of the efficacy of some disinfectants against nosocomial staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates].
AB  == nosocomial infections which exhibit an increasing trend worldwide, are important  contributors to morbidity and mortality. most bacteria that cause nosocomial infections can retain their viability even after exposure to disinfectants in routine practice. this study was conducted to determine the susceptibilities of nosocomial staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates to various disinfectants. a total of 30 s.aureus [16 were methicillin-resistant (mrsa), 14 were methicillin-susceptible (mssa)] and 21 enterococcus spp. (13 e.faecalis, 7 e.faecium, 1 non-typable enterococcus spp.) strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients as nosocomial infection agents in the central microbiology laboratory of ibn-i sina hospital, ankara university, faculty of medicine, were included in the study. glutaraldehyde (2% wt/vol), chlorhexidine gluconate (4% wt/vol), 2-propanol (70% vol/vol), povidone iodine (7.5% wt/vol), povidone iodine (10% wt/vol) and hydrogen peroxide (3% wt/vol) susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated by quantitative suspension test at contact times of 3, 5, and 10 minutes. all of the isolates were found susceptible to glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) at all tested contact times. however,  12 s.aureus (5 mssa, 7 mrsa) and 3 enterococci (2 e.faecium, 1 e.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 3 minutes contact time; 11 s.aureus (4 mssa, 7 mrsa) and 7 e.faecalis isolates were found susceptible at 5 minutes contact time, and 6 s.aureus (4 mssa, 2 mrsa) and 3 enterococci (1 e.faecium, 2 e.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible at 10 minutes contact time. one mssa and 8 enterococci (4 e.faecium, 3 e.faecalis, 1 enterococcus spp.) isolates were found resistant to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 10  minutes contact time. in conclusion, glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) can be safely used against s.aureus and enterococcus spp. owing to their high effectiveness, however, hydrogen peroxide (3%) should not be preferred against those strains due to the presence of resistant isolates, in ankara university ibn-i sina hospital.

TI  == [the relationship between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary  enterococcus isolates].
AB  == increasing multidrug resistance in nosocomial enterococcus strains from all over  the world recently enhances the need for further investigation of enterococci, especially their virulence factors. there are still many lacking parts about virulence factors of clinical enterococcus isolates. in this study, it was aimed  to investigate the antibiotic resistance and the presence of potential virulence  factors of 91 enterococcus strains (59 e.faecalis, 31 e.faecium and 1 e.gallinarum) isolated from urine cultures of inpatients between january 2008-june 2010 in our hospital and also to evaluate whether a correlation existed between antibiotic resistance and potential virulence factors. the genes which encoded virulence factors of enterococci; aggregation substance (as), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and hyaluronidase (hyl) (asa1, esp, hyl respectively) were studied by molecular methods and haemolysin production and gelatinase activity were studied by phenotypic methods. vancomycin resistant strains were checked for the presence of vana and vanb genes. eight (25.8%) e.faecium isolates were found glycopeptide resistant. in seven of these isolates  resistance type was vana and in one it was neither vana nor vanb. high-level gentamicin and high-level streptomycin resistance rates were 74.2% and 61.3% in e.faecium strains and were 22% ve 27.1% in e.faecalis strains, respectively. beta-lactamase production and linezolid resistance were not detected in any of the strains. e.faecium isolates were more resistant (p< 0.001-0.013) than e.faecalis isolates to all tested antibiotics except tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline and streptogramin (p< 0.001). hyl gene positivity (p< 0.001) was found higher in e.faecium isolates whereas esp (p= 0.003) and asa1 (p< 0.001) gene positivity, haemolysin production (p=0.014) and gelatinase activity (p= 0.029) were higher in e.faecalis isolates. as and esp were the most frequent virulence factors, with the rates of 26.7% and 25.6%, respectively. there were 32 (35.6%) strains without any of the investigated virulence factors. we have also detected that asa1 gene positive e.faecalis isolates were more resistant to ciprofloxacin (p= 0.001), norfloxacin (p= 0.006) and levofloxacin (p= 0.001) than asa1 gene negative isolates; esp gene positive e.faecalis isolates were more resistant to doxycycline (p= 0.043) than esp gene negative isolates and hyl gene  positive e.faecium isolates were more resistant to nitrofurantoine (p= 0.011) than hyl gene negative isolates. this was the first clinical sample originated study, investigating the corelation between antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in urinary enterococcus isolates in turkey.

TI  == snp diversity of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a south east queensland waterway, australia, and associated antibiotic resistance gene profiles.
AB  == background: enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are associated with faecal pollution of water, linked to swimmer-associated gastroenteritis and demonstrate a wide range of antibiotic resistance. the coomera river is a main water source for the pimpama-coomera watershed and is located in south east queensland, australia, which is used intensively for agriculture and recreational purposes. this study investigated the diversity of e. faecalis and e. faecium using single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and associated antibiotic resistance profiles. results: total enterococcal counts (cfu/ml) for three/six sampling sites were above the united states environmental protection agency (usepa) recommended level during rainfall periods and fall into categories b and c of the australian national health and medical research council (nhmrc) guidelines (with  a 1-10% gastrointestinal illness risk). e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were  grouped into 29 and 23 snp profiles (validated by mlst analysis) respectively. this study showed the high diversity of e. faecalis and e. faecium over a period  of two years and both human-related and human-specific snp profiles were identified. 81.8% of e. faecalis and 70.21% of e. faecium snp profiles were associated with genotypic and phenotypic antibiotic resistance. gentamicin resistance was higher in e. faecalis (47% resistant) and harboured the aac(6')-aph(2') gene. ciprofloxacin resistance was more common in e. faecium (12.7% resistant) and gyra gene mutations were detected in these isolates. tetracycline resistance was less common in both species while tet(l) and tet(m) genes were more prevalent. ampicillin resistance was only found in e. faecium isolates with mutations in the pbp5 gene. vancomycin resistance was not detected  in any of the isolates. we found that antibiotic resistance profiles further sub-divided the snp profiles of both e. faecalis and e. faecium. conclusions: the distribution of e. faecalis and e. faecium genotypes is highly diverse in the coomera river. the snp genotyping method is rapid and robust and can be applied to study the diversity of e. faecalis and e. faecium in waterways. it can also be used to test for human-related and human-specific enterococci in water. the resolving power can be increased by including antibiotic-resistant profiles which can be used as a possible source tracking tool. this warrants further investigation.

TI  == serotypes and antibiotic resistance in group b streptococcus isolated from patients at the maternity hospital, kuwait.
AB  == a total of 143 group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates collected from mothers at the maternity hospital in kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by pcr for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetm, tetl, teto), erythromycin (erma, ermb, ermc, ermtr, ermm, mefa, mefe, msra) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). all isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. most of the isolates belonged to serotypes v (38.5 %), iii (20.9 %), ia (7.7 %) and ii (11.2 %). sixteen isolates  (11.2 %) were nontypable. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (mics 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin  (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). the tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetm (94.5 %), teto (3.9 %), tetl (1.6  %) and tetk (0.8 %). the erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermb (61.1 %), ermtr (38.9 %), erma (5.5 %), mefa (5.5 %) and mefe (11 %). all high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. one of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. partial dna sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the gbs isolates could have acquired aph3 from other gram-positive cocci. the high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.

TI  == influence of synthetic peptide inducers on antibacterial activity of enterococci.
AB  == antibacterial activity of probiotic enterococci is often related to the production of bacteriocins. there is a variety of enterococcus faecium strains which synthesise one or several enterocins including a, b, p, 96, l50ab and others. in this work we have analysed the probiotic strain e. faecium l3 whose genome contained the genes encoding enterocins capital a, cyrillic, capital ve, cyrillic and a three-component regulatory system. all these genes were found to be expressed in enterococcal strain l3. antimicrobial activity of the strain tested on the strains of listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus agalactiae was  pheromone dependent. chemically synthesised cyclic peptides (analogues and shorter derivates of entf) with different molecular structures were able to increase the antagonistic activity of the strain e. faecium l3 in contrast to the strain e. faecium sf68, which does nsmall o, cyrillict have genes encoding enterocins capital a, cyrillic and capital ve, cyrillic.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal microbiota of greek healthy infants.
AB  == increasing use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and also for non-therapeutic reasons (agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture) has led to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness  of antimicrobial treatment. commensal intestinal bacteria are very often exposed  to the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents and may constitute a reservoir  of antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogens. the present study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the  presence of selected resistance genes in cocci isolated from the faecal microbiota of 35 healthy, full-term infants at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery.  a total of 148 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were isolated and tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics by disk-diffusion technique. multiplex pcr analysis was performed for the identification of enterococcus spp.  isolates and the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistance genes. pcr-based methodology was used also for identification of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants. identification results indicated e. faecalis as the predominant species (81 strains), followed by e. faecium, e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (39.9%), erythromycin (35.1%), vancomycin (19.6%) and to nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors was detected. pcr data revealed 24 out of 52 erythromycin-resistant isolates carrying the ermb gene and 32 out of 59 tetracycline-resistant strains carrying tet genes, with tet(l) determinant being the most frequently detected. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was reported among tested isolates. in conclusion, erythromycin and tetracycline acquired resistant  traits are widespread among faecal cocci isolates from greek, healthy infants under no apparent antimicrobial selective pressure.

TI  == lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci on u.s. conventional poultry farms that transitioned to organic practices.
AB  == background: in u.s. conventional poultry production, antimicrobials are used for  therapeutic, prophylactic, and nontherapeutic purposes. researchers have shown that this can select for antibiotic-resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria on poultry farms and in poultry-derived products. however, no u.s. studies have investigated on-farm changes in resistance as conventional poultry farms transition to organic practices and cease using antibiotics. objective: we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococcus on u.s. conventional poultry farms that transitioned to organic practices. methods: poultry litter, feed, and water samples were collected from 10 conventional and 10 newly organic poultry houses in 2008 and tested for enterococcus. enterococcus (n = 259) was identified using the vitek(r) 2 compact system and tested for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobials using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. data were analyzed using sas software (version 9.2), and statistical associations were derived based on generalized linear mixed models. results: litter, feed, and water samples were enterococcus positive. the percentages of resistant enterococcus faecalis and resistant enterococcus faecium were significantly lower (p < 0.05) among isolates from newly organic versus conventional poultry houses for two (erythromycin and tylosin) and five (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, and tetracycline) antimicrobials, respectively. forty-two percent of e. faecalis isolates from conventional poultry houses were multidrug resistant (mdr; resistant to three or  more antimicrobial classes), compared with 10% of isolates from newly organic poultry houses (p = 0.02); 84% of e. faecium isolates from conventional poultry houses were mdr, compared with 17% of isolates from newly organic poultry houses  (p < 0.001). conclusions: our findings suggest that the voluntary removal of antibiotics from large-scale u.s. poultry farms that transition to organic practices is associated with a lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant and mdr enterococcus.

TI  == dogs leaving the icu carry a very large multi-drug resistant enterococcal population with capacity for biofilm formation and horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == the enterococcal community from feces of seven dogs treated with antibiotics for  2-9 days in the veterinary intensive care unit (icu) was characterized. both, culture-based approach and culture-independent 16s rdna amplicon 454 pyrosequencing, revealed an abnormally large enterococcal community: 1.4+/-0.8x10(8) cfu gram(-1) of feces and 48.9+/-11.5% of the total 16,228 sequences, respectively. the diversity of the overall microbial community was very low which likely reflects a high selective antibiotic pressure. the enterococcal diversity based on 210 isolates was also low as represented by enterococcus faecium (54.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (45.4%). e. faecium was frequently resistant to enrofloxacin (97.3%), ampicillin (96.5%), tetracycline (84.1%), doxycycline (60.2%), erythromycin (53.1%), gentamicin (48.7%), streptomycin (42.5%), and nitrofurantoin (26.5%). in e. faecalis, resistance was  common to tetracycline (59.6%), erythromycin (56.4%), doxycycline (53.2%), and enrofloxacin (31.9%). no resistance was detected to vancomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfopristin in either species. many isolates carried virulence traits including gelatinase, aggregation substance, cytolysin, and enterococcal surface protein. all e. faecalis strains were biofilm formers in vitro and this phenotype correlated with the presence of gele and/or esp. in vitro intra-species conjugation assays demonstrated that e. faecium were capable  of transferring tetracycline, doxycycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin resistance traits to human clinical strains. multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (mlva) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge)  of e. faecium strains showed very low genotypic diversity. interestingly, three e. faecium clones were shared among four dogs suggesting their nosocomial origin. furthermore, multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) of nine representative mlva types revealed that six sequence types (sts) originating from five dogs were identical  or closely related to sts of human clinical isolates and isolates from hospital outbreaks. it is recommended to restrict close physical contact between pets released from the icu and their owners to avoid potential health risks.

AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == presence of glycopeptide-encoding plasmids in enterococcal isolates from food and humans in denmark.
AB  == enterococci and especially glycopeptides-resistant enterococci (gre) are a growing concern due to their ability to cause infections in hospitals. transmission of antimicrobial resistance between reservoirs such as animals, meat, and humans are in most cases linked to transmission of mobile genetic elements (mge) such as plasmids and transposons. presence of mge was tested in all gre isolated from food in denmark in 2005-2007 including the first vana mediated enterococcus faecalis isolated from food. the ability of these plasmids  to transfer and persist among enterococci was investigated using newly developed  techniques for classification of plasmids. replicons associated with sex pheromone-inducible plasmids were detected in all gr e. faecalis, whereas gr enterococcus faecium contained plasmids known to be widely distributed among enterococci. vana resistance is common in e. faecium isolates from meat and animals in europe and is rarely found in e. faecalis. this article describes the  first characterization of mge from vana mediated e. faecalis, thus linking this resistance genotype to pheromone responding plasmids.

TI  == high-density fecal enterococcus faecium colonization in hospitalized patients is  associated with the presence of the polyclonal subcluster cc17.
AB  == enterococcus faecium belonging to the polyclonal subcluster cc17, with a typical  ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (arefm) phenotype, have become prevalent among nosocomial infections around the world. high-density intestinal arefm colonization could be one of the factors contributing to the successful spread of these pathogens. we aimed to quantify the enterococcal intestinal colonization densities in stool samples from arefm-colonized and non-colonized patients using  fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). stool samples were collected from arefm-colonized (n = 8) and non-colonized (n = 8) patients. the relative number of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium was determined by fish using specific 16s rrna probes, while the total amount of bacterial cells was counted by staining the sample with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi). the median bacterial cell numbers in fecal samples, counted by dapi staining, were 7.7 x 10(9) and 4.8 x 10(9) cells/g for arefm-colonized and non-colonized patients, respectively (p = 0.34). the e. faecium densities in arefm-colonized patients, accounting for 0.5-7% of all fecal bacterial cells, exceeded e. faecalis levels by over ten-fold. e. faecium was not detected in non-colonized patients. this study demonstrated high e. faecium cell densities in stool samples from patients colonized with arefm. increased cell densities may contribute to host-to-host transmission and environmental contamination, facilitating the spread of arefm in the hospital setting.

TI  == persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant (tet(r)) dairy enterococcus faecium isolate designated m7m2 was found to carry both tet(m) and tet(l) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. after  consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. dna sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (orfs), including a tet(m)-tet(l)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pre25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin  (ta) plasmid stabilization system. the derived backbone plasmid without the tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a ta-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. the tet(m)-tet(l) gene cluster from m7m2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in enterococcus faecalis og1rf by electroporation and in streptococcus mutans ua159  by natural transformation. southern hybridization showed that both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were integrated into the chromosome of s. mutans ua159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in e. faecalis og1rf. quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes of pm7m2. the results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic  resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pm7m2, pip816, and pre25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.

TI  == mechanism of copper surface toxicity in vancomycin-resistant enterococci following wet or dry surface contact.
AB  == contaminated touch surfaces have been implicated in the spread of hospital-acquired infections, and the use of biocidal surfaces could help to reduce this cross-contamination. in a previous study we reported the death of aqueous inocula of pathogenic enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium isolates, simulating fomite surface contamination, in 1 h on copper alloys, compared to survival for months on stainless steel. in our current study we observed an even faster kill of over a 6-log reduction of viable enterococci in less than 10 min on copper alloys with a "dry" inoculum equivalent to touch contamination. we investigated the effect of copper(i) and copper(ii) chelation and the quenching of reactive oxygen species on cell viability assessed by culture and their effects on genomic dna, membrane potential, and respiration in  situ on metal surfaces. we propose that copper surface toxicity for enterococci involves the direct or indirect action of released copper ionic species and the generation of superoxide, resulting in arrested respiration and dna breakdown as  the first stages of cell death. the generation of hydroxyl radicals by the fenton reaction does not appear to be the dominant instrument of dna damage. the bacterial membrane potential is unaffected in the early stages of wet and dry surface contact, suggesting that the membrane is not compromised until after cell death. these results also highlight the importance of correct surface cleaning protocols to perpetuate copper ion release and prevent the chelation of ions by contaminants, which could reduce the efficacy of the surface.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and adhesion properties of oral enterococci associated to dental caries.
AB  == background: enterococci are increasingly associated with opportunistic infections in humans but the role of the oral cavity as a reservoir for this species is unclear. this study aimed to explore the carriage rate of enterococci in the oral cavity of tunisian children and their antimicrobial susceptibility to a broad range of antibiotics together with their adherence ability to abiotic and biotic  surfaces. results: in this study, 17 e. faecalis (27.5%) and 4 e. faecium (6.5%)  were detected. the identified strains showed resistance to commonly used antibiotics. among the 17 isolated e. faecalis, 12 strains (71%) were slime producers and 5 strains were non-producers. among the 4 e. faecium, 2 strains were slime producers. all the tested strains were able to adhere to at least one  of the two tested cell lines. our result showed that 11 e. faecalis and 2 e. faecium strains adhered strongly to hep-2 as well as to a549 cells. conclusions:  drugs resistance and strong biofilm production abilities together with a high phenotypic adhesion to host cells are important equipment in e. faecalis and e. faecium which lead to their oral cavity colonization and focal infections.

TI  == genetic organization and mode of action of a novel bacteriocin, bacteriocin 51: determinant of vana-type vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == bacteriocin 51 (bac 51) is encoded on the mobile plasmid phy (6,037 bp), which was isolated from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium vre38. bacteriocin 51 is active against e. faecium, e. hirae, and e. durans. sequence analysis of phy showed that it encodes nine open reading frames (orfs) from orf1 to orf9 (in that order). genetic analysis suggested that orf1 and orf2, which were designated baca and bacb, respectively, are the bacteriocin and immunity genes. baca encodes a 144-amino-acid protein. the deduced baca protein has a typical signal sequence at its amino terminus, and a potential signal peptidase-processing site corresponding to the v-e-a sequence is located between the 37th and 39th amino acids. the predicted mature baca protein consists of 105 amino acids. a potential promoter sequence was identified upstream of the start codon. bacb encodes a 55-amino-acid protein. no obvious promoter or terminator sequence was identified  between baca and bacb. northern blot analysis of baca and bacb with a baca rna probe produced a transcript of approximately 700 nucleotides, which corresponded  to the combined nucleotide sizes of baca and bacb, indicating that transcription  was initiated from the promoter upstream of baca, continued through bacb, and was terminated at the terminator downstream of bacb. the transcription start site was determined to be the t nucleotide located 6 nucleotides downstream from the -10 promoter sequence. these results indicate that baca and bacb constitute an operon and that baca is the bacteriocin structural gene while bacb is the immunity gene. the purified c-terminally his tagged baca protein of bac 51 showed bacteriostatic activity against the indicator strain. the purified c-terminally his tagged baca  protein of bac 32 (whose mature baca protein has 54 amino acids) and the culture  filtrates of the bac 31- and bac 43-producing e. faecalis strain fa2-2 showed bactericidal activity. bac 31 and bac 43 are pore-forming bacteriocins, unlike the newly characterized bacteriocin bac 51.

TI  == selection of fecal enterococci exhibiting tcrb-mediated copper resistance in pigs fed diets supplemented with copper.
AB  == copper, as copper sulfate, is increasingly used as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics for growth promotion in weaned piglets. acquired copper resistance, conferred by a plasmid-borne, transferable copper resistance (tcrb) gene, has been reported in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. a longitudinal field study was undertaken to determine the relationship between copper supplementation and the prevalence of tcrb-positive enterococci in piglets. the study was done with weaned piglets, housed in 10 pens with 6 piglets per pen, fed diets supplemented  with a normal (16.5 ppm; control) or an elevated (125 ppm) level of copper. fecal samples were randomly collected from three piglets per pen on days 0, 14, 28, and 42 and plated on m-enterococcus agar, and three enterococcal isolates were obtained from each sample. the overall prevalence of tcrb-positive enterococci was 21.1% (38/180) in piglets fed elevated copper and 2.8% (5/180) in the control. among the 43 tcrb-positive isolates, 35 were e. faecium and 8 were e. faecalis. the mean mics of copper for tcrb-negative and tcrb-positive enterococci were 6.2 and 22.2 mm, respectively. the restriction digestion of the genomic dna  of e. faecium or e. faecalis with s1 nuclease yielded a band of approximately 194-kbp size to which both tcrb and the erm(b) gene probes hybridized. a conjugation assay demonstrated cotransfer of tcrb and erm(b) genes between e. faecium and e. faecalis strains. the higher prevalence of tcrb-positive enterococci in piglets fed elevated copper compared to that in piglets fed normal copper suggests that supplementation of copper in swine diets selected for resistance.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria isolated from horses receiving virginiamycin for the prevention of pasture-associated laminitis.
AB  == enterococcus faecium, a major cause of potentially life-threatening hospital-acquired human infections, can be resistant to several antimicrobials, such that streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin (q/d) is one of the few antibiotics still effective. consequently use of the streptogramin virginiamycin  as an animal growth promoter was banned in the eu in 1999 as some believed this contributed to the emergence of q/d resistant e. faecium. virginiamycin is advocated for preventing equine pasture-associated laminitis, but its effect on equine faecal bacterial q/d resistance has not been determined. faecal samples were obtained from horses receiving virginiamycin, horses co-grazing and horses not exposed to virginiamycin. streptogramin resistant e. faecium were cultured from 70% (21/30) of animals treated with virginiamycin, 75% (18/24) of co-grazing animals and 69% (11/16) of animals not exposed. ermb and vatd genes were detected using real time pcr in 63% and 66% of animals treated with virginiamycin, 75% and 71% of co-grazing animals and 63% and 69% of animals not exposed. antimicrobial resistance genes were present only in samples which had cultured q/d resistant e. faecium. there was no significant difference between groups with respect to antimicrobial resistance. the gene load of vatd was significantly (p=0.04) greater in unexposed animals compared to those treated with virginiamycin. the use of virginiamycin to prevent pasture-associated laminitis does not appear to be related to an increased q/d resistance frequency. however, in view of the high frequency of resistance within all groups, the horse is a reservoir of q/d resistant genes and clones that potentially could be transferred transiently to humans.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == impact of medicated feed on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria at integrated pig-fish farms in vietnam.
AB  == integrated livestock-fish aquaculture utilizes animal excreta, urine, and feed leftovers as pond fertilizers to enhance the growth of plankton and other microorganisms eaten by the fish. however, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transferred and develop in the pond due to selective pressure from antimicrobials present in animal feed, urine, and feces. in an experimental pig-fish farm located in periurban hanoi, vietnam, nine piglets were provided feed containing 5 mug of tetracycline (tet)/kg pig weight/day and 0.45 mug of enrofloxacin (enr)/kg pig weight/day during the second and fourth (last) months of the experiment. the aim of this study was to determine the association between the provision of pig feed with antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance, as measured in a total of 520 escherichia coli and 634  enterococcus strains isolated from pig manure and water-sediment pond samples. mic values for nalidixic acid (nal) and enr showed that e. coli and enterococcus  spp. overall exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance toward nal and enr during the 2 months when pigs were administered feed with antimicrobials, with frequencies reaching 60 to 80% in both water-sediment and manure samples. tet resistance for both indicators was high (>80%) throughout the study period, which indicates that tet-resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. were present in  the piglets before the initiation of the experiment. pcr-based identification showed similar relative occurrences of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and other enterococcus spp. in the water-sediment and manure samples, suggesting that enterococcus spp. isolated in the ponds originated mainly from the pig manure. the development of antimicrobial resistance in integrated animal  husbandry-fish farms and possible transfers and the impact of such resistance on  food safety and human health should be further assessed.

TI  == eight-year (2002-2009) summary of the linezolid (zyvox(r) annual appraisal of potency and spectrum; zaaps) program in european countries.
AB  == the linezolid surveillance network (zaaps program) has been monitoring linezolid  activity and susceptibility rates for eight years (2002-2009) in european medical centers. samples from 12-24 sites annually in 11 countries were monitored by a central laboratory design using reference mic methods with international and regional interpretations (eucast). a total of 13,404 gram-positive pathogens were tested from 6 pathogen groups. linezolid remained without documented resistance from 2002 through 2005, but beginning in 2006 resistant strains emerged at very low rates among staphylococcus aureus (g2576t mutant in ireland, 2007), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; usually staphylococcus epidermidis, france and italy in 2006-2009) and enterococci (enterococcus faecium in germany [2006, 2008, 2009] and e. faecalis in sweden [2008], united kingdom [2008] and germany [2009]); all but one strain having a target mutation. a mobile cfr was detected in an italian cons strain (2008 and 2009), and clonal spread was noted for linezolid-resistant strains (pfge results). overall the linezolid susceptibility rates were >99.9, 99.7 and 99.6% for s. aureus, cons and enterococci, respectively; and all streptococcal strains were susceptible (mic(90), 1 mg/l). in conclusion, the zaaps program surveillance confirmed high,  sustained levels of linezolid activity from 2002-2009 and without evidence of mic creep or escalating resistance in gram-positive pathogens across monitored european nations.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of kumis, a traditional fermented colombian milk, with particular emphasis on enterococci population.
AB  == kumis is a traditional fermented cow milk produced and consumed in south west colombia. the main objective of this research was to studied the enterococcal population, present in 13 kumis samples traditionally manufactured, for their role as beneficial organisms or opportunistic pathogens. the molecular identification of 72 isolates evidenced that enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium were the dominant species. the genes gele, esp, asa1, cyl and hyl, all associated with virulence factors in enterococci, were detected in 30 isolates, while 42 were free of virulence determinants. skim milk media were fermented by all the different isolates and further tested for proteolysis (free nh(3) groups), angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory activity and biogenic amines production. nine e. faecalis and two e. faecium strains produced fermented milk with ace-inhibitory activity values ranging from 39.7% to 84.35% .the digestion of fermented milk samples by pepsin and pancreatin evidenced an increase in ace inhibitory activity, with e. faecalis ke09 as the best producer (ic50 = 14.25 mug ml(-1)). moreover, the strains showed a very low tyrosine decarboxylase activity  and did not produce histamine during 48 h fermentation in milk. this study underlines the that colombian kumis is a good source of not virulent enterococci  able to produce fermented milks with ace-inhibitory activity.

TI  == enterococcus populations in artisanal manchego cheese: biodiversity, technological and safety aspects.
AB  == enterococci represent a considerable proportion of the microbiota in manchego cheeses. in this study, a total of 132 enterococci isolated from good quality manchego cheeses from two dairies at different ripening times were genotypically  characterized and identified using molecular techniques. representative isolates  from the clusters obtained after genotyping were assayed for some enzymatic activities considered to have a potential role in cheese ripening, and for 2,3-butanedione and acetoin production, evaluation of odor intensity and appearance in milk and safety evaluation. enterococcus faecalis was the predominant specie, accounting for 81.8% of the total isolates, while enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus avium were present in low proportions. the number of genotypes involved at each ripening time varied both between dairies and with the ripening times; genotype e. faecalis q1 being present in almost all the samples from both dairies. eight isolates showed a higher proteolytic activity and 3 isolates produced high quantities of acetoin-diacetyl, for which reason they are interesting from a technological standpoint. a low antibiotic resistance was found and almost all the strains were susceptible to clinically important antibiotics. on the contrary, only four isolates (e. faecalis c4w1 and n0w5, and e. faecium n32w1 and c16w2) did not harbor some of the virulence genes assayed.

TI  == secondary transfer and expression of vana in enterococcus faecium derived from a  commensal vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium multi-component food isolate.
AB  == we investigated the potential for vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus (vse) from  multi-component salads to disseminate vana from four clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococci to 14 streptogramin-resistant enterococci (sre)  of food and animal origin. strains were selected from a previous study based on the presence of streptogramin susceptibility and/or vana, vanb, vatd, vate, agg,  cpd, and gele genes. transconjugants were isolated on brain heart infusion agar containing vancomycin and selective antibiotics. thirty-nine matings using a 1:10 donor-recipient ratio for filter and broth methods resulted in transfer of vana between an agg(+)cpd(+)gele(+) enterococcus faecalis donor and an agg(-)cpd(-)gele(-) streptogramin-susceptible enterococcus faecium salad recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) per recipient by filter method. secondary mating of the transconjugant with sr/vse strains resulted in a two- to four-log-fold greater frequency of transfer. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed vana rna products in the transconjugant cultivated in nutrient broth and salad at 37 degrees c in the presence and absence of recipient filtrate. this study demonstrated that native salad vse disseminated vana to sre  carrying agg, cpd, and/or gele. an increase in transfer efficiency resulted from  secondary conjugation using the native vancomycin- and streptogramin-susceptible  salad strain as the donor.

TI  == intra- and interspecies genomic transfer of the enterococcus faecalis pathogenicity island.
AB  == enterococci are the third leading cause of hospital associated infections and have gained increased importance due to their fast adaptation to the clinical environment by acquisition of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity traits. enterococcus faecalis harbours a pathogenicity island (pai) of 153 kb containing  several virulence factors including the enterococcal surface protein (esp). until now only internal fragments of the pai or larger chromosomal regions containing it have been transferred. here we demonstrate precise excision, circularization and horizontal transfer of the entire pai element from the chromosome of e. faecalis strain uw3114. this pai (ca. 200 kb) contained some deletions and insertions as compared to the pai of the reference strain mmh594, transferred precisely and integrated site-specifically into the chromosome of e. faecalis (intergenic region) and enterococcus faecium (trnalys). the internal pai structure was maintained after transfer. we assessed phenotypic changes accompanying acquisition of the pai and expression of some of its determinants. the esp gene is expressed on the surface of donor and both transconjugants. biofilm formation and cytolytic activity were enhanced in e. faecalis transconjugants after acquisition of the pai. no differences in pathogenicity of  e. faecalis were detected using a mouse bacteraemia and a mouse peritonitis models (tail vein and intraperitoneal injection). a 66 kb conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid encoding erm(b) (plg2) that was transferred in parallel with the pai was sequenced. plg2 is a pheromone responsive plasmid that  probably promotes the pai horizontal transfer, encodes antibiotic resistance features and contains complete replication and conjugation modules of enterococcal origin in a mosaic-like composition. the e. faecalis pai can undergo precise intra- and interspecies transfer probably with the help of conjugative elements like conjugative resistance plasmids, supporting the role of horizontal  gene transfer and antibiotic selective pressure in the successful establishment of certain enterococci as nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == clinical course and outcomes of single-organism enterococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == background and objectives: enterococci are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. they can cause enteric peritonitis, which is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (pd). however, the clinical course and outcome of pd-related enterococcus peritonitis remains unclear. methods: we reviewed all enterococcus peritonitis episodes occurring in our dialysis unit from 1995 to 2009. results: during the study period, 1421 episodes of peritonitis were recorded. of 29 episodes (2.0%) that were attributable to single-organism enterococcus, 12 episodes were caused by e. faecalis; 9, by e. faecium; and the remaining 8, by other enterococcus species. the overall rate of ampicillin resistance was 41.4%. recent use of antibiotics was associated with the development of ampicillin-resistant enterococcus (are) peritonitis (hazard ratio: 12.53; p = 0.04). the primary response rate of enterococcus peritonitis was significantly higher than that of escherichia coli peritonitis (89.7% vs. 69.9%,  p = 0.038), but the primary response rate was not significantly lower for are peritonitis than for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus (ase) peritonitis (83.3% vs. 94.1%, p = 0.553). however, significantly more patients with are had received vancomycin (83.3% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.003), with a longer mean duration of vancomycin treatment (11.8 +/- 6.9 days vs. 3.7 +/- 6.8 days, p = 0.005). conclusions: recent use of antibiotics was a risk factor for the development of are peritonitis. outcomes in ase and are peritonitis were similar, but vancomycin was required during treatment for are peritonitis, in turn possibly predisposing  the patients to infections caused by vancomycin-resistant organisms.

TI  == genetic basis for daptomycin resistance in enterococci.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant enterococci as a leading cause of hospital-acquired infection is an important public health concern. little is known about the genetic mechanisms by which enterococci adapt to strong selective pressures, including the use of antibiotics. the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin is approved to treat gram-positive bacterial infections, including those caused by enterococci. since its introduction, resistance to daptomycin by  strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium has been reported but is still rare. we evolved daptomycin-resistant strains of the multidrug-resistant e. faecalis strain v583. based on the availability of a fully closed genome sequence for v583, we used whole-genome resequencing to identify the mutations that became fixed over short time scales (~2 weeks) upon serial passage in the presence of daptomycin. by comparison of the genome sequences of the three adapted strains to that of parental v583, we identified seven candidate daptomycin resistance genes and three different mutational paths to daptomycin resistance in e. faecalis. mutations in one of the seven candidate genes (ef0631), encoding a putative cardiolipin synthase, were found in each of the adapted e. faecalis v583 strains as well as in daptomycin-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium clinical isolates. alleles of ef0631 from daptomycin-resistant strains are dominant in trans and confer daptomycin resistance upon a susceptible host. these results demonstrate a mechanism of enterococcal daptomycin resistance that is genetically distinct from that occurring in staphylococci and indicate that enterococci possessing alternate ef0631 alleles are selected for during daptomycin therapy. however, our analysis of e. faecalis clinical isolates indicates that resistance pathways independent from mutant forms of ef0631 also exist.

TI  == conservation of ebp-type pilus genes among enterococci and demonstration of their role in adherence of enterococcus faecalis to human platelets.
AB  == ebp are endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pili of enterococcus faecalis that are also important in experimental urinary tract infections (utis). our analyses, using available genomes, found that the ebp locus is unique to enterococci. in e. faecalis, the ebp locus is very highly conserved and only 1/473 e. faecalis isolates tested lacked ebpabc, while only 1.2% had the bee pilus locus. no other  pilus-encoding operon was identified in 55 available genomes, indicating that the vast majority of e. faecalis strains (unlike enterococcus faecium and streptococci) have a single pilus locus. surface expression studies showed that ebp pili were produced in vitro by 91/91 brain heart infusion (bhi) plus serum-grown e. faecalis isolates and that strain og1rf expressed pili at even higher levels in rat endocarditis vegetations. however, ebp expression was restricted to 30 to 72% of e. faecalis cells, consistent with a bistability mode  of expression. we also evaluated e. faecalis interactions with human platelets and found that growth of e. faecalis in bhi plus serum significantly enhanced adherence to human platelets and that sortase deletion mutants (the deltasrta, deltabps, and deltabpsdeltasrta mutants) were markedly defective. further studies identified that ebp pili, but not the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (mscramms) ace and fss2, mediate adherence of e. faecalis to platelets. taken together, our data show that the immunogenic (in human endocarditis patients) and commonly expressed ebp pili, which are known to  be important for experimental endocarditis, are highly conserved and mediate adherence to platelets, suggesting that ebp pili may be a reasonable immunotherapeutic target for prevention or possibly treatment of endocarditis caused by this species.

AB  == aim: to assess the persistence and diversity of faecal bacterial populations (faecal coliforms and enterococci) that have recently been included in microbial  source tracking (mst) predictive models. methods and results: the analysed bacterial populations included members of the enterococci group (ent) [enterococcus faecium (fm), enterococcus faecalis (fs) and enterococcus hirae (hir)] and the faecal coliform group (fc) [diverse escherichia coli phenotypes (ecp) and cellobiose-negative faecal coliforms (cnfc)]. the inactivation of these distinct groups was monitored over time on-site in river by biochemical fingerprinting, and diversity indices were calculated. among the different analysed species belonging to the ent group, hir persisted longer and was able to replicate in the environment at a higher rate. on the other hand, ecp and ncfc showed a similar persistence throughout the different seasons. the diversity index (di) for fc increased substantially in the summer after 96 h to a maximum value of 0.96. on the other hand, the di for ent diminished over the same period  to a value of 0.86, suggesting a different persistence for the different species  integrating this group. conclusions: the persistence of ecp, cnfc, fm and fs in the aquatic environment is high, particularly for the members of the fc and in the summer season. on the contrary, hir is able to replicate in the environment at a high rate even in winter, and therefore, its inclusion in mst predictive models is discouraged. significance and impact of the study: ecp, cnfc, fmfs and  hir have been proposed as additional variables in mst predictive models. however, the different persistence of hir compared with the other variables should be taken into account for the development of such models.

AB  == introduction: in the past two decades members of the genus enterococcus have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. this study prospectively analyzed the distribution of species and trends in antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci in a brazilian tertiary hospital from 2006-2009. methods: enterococcal species were identified by conventional biochemical tests.  the antimicrobial susceptibility profile was performed by disk diffusion in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). a screening test for vancomycin was also performed. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for vancomycin was determined using the broth dilution method. molecular assays were used to confirm speciation and genotype of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). results: a total of 324 non-repetitive enterococcal isolates were recovered, of which 87% were e. faecalis and 10.8% e.  faecium. the incidence of e. faecium per 1,000 admissions increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.3 in 2006 to 2.3 in 2009. the vre rate also increased over time from 2.5% to 15.5% (p < 0.001). all vre expressed high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic >256 microg/ ml) and harbored vana genes. the majority (89.5%) of vre belonged to e. faecium species, which were characteristically resistant to ampicillin and quinolones. overall, ampicillin resistance rate increased significantly from 2.5% to 21.4% from 2006-2009. resistance rates for gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin significantly decreased over time, although they remained high. quinolones resistance rates were high and did  not change significantly over time. conclusions: the data obtained show a significant increasing trend in the incidence of e. faecium resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin.

TI  == importance of two enterococcus faecium loci encoding gls-like proteins for in vitro bile salts stress response and virulence.
AB  == general stress proteins, gls24 and glsb, were previously shown to be involved in  bile salts resistance of enterococcus faecalis and in virulence. here, we identified 2 gene clusters in enterococcus faecium each encoding a homolog of gls24 (gls33 and gls20; designated on the basis of their predicted sizes) and of  glsb (glsb and glsb1). the sequences of the gls33 and gls20 gene clusters from available genomes indicate distinct lineages, with those of hospital-associated cc17 isolates differing from non-cc17 by approximately 7% and approximately 3.5%, respectively. deletion of an individual locus did not have a significant effect on virulence in a mouse peritonitis model, whereas a double-deletion mutant was highly attenuated (p<.004) versus wild-type. however, mutants lacking either gls33-glsb, gls20-glsb1, or both all exhibited increased sensitivity to bile salts. these results suggest that gls-encoded loci may be important for adaptation to the intestinal environment, in addition to being important for virulence functions.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from broilers infected experimentally with eimeria spp and fed with diets containing different supplements.
AB  == resistant bacteria in animal can be spread to environment and to humans. poultry  feed and infections caused by eimeria spp. are important factors in determining the intestinal microbial communities. the aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of species and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus isolated from broilers fed with different supplements and infected experimentally with eimeria spp. broilers were divided in eight groups, fed with diets supplemented with a combination of antimicrobial, ionophore-coccidiostatics, probiotic, essential oil. at 14 days old all birds, except the control, received a solution  containing oocysts of eimeria spp. samples of cloacal swabs from broilers were collected. a total of 240 enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, confirmed genus by pcr, classified as species, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened by pcr for the presence of tet(l), tet(m) and erm(b) genes. the overall  distribution of species isolated from fecal samples was e. faecalis (40%), followed by e. casseliflavus/e. gallinarum (10.8%), e. mundtii (10.8%), e. faecium (10.8%), e. columbae (5.8%) and e. gallinarum (4.2%). changes in the composition or frequency of enterococcus species were observed in all dietary supplementation. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance phenotypes  a range of antibiotics, especially used in humans such as, streptomycin, penicillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. there was no correlation between different supplementation for broilers and antimicrobial resistance and the presence of tet(m), tet(l) and erm(b) genes. dietary supplementation had effect on the enterococcus sp. colonization, but did not have significant effect on the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated  from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated  at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 micrcog/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, vcm, teicoplanin, linezolid(lzd) and qpr/dpr had mic90s of < or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of e. faecalis strains or 3.5% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to lzd. 24.4% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr. against  all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm were under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity against c. difficile. carbapenems showed good activity against peptococcaceae, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. however since several strains of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the  future.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == bacteriophage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aims: temperate bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that transfer genetic information between bacteria. this phenomenon is known as transduction, and it is important in acquisition of bacterial virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of bacteriophages in gene transfer (antibiotic resistance) in enterococci. methods and results: three bacteriophages from environmental samples isolated on pig host strains of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus faecalis were evaluated in transduction experiments. antibiotic resistance was transferred from ent. gallinarum to ent. faecalis (tetracycline resistance) and from ent. faecalis to enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae/durans and enterococcus casseliflavus (gentamicin resistance). conclusions: bacteriophages play a role in transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants in enterococci. significance and impact of the study: this study confirms previous suggestions on transduction in enterococci, in particular on interspecies transduction. interspecies transduction is significant because it widens the range of recipients involved in antimicrobial resistance transfer.

TI  == isolation of bacteriophages to multi-drug resistant enterococci obtained from diabetic foot: a novel antimicrobial agent waiting in the shelf?
AB  == introduction: while foot infections in persons with diabetes are initially treated empirically, therapy directed at known causative organisms may improve the outcome. many studies have reported on the bacteriology of diabetic foot infections (dfis), but the results have varied and have often been contradictory. the purpose of the research work is to call attention to a frightening twist in the antibiotic-resistant enterococci problem in diabetic foot that has not received adequate attention from the medical fraternity and also the pharmaceutical pipeline for new antibiotics is drying up. materials and methods:  adult diabetic patients admitted for lower extremity infections from july 2008 to december 2009 in the medical wards and intensive care unit of medical teaching hospitals were included in the study. the extent of the lower extremity infection on admission was assessed based on wagner's classification from grades i to v. specimens were collected from the lesions upon admission prior to the initiation  of antibiotic therapy or within the first 48 h of admission. results: during the  18-month prospective study, 32 strains of enterococcus spp. (26 enterococcus faecalis and 06 e. faecium) were recovered. antibiotic sensitivity testing was done by kirby-bauer's disk diffusion method. isolates were screened for high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar). a total of 65.6% of enterococcus species showed hlar. multidrug resistance and concomitant resistance of hlar strains to other antibiotics were quite high. none of the enterococcus species was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: multidrug-resistant enterococci are a real problem and continuous surveillance is necessary. today, resistance has rendered most of the original antibiotics obsolete for many infections, mandating the development of alternative anti-infection modalities. one of such alternatives stemming up from an old idea is the bacteriophage therapy. in the present study, we could able to demonstrate the viable phages against mdr e. faecalis.

TI  == [comparison of microdilution method and phoenix automated system for testing antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococcus strains].
AB  == enterococcus spp. are important pathogens which are intrinsically resistant to most of the commonly used antimicrobial agents such as aminoglycosides and cephalosporins. accurate determination of resistance is important to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy. this study was undertaken to compare the susceptibility results obtained by phoenix system (becton dickinson, usa) with reference microdilution method. we included 1248 enterococcus spp. (903 enterococcus faecalis, 345 enterococcus faecium) strains isolated from clinical samples between 2005-2007 in routine microbiology laboratory of hacettepe university hospital. the strains were identified and the antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by the phoenix system. antimicrobial susceptibilities to ampicillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, gentamicin and streptomycin were also studied by microdilution method according to clinical and  laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. evaluation revealed excellent agreement for all of the antibiotics with category agreement rates of > 97%. among 1248 strains, 76 revealed discordant results. very major error rates were 1.5% for ampicillin, 1.3% for gentamicin, and 0.9% for streptomycin. major error  rates were 1.4% for streptomycin, 0.6% for ampicillin and vancomycin and 0.3% for gentamicin. minor error rates were found as 0.2% for vancomycin, and 0.1% for teicoplanin. resistance rates obtained by microdilution were as follows; high level streptomycin 44%, high level gentamicin 29.7%, ampicillin 25.6%, vancomycin 2.2% and teicoplanin 2.2%. resistance rates were higher in e.faecium than e.faecalis and 96.4% of the vancomycin resistant enterococcus isolates were identified as e.faecium. in conclusion, based on the data obtained, phoenix system is reliable for testing susceptibilities of enterococcus spp. to these antimicrobials. since isolation of vancomycin resistant enterococci has an important impact in terms of hospital infection control, vancomycin resistance reported by the phoenix system should be confirmed with an alternative susceptibility testing method.

TI  == a 1.5 hour procedure for identification of enterococcus species directly from blood cultures.
AB  == enterococci are a common cause of bacteremia with e. faecalis being the predominant species followed by e. faecium. because resistance to ampicillin and  vancomycin in e. faecalis is still uncommon compared to resistance in e. faecium, the development of rapid tests allowing differentiation between enterococcal species is important for appropriate therapy and resistance surveillance. the e.  faecalis oe pna fish assay (advandx, woburn, ma) uses species-specific peptide nucleic acid (pna) probes in a fluorescence in situ hybridization format and offers a time to results of 1.5 hours and the potential of providing important information for species-specific treatment. multicenter studies were performed to assess the performance of the 1.5 hour e. faecalis/oe pna fish procedure compared to the original 2.5 hour assay procedure and to standard bacteriology methods for the identification of enterococci directly from a positive blood culture bottle.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  == a dna microarray (enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. in total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the api 20 strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpa, reca, phes, and ddl represented on our microarray. among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the api 20 strep system:  enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. avium. the enteroarray detected the same species as api 20 strep, as well as two more: e. casseliflavus and e. hirae. species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five api 20 strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven enteroarray identified species. the species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further  robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. the new enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.

TI  == method for rapid and sensitive detection of enterococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis/faecium cells in potable water samples.
AB  == we have developed a rapid and robust technological solution including a membrane  filtration and dissolution method followed by a molecular enrichment and a real-time pcr assay, for detecting the presence of enterococcus sp. or enterococcus faecalis/faecium per 100 ml of water in less than 5 h and we compared it to method 1600 on mei agar in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and  limit of detection. the mei and the enterococcus sp.-specific assay detected respectively 73 (64.0%) and 114 (100%) of the 114 enterococcal strains tested. none of the 150 non-enterococcal strains tested was detected by both methods with the exception of tetragenococcus solitarius for the enterococcus sp. assay. the multiplexed e. faecalis/faecium assay efficiently amplified dna from 47 of 47 (100%) e. faecalis and 27 of 27 (100%) e. faecium strains tested respectively, whereas none of the 191 non-e. faecalis/faecium strains tested was detected. by simultaneously detecting the predominant fecal enterococcal species, the e. faecalis/faecium-specific assay allows a better distinction between enterococcal  strains of fecal origin and those provided by the environment than method 1600. our procedure allows the detection of 4.5 enterococcal colony forming units (cfu) per 100 ml in less than 5 h, whereas the mei method detected 2.3 cfu/100 ml in 24 h (95% confidence). thus, our innovative and highly effective method provides a rapid and easy approach to concentrate very low numbers of enterococcal cells present in a 100 ml water sample and allows a better distinction between fecal and environmental enterococcal cells than method 1600.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of enterococci strains isolated from urine samples to fosfomycin and other antibiotics.
AB  == enterococci are mostly isolated from urinary tract infections (utis). increasing  antibiotic resistance affects the success rate in empirical treatment, thus makes antibiotic susceptibility tests important. the aim of this study was to determine the species distribution and resistance patterns of enterococcus strains isolated from urine samples to antibacterial agents including fosfomycin in a teaching hospital, istanbul. the identification of 100 enterococcus strains were determined by using conventional methods and api 20 strep (biomerieux france). the susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion and etest. the majority of isolates were e. faecalis (67%), followed by e. faecium (33%). the ratio of e. faecalis to e. faecium was 2.03/1. e. faecalis and e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillin (38.8, 93.9%), ampicillin (4.8, 84.8%), vancomycin (1.5, 18.2%), teicoplanin (1.5, 18.2%), gentamicin (13.4, 58%), ciprofloxacin (34.3, 84.8%), levofloxacin (34.3, 87.9%), norfloxacin (38.8, 84.8%), tetracycline (89.6, 48.5%), nitrofurantoin (1.5, 39.4%), and fosfomycin (2.3, 0%) (p < 0.0001), respectively. resistance to fosfomycin was observed in neither e. faecium strains, nor vancomycine-resistant enterococci strains. it was concluded  that, enterococci are important pathogens for uti; species identification and periodic evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility pattern would be guide for early empirical treatment and in uncomplicated uti, fosfomycin could be an alternative  option for therapy.

TI  == multidrug-resistant enterococci in animal meat and faeces and co-transfer of resistance from an enterococcus durans to a human enterococcus faecium.
AB  == forty-eight isolates resistant to at least two antibiotics were selected from 53  antibiotic-resistant enterococci from chicken and pig meat and faeces and analysed for specific resistance determinants. of the 48 multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains, 31 were resistant to two antibiotics (29 to erythromycin and tetracycline, 1 to erythromycin and vancomycin, 1 to vancomycin and tetracycline), 14 to three (erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin or ampicillin) and 3 to four (erythromycin, vancomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin).  erm(b), tet(m), vana and aac (6')-ie aph (2'')-ia were the antibiotic resistance  genes most frequently detected. all 48 mdr enterococci were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin. enterococcus faecalis (16), enterococcus faecium (8), enterococcus mundtii (2) and enterococcus gallinarum (1) were identified in meat, and e. faecium (13) and enterococcus durans (13) in faeces. clonal spread was not detected, suggesting a large role of gene transfer in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. conjugative transfer of resistance genes was more successful when donors were enterococcal strains isolated from faeces; co-transfer of vana and erm(b) to a human e. faecium occurred from both e. faecium and e. durans pig faecal strains. these data show that multidrug resistance can be found in food and animal species other than e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that these species can efficiently transfer antibiotic resistance to human strains in inter-specific matings. in particular, the occurrence of mdr  e. durans in the animal reservoir could have a role in the emergence of human enterococcal infections difficult to eradicate with antibiotics.

TI  == insects in confined swine operations carry a large antibiotic resistant and potentially virulent enterococcal community.
AB  == background: extensive use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the livestock industry constitutes strong selection pressure for evolution and selection of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. unfortunately, the microbial ecology and  spread of these bacteria in the agricultural, urban, and suburban environments are poorly understood. insects such as house flies (musca domestica) and german cockroaches (blattella germanica) can move freely between animal waste and food and may play a significant role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria within and between animal production farms and from farms to residential settings. results: enterococci from the digestive tract of house flies (n = 162), and feces of german cockroaches (n = 83) and pigs (n = 119), collected from two commercial swine farms were isolated, quantified, identified, and screened for antibiotic resistance and virulence. the majority of samples (93.7%) were positive for enterococci with concentrations 4.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cfu/house fly, 5.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) cfu/g of cockroach feces, and 3.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) cfu/g of pig feces. among all the identified isolates (n = 639) enterococcus faecalis was  the most common (55.5%), followed by e. hirae (24.9%), e. faecium (12.8%), and e. casseliflavus (6.7%). e. faecalis was most prevalent in house flies and cockroaches, and e. hirae was most common in pig feces. our data showed that multi-drug (mainly tetracycline and erythromycin) resistant enterococci were common from all three sources and frequently carried antibiotic resistance genes  including tet(m) and erm(b) and tn916/1545 transposon family. e. faecalis frequently harbored virulence factors gele, esp, and asa1. pfge analysis of selected e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates demonstrated that cockroaches and house flies shared some of the same enterococcal clones that were detected in the swine manure indicating that insects acquired enterococci from swine manure. conclusions: this study shows that house flies and german cockroaches in the confined swine production environment likely serve as vectors and/or reservoirs of antibiotic resistant and potentially virulent enterococci and consequently may play an important role in animal and public health.

TI  == application of pfge to source tracking of faecal pollution in coastal recreation  area: a case study in aoshima beach, japan.
AB  == aims: the development of a microbial source tracking (mst) method is strongly desired to ensure public health and bacteriological safety in coastal recreation  areas. we try to specify the source of faecal pollution by applying pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) to the study of the aquatic environment on aoshima beach, japan. methods and results: enterococcus faecium, an enterococcus, was used as a faecal indicator bacterium in this study. enterococcus faecium strains  were isolated and identified from each water sample collected from aoshima beach  and five rivers (oyodo, kiyotake, kaeda, chifuku and tsukunami rivers) that might be potential sources of faecal pollution. enterococcus faecium strains collected  from water samples were analysed using pfge. the similarities of all the pfge types of the ent. faecium strains were compared using dendrogram analysis. the pfge types of the strains isolated from aoshima beach showed a high similarity to those of the strains isolated from the oyodo river at a 0.9 similarity level. it  was suggested that the oyodo river is the source of faecal pollution on aoshima beach. conclusions: the pfge analysis using enterococci is a potential tool for the mst of faecal indicator bacteria that can be applied to the study of the coastal environment. significance and impact of the study: this is one of the studies that pfge was applied to the coastal environment. the approach using pfge could estimate the river that is source of faecal pollution in aoshima beach. by  applying pfge as a tool of mst method, detailed information of faecal pollution in coastal area can be provided.

TI  == vancomycin-resistance transferability from vana enterococci to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == in last decade methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with high level of vancomycin-resistance (vrsa) have been reported and generally the patients with vrsa infection were also infected with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). considering that the high level of vancomycin-resistance in vrsa isolates seems to involve the horizontal transfer of tn1546 transposon containing vana gene from coinfecting vre strains, the authors have studied the "in vitro" conjugative transfer of this resistance from vana enterococci to s. aureus. out of 25 matings performed combining five vancomycin-resistant enterococci as donors (three enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium), and five s. aureus as recipients, all clinical isolates, two have been successful using e. faecalis as  donor. the transfer of vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by vana gene amplification in both transconjugants and the resistance was expressed at lower levels (mic 32 mug/ml) in comparison with the respective vre donors (mic > 128 mug/ml). the vancomycin-resistance of trasconjugants was maintained even after subsequent overnight passages on msa plates containing subinhibitory levels of vancomycin. this study shows that the vana gene transfer can be achieved through  techniques "in vitro" without the use of laboratory animals employed, in the only similar experiment previously carried out by other authors, as substrate for the  trasconjugant growth. moreover, in that previous experiment, contrary to this study, the vancomycin resistant s. aureus trasconjugants were selected on erythromycin agar and not by direct vancomycin agar selection.

TI  == human and swine hosts share vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium cc17 and cc5 and enterococcus faecalis cc2 clonal clusters harboring tn1546 on indistinguishable plasmids.
AB  == vre isolates from pigs (n = 29) and healthy persons (n = 12) recovered during wide surveillance studies performed in portugal, denmark, spain, switzerland, and the united states (1995 to 2008) were compared with outbreak/prevalent vre clinical strains (n = 190; 23 countries; 1986 to 2009). thirty clonally related enterococcus faecium clonal complex 5 (cc5) isolates (17 sequence type 6 [st6], 6 st5, 5 st185, 1 st147, and 1 st493) were obtained from feces of swine and healthy humans. this collection included isolates widespread among pigs of european union (eu) countries since the mid-1990s. each st comprised isolates showing similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns (</=6 bands difference; >82% similarity). some cc5 pfge subtype strains from swine were indistinguishable from hospital vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) causing infections. a truncated variant of tn1546 (encoding resistance to vancomycin) and tcrb (coding for resistance to copper) were consistently located on 150- to 190-kb plasmids (rep(plg1)). e. faecium cc17 (st132) isolates from pig manure and two clinical samples showed identical pfge profiles and contained a 60-kb mosaic plasmid (rep(inc18) plus rep(prum)) carrying diverse tn1546-is1216 variants. the only enterococcus faecalis isolate obtained from pigs (cc2-st6) corresponded to a multidrug-resistant clone widely disseminated in hospitals in italy, portugal, and spain, and both animal and human isolates harbored an indistinguishable 100-kb mosaic plasmid (rep(pre25) plus rep(pcf10)) containing the whole tn1546 backbone. the results indicate a current intra- and international spread of e. faecium and e. faecalis clones and their plasmids among swine and humans.

TI  == virulence factors in enterococci from partridges (alectoris rufa) representing a  food safety problem.
AB  == forty-three enterococcus isolates recovered from fecal samples of partridges, during the partridge hunting season, were studied for gelatinase and beta-hemolysis activities. the presence of fsr-gele genes and the cyl operon was  studied by polymerase chain reaction and correlated with gelatinase and beta-hemolysis production, respectively. in addition, genes encoding additional virulence factors (cpd, hyl, agg, esp, and ace) was also analyzed in all enterococci. most of our enterococcus faecalis isolates showed gelatinase activity (10 of 15 isolates), and this activity was not present in the other enterococcal species. all enterococci that showed gelatinase activity harbored the gele and fsr genes. a large proportion of our isolates harbored genes of the  cyl operon (19 of 43 isolates), although only 1 isolate contained the five cyl tested genes (e. faecalis), being the only one that expressed beta-hemolysis. from the additional virulence factors (cpd, hyl, agg, esp, and ace), at least one virulence gene was detected in 13 of the 15 e. faecalis isolates, with cpd being  the most frequently detected gene (9 isolates), followed by agg (5 isolates) and  ace (4 isolates) genes. these virulence genes were not detected in the other enterococcal species with the exception of one e. faecium and e. casseliflavus isolate that harbored the hyl and cpd genes, respectively. moreover, the esp gene was not detected in any of our isolates. in conclusion, this study showed the presence of virulence factors in enterococci of partridges and the possible transmission to humans through the food chain.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic resistant enterococci isolated from untreated waters for human consumption in portugal.
AB  == untreated drinking water is frequently overlooked as a source of antibiotic resistance in developed countries. to gain further insight on this topic, we isolated the indicator bacteria enterococcus spp. from water samples collected in wells, fountains and natural springs supplying different communities across portugal, and characterized their antibiotic resistance profile with both phenotypic and genetic approaches. we found various rates of resistance to seven  antibiotic families. over 50% of the isolates were resistant to at least ciprofloxacin, tetracyclines or quinupristin-dalfopristin and 57% were multidrug  resistant to >/=3 antibiotics from different families. multiple enterococcal species (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. casseliflavus and other enterococcus spp) from different water samples harbored genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines, erythromycin or gentamicin [tet(m)-46%, tet(l)-14%, tet(s)-5%,  erm(b)-22%, aac(6 )-ie-aph(2'')-12%] and putative virulence factors [gel-28%, asa1-16%]. the present study positions untreated drinking water within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be reservoirs of or vehicles for antibiotic resistant enterococci/genes. these findings are worthy of attention as spread of antibiotic resistant enterococci to humans and animals through water ingestion cannot be dismissed.

TI  == host range of enterococcal vana plasmids among gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vana transposon tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in  enterococcus faecium. the limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. we investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vana-containing plasmids hosted by e. faecium (n = 9), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. methods: a filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. donor strains were mated with three e. faecium recipients,  three e. faecalis recipients, a lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a lactococcus lactis recipient and two bifidobacterium recipients. transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. results: in total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. in  summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. all recipients of the same species behaved similarly. inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pip501/pambeta1) only. acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in  the new host. conclusions: intra-species transfer of enterococcal vana plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vana-containing plasmids among e. faecium. a  reservoir of vana plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.

TI  == telavancin activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == telavancin is approved in the united states and canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) in adults caused by susceptible gram-positive organisms. the antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) gram-positive bacteria responsible for sssi in medical centers in asia-pacific, european, latin american, and north american regions. telavancin was active against staphylococcus aureus (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a vanb phenotype, at </= 1 mg/l (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a vana phenotype (mic, >2 mg/l). vancomycin-susceptible and vanb vancomycin-resistant e. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/l, while this drug exhibited elevated mic values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against e. faecium of vana phenotype (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). telavancin was potent  against beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0%  susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). these in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the  treatment of csssi caused by the indicated pathogens.

TI  == [is the iron an essential nutrient for enterococci?].
AB  == enterococci were considered as not requiring iron. the aim of study was evaluation of relationship between enterococci and iron. this study examined these relationships in a 71 strains belonging to two species--enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, which are often isolated from human infections. the iron is an essential nutrient for enterococci. demonstrated that  iron--regardless of the concentration in the medium--is collected during growth.  iron deficiency in the nutrient medium resulted in changes in the kinetics of growth of enterococci. inhibiting the growth of enterococci by iron chelators and lack of inhibition are further proof of this demand for iron bacteria. enterococci have the ability to acquire this important element of its connections with natural and synthetic chetators with different strength of chemical bonding  and structure. bacteria of the genus enterococcus have a natural resistance to many antimicrobial agents. in the hospital environment can easily acquire resistance genes to many other classes of antimicrobial compounds. for these reasons, treatment of enterococal infections poses more difficulties. inhibition  of iron uptake in enterococci can be helpful in reducing and combating enterococal infections.

TI  == characterization of lytic enzyme open reading frame 9 (orf9) derived from enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage phief24c.
AB  == in bacteriophage (phage) therapy against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, members of a genus of spo1-like viruses are typically employed because of their extreme virulence and broad host spectrum. phage phief24c, which is a spo1-like virus infecting e. faecalis, has previously been characterized as a therapeutic phage candidate. in addition to the phage itself, phage endolysin is also recognized as an effective antimicrobial agent. in this study, a putative endolysin gene (orf9) of e. faecalis phage phief24c was analyzed in silico, and its activity was characterized using the recombinant form. first, bioinformatics analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 (orf9) protein is n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. second, bacteriolytic and bactericidal activities of orf9 against e. faecalis were confirmed by zymography, decrease of  peptidoglycan turbidity, decrease of the viable count, and morphological analysis of orf9-treated cells. third, orf9 did not appear to require zn(2+) ions for its  activity, contrary to the bioinformatics prediction of a zn(2+) ion requirement.  fourth, the lytic spectrum was from 97.1% (34 out of 35 strains, including vancomycin-resistant strains) of e. faecalis strains to 60% (6 out of 10 strains) of enterococcus faecium strains. fifth, n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of orf9 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and the subsequent maldi-postsource decay (psd) analyses. finally, functional analysis using n- or c-terminally deleted orf9 mutants suggested that a complete orf9 molecule is essential for its activity. these results suggested that orf9 is an endolysin of  phage phief24c and can be a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six  staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus [visa] strain) and three enterococcus sp. strains (1 enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium [vref] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus (vssa) strains or all 4 mrsa strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (aubkc(24)) and 48 h (aubkc(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (p  < 0.05). telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (p < 0.05). against the three enterococcus spp.  tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its aubkc(24), aubkc(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (p < 0.05). dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over  24 h in the steady state divided by the mic (fauc/mic) exposures from 0 to 1,617  (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 vssa, 4 visa, and the 3 enterococcus strains. the fauc/mic values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 +/- 38.4 and 50.0 +/- 39.0 for vssa, 3.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.3 +/- 1.3 for visa, and 15.1 +/- 8.8 and 40.1 +/- 29.4 for the enterococcus spp., respectively. the reason for the paradoxically low fauc/mic values for visa strains is unknown. there was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2x mic telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with s. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fauc/mic ratios of 1 to 10. maintaining a fauc/mic ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. these data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against mrsa and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against enterococcus spp., and perhaps also visa, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. in addition, they support a  clinical breakpoint of sensitive at </=1 mg/liter for both s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == the occurrence of virulence traits among high-level aminoglycosides resistant enterococcus isolates obtained from feces of humans, animals, and birds in south  korea.
AB  == enterococcus isolates (1500) obtained from the feces of 48 humans, 209 domesticated food animals, and 155 wild geese in south korea were characterized with respect to species status by pcr analyses and resistance to antibiotics. of  the 1500 strains examined, the majority (n=577) were enterococcus faecalis from 224 (54.4%) of the samples feces, while 299 were of e. faecium from 125 of the samples (30.3%), 224 were e. hirae from 101 (24.5%) of the samples, 94 were e. casseliflavus from 43 (10.4%) of the samples, and one was e. gallinarum. while 305 isolated from 125 (30.3%) of the samples were unidentified species. approximately 15, 60, 50, 55, 3, and 40% of samples obtained from beef cattle, chickens, ducks, swine, wild geese, and humans, respectively, yielded enterococcus isolates that were resistant to high-levels of aminoglycosides (i.e., of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, minimum inhibitory concentrations were >1000 mg/l). the 180 enterococcus isolates that showed high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (hlar) were screened for virulence genes encoding for aggregation substance (agg), cytolysin activator (cyla), gelatinase (gele) and surface protein (esp). of those, the gele gene was  found most frequently in chickens and ducks of the hlar isolates, while 56 e. faecalis and 13 e. faecium hlar were gelatinase positive and showed hemolysin activity. multiple antibiotic resistant enterococcus isolates carrying virulence  genes were most frequently isolated from poultry and swine, and were mostly e. faecalis or e. faecium. these findings suggest that restriction of the use of antibiotics in food animal operations in south korea, especially those involved in poultry and swine production would be desirable.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of solithromycin (cem-101), a novel fluoroketolide: activity against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  == solithromycin (cem-101) is a novel fluoroketolide with high potency against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. in this study, solithromycin and comparator antimicrobials were tested against a contemporary collection of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and other enterococcus spp. collected in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. solithromycin was active against s. aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=0.12 mug/ml] and was two-fold more active than telithromycin (mic(50)=0.25 mug/ml). solithromycin was more potent against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible s. aureus [mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml and mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.12 mug/ml) compared with methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)=0.12 mug/ml and mic(90)>16 mug/ml). solithromycin activity was reduced amongst heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate  s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). against strains with defined susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin and telithromycin, solithromycin showed potent inhibition against all combinations (mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml) except those with non-susceptibility to telithromycin (>2 mug/ml) (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). the solithromycin mic(50) for e. faecium (1 mug/ml) was four-fold higher than the mic(50) for e. faecalis (0.25 mug/ml). in summary, solithromycin demonstrated high potency against many staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. isolated from contemporary infections worldwide.

TI  == multidrug-resistant enterococci lack crispr-cas.
AB  == clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) provide bacteria and archaea with sequence-specific, acquired defense against plasmids and phage. because mobile elements constitute up to 25% of the genome of multidrug-resistant (mdr) enterococci, it was of interest to examine the codistribution of crispr and acquired antibiotic resistance in enterococcal lineages. a database was built from 16 enterococcus faecalis draft genome sequences to identify commonalities and polymorphisms in the location and content of crispr loci. with this data set, we were able to detect identities between crispr spacers and sequences from mobile elements, including pheromone-responsive plasmids and phage, suggesting that crispr regulates the flux of these elements through the e. faecalis species. based on conserved locations of crispr and crispr-cas loci and the discovery of a new crispr locus with associated functional genes, crispr3-cas, we screened additional e. faecalis strains for crispr content, including isolates predating the use of antibiotics. we found a highly significant inverse correlation between the presence of a crispr-cas locus and acquired antibiotic resistance in e. faecalis, and examination of an additional eight e. faecium genomes yielded similar results for that species. a mechanism for crispr-cas loss in e. faecalis was identified. the inverse relationship between crispr-cas and antibiotic resistance suggests that antibiotic use inadvertently selects for enterococcal strains with compromised genome defense.

AB  == we studied 138 glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) strains, consisting of 131 glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium (grefm) and 7 glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecalis (grefs). the grefm strains were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin, while the grefs strains were only resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the van a gene was the only glycopeptide determinant present in all gre isolates investigated. genes coding for hyl and hyl+ esp were detected in 39 (29.8%) and 92 (70.2%) of the 131 grefm isolates, respectively. three of the 7 grefs were positive for gele+asa 1 genes, 3 for gel e gene, and 1 for asa 1 gene. the genetic relationship between the 138 gre was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). grefm isolates were clustered in a single genogroup (pulsotype a), and grefs were clustered in six genogroups (pulsotypes b-g). among the isolates investigated by mlst, only 18 pcr products were sequenced (12 e. faecium and 6 e. faecalis), and 9 sequence types (sts) were identified.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. as legislation of the european union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. in this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from  396 cloacal swabs from 99 swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. on each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. all antimicrobial classes recommended by the european food safety authority for e. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. sixty per cent of the e. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. in e. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in e. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. in these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on  resistance in laying hens is low.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in enterococcus spp. and characterization of isolates from broiler chickens.
AB  == enterococci are now frequent causative agents of nosocomial infections. in this study, we analyzed the frequency and distribution of antibiotic resistance and virulence genotypes of enterococcus isolates from broiler chickens. fecal and cecal samples from nine commercial poultry farms were collected to quantify total enterococci. sixty-nine presumptive enterococci were isolated and identified by api 20 strep, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics were determined. genotypes were assessed through the use of a novel dna microarray carrying 70 taxonomic, 17 virulence, and 174 antibiotic resistance gene probes. total enterococcal counts were different from farm to farm and between sample sources (p < 0.01). fifty-one (74%) of the isolates were identified as e. faecium, whereas nine (13%), seven (10%), and two (3%) isolates were identified as e. hirae, e. faecalis, and e. gallinarum, respectively. multiple-antibiotic resistance was evident in e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates. the most common multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype was bac ery tyl lin str gen tet cip. genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside (aac, aaca-aphd, aadb, apha, sat4), macrolide (erma, ermb, ermam, msrc), tetracycline (tetl, tetm, teto), streptogramin (satg_vate8), bacitracin (bcrr), and lincosamide (linb) antibiotics were detected in corresponding phenotypes. a range of 9 to 12 different virulence genes was found in e. faecalis, including ace, agg, agrb(efs) (agrb gene of e. faecalis), cad1, the cam373 and ccf10 genes, cob, cpd1, cylab, efaa(efs), and gele. all seven e. faecalis isolates were found to carry the gele gene and to hydrolize gelatin and bile salts. results from this study showed the presence of  enterococci of public and environmental health concerns in broiler chicken farms  and demonstrated the utility of a microarray to quickly and reliably analyze resistance and virulence genotypes of enterococcus spp.

TI  == a multiresistance megaplasmid plg1 bearing a hylefm genomic island in hospital enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  == enterococcus faecium is considered to be a nosocomial pathogen with increasing medical importance. the putative virulence factor, hyl(efm), encoding a putative  hyaluronidase, is enriched among the hospital-associated polyclonal subpopulation of e. faecium.. the hyl(efm) gene is described to be part of a genomic island and was recently identified to be plasmid-located. here, we present a description of  the structure, localization, and distribution of the putative pathogenicity factor hyl(efm) and its putative island among 39 clinical isolates and elucidate  the composition and host range of plg1, a hyl(efm) multiresistance plasmid of approximately 281.02kb. the hyl(efm) gene was located within a 17,824-bp element  highly similar to the putative genomic island (gi) structure that had been previously described. this genomic region was conserved among 39 hyl(efm)-positive strains with variation in a specific region downstream of hyl(efm) in 18 strains. the putative hyl(efm) was located on large plasmids (150-350kb) in 37 strains. plg1 could be horizontally transferred into four different e. faecium recipient strains (n=4) but not into e. faecalis (n=3). sequencing of plg1 resolved putative plasmid replication, conjugation, and maintenance determinants as well as a pilin gene cluster, carbon uptake and utilization genes, heavy metal and antibiotic resistance clusters. the hyl(efm) transferable plasmid plg1 bears additional putative pathogenicity factors and antibiotic resistance genes. these findings suggest horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance gene clusters by a single genetic event (conjugative transfer) which might be triggered by heavy antibiotic use common in health care units where e. faecium is increasingly prevalent.

TI  == antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance in commensal enterococci isolated from pigs.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. in this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. only enterococcus gallinarum and  enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the enterococcus faecium isolates. zinc  resistance was largely confined to enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in e. faecalis in comparison with the other species. tiamulin resistance was common in all species except e. casseliflavus. resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most e. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus and e. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of e. faecalis. no teto, rplc, rpld, vana, vanb, vata and vatd genes were found. the presence of ermb, tetl, tetm, tcrb, aac6-aph2, tetk, tets, vanc1, vanc2, lsaa, lsab and vate varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. the findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.

AB  == introduction: enterococci, particularly enterococcus faecalis, are still a primary concern in endodontic infections. to date, enterococci have been considered to be only transiently present in the oral cavity. the aim of this study was to examine whether different enterococci from food are able to reside in oral biofilm. methods: six healthy volunteers wore dental splints loaded with  enamel slabs. after 3 days, the volunteers consumed cheese containing enterococci. the fate of the enterococci was analyzed by culture technique and 16s rrna gene sequencing. all isolates were characterized genotypically by macrorestriction analysis (smai) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. e. faecalis was also analyzed by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). results: e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, and e. durans were detected in the initial biofilm after 2 hours, as well as in the 5-day-old oral biofilm. e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium isolated from the initial biofilm and from the 5-day-old biofilm, as well as those isolated from cheese, showed genetic homogeneity. e. faecium and e. avium had integrated into a pre-existing 3-day-old biofilm. no genetic similarity between e. durans strains isolated from cheese and those from the initial and 5-day-old oral biofilm was detected. e. faecalis was also detected in the oral biofilm by using fish. conclusions: food-borne enterococci, particularly e. faecalis, might not only be transient but could also survive in the oral biofilm and become a source for endodontic infections. moreover, genotypic analysis is required to study the source of oral enterococci.

AB  == enterococcus species are common in nosocomial bloodstream infections and their incidence is rising. although well recognized in several serious bacterial infections, the influence of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in enterococcal bacteraemia has not been fully settled. the aim of the study was to determine whether administration of inappropriate antibiotics in enterococcal bacteraemia is an independent risk factor for mortality, among other known and suspected risk factors. we conducted a cohort study of e. faecalis/faecium bacteraemia during a  3-year period at a single tertiary care hospital in denmark. patients with growth of non-enterococcus co-pathogens apart from the enterococcal bacteraemia were also included, as were patients with repeated enterococcal bacteraemia. time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was counted from the first episode. appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as any therapy with documented clinical effect, in vitro activity and a minimum treatment length of 6 days. multivariate regression  models were built to determine the independent risk factors for mortality. we included 196 patients with enterococcal bacteraemia. appropriate antibiotics for  at least 6 days were administered in 146 of these (74%). thirty-day mortality was 26%. multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality: appropriate antimicrobial therapy for >/= 6 days (odds ratio for mortality 0.33, 0.14-0.79), icu admission (4.2, 1.7-10), thrombocytopenia (3.9, 1.6-9.3), chronic liver failure (3.3, 1.1-10) and age >/= 60 years (2.2, 0.99-5.0). antibiotics not appropriately covering enterococci are frequently administered empirically in suspected bloodstream infections. inappropriate antibiotic therapy was an independent risk factor for mortality in enterococcal bacteraemia.

TI  == frequency of virulence genes and antibiotic resistances in enterococcus spp. isolates from wastewater and feces of domesticated mammals and birds, and wildlife.
AB  == enterococci are gastrointestinal tract residents and also an important cause of nosocomial infections. to understand which species, virulence determinants, and antibiotic resistances are prevalent in enterococci shed by various hosts groups, a total of 1460 strains isolated from 144 fecal samples obtained from wastewater, domesticated mammals and birds, and wildlife were characterized. identification of isolates to the species level showed that enterococcus faecalis was dominant in domesticated mammals and birds and wildlife feces, whereas enterococcus faecium was dominant among wastewater isolates, and that no single enterococcus species could be associated with a specific host group. the frequency of 12 virulence determinants was evaluated among isolates, but no single virulence determinant could be associated with a specific host group. resistance to 12 antibiotics was evaluated among isolates, and it was shown that the highest frequency of resistance at breakpoint concentration was found in domesticated mammals and birds (p &le; 0.05 for 4 antibiotics). our results suggests that (1)  species identification and virulence typing of enterococcus spp. isolates are not useful for the identification of the host groups responsible for fecal contamination of water by microbial source tracking and that (2) antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary, or animal husbandry practices is promoting resistance.

AB  == grape skin extracts of riesling vitis vinifera l. grapes from conventionally or organically managed cultivars were compared on the basis of their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties and pesticide loads. promising results on their biological properties suggest that those extracts would be valuable as food preservatives. the antioxidant capacity  of conventional extracts was significantly higher, according to the higher content in catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin b. pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. both extracts inhibited the growth of gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to similar  extents. possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen iq by means of the ames test. due to the presence of fungicides, the conidial germination of penicillium expansum, penicillium chrysogenum and aspergillus niger, were inhibited by 95% by conventional gse, while negligible effects were observed with organic grape extracts. the latter, however, showed inhibitory effects against trichoderma viridie and aspergillus versicolor.

AB  == background: enterococci have emerged as the third most common cause of nosocomial infections, requiring bactericidal antimicrobial therapy. although vancomycin resistance is a major problem in clinics and has emerged in an important extend in farm animals, few studies have examined it in wild animals. to determine the prevalence of vana-containing enterococcus strains among faecal samples of seagulls (larus cachinnans) of berlengas natural reserve of portugal, we developed a proteomic approach integrated with genomic data. the purpose was to detect the maximum number of proteins that vary in different enterococci species  which are thought to be connected in some, as yet unknown, way to antibiotic resistance. results: from the 57 seagull samples, 54 faecal samples showed the presence of enterococcus isolates (94.7%). for the enterococci, e. faecium was the most prevalent species in seagulls (50%), followed by e. faecalis and e. durans (10.4%), and e. hirae (6.3%). vana-containing enterococcal strains were detected in 10.5% of the 57 seagull faecal samples studied. four of the vana-containing enterococci were identified as e. faecium and two as e. durans. the tet(m) gene was found in all five tetracycline-resistant vana strains. the erm(b) gene was demonstrated in all six erythromycin-resistant vana strains. the  hyl virulence gene was detected in all four vana-containing e. faecium isolates in this study, and two of them harboured the purk1 allele. in addition these strains also showed ampicillin and ciprofoxacin resistance. the whole-cell proteomic profile of vana-containing enterococcus strains was applied to evaluate the discriminatory power of this technique for their identification. the major differences among species-specific profiles were found in the positions corresponding to 97-45 kda. sixty individualized protein spots for each vana isolate was identified and suitable for peptide mass fingerprinting measures by spectrometry measuring (maldi/tof ms) and their identification through bioinformatic databases query. the proteins were classified in different groups according to their biological function: protein biosynthesis, atp synthesis, glycolysis, conjugation and antibiotic resistance. taking into account the origin of these strains and its relation to infectious processes in humans and animals,  it is important to explore the proteome of new strains which might serve as protein biomarkers for biological activity. conclusions: the comprehensive description of proteins isolated from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and e. durans may provide new targets for development of antimicrobial agents. this knowledge may help to identify new biomarkers of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors.

TI  == horizontal gene transfer and the genomics of enterococcal antibiotic resistance.
AB  == enterococci are gram-positive bacteria that normally colonize gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals. they are of growing concern because of their ability to cause antibiotic resistant hospital infections. antibiotic resistance  has been acquired, and has disseminated throughout enterococci, via horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements. this transmission has been mediated mainly by conjugative plasmids of the pheromone-responsive and broad host range incompatibility group 18 type. genome sequencing is revealing the extent of diversity of these and other mobile elements in enterococci, as well as the extent of recombination and rearrangement resulting in new phenotypes. pheromone-responsive plasmids were recently shown to promote genome plasticity in antibiotic resistant enterococcus faecalis, and their involvement has been implicated in e. faecium as well. further, incompatibility group 18 plasmids have recently played an important role in mediating transfer of vancomycin resistance  from enterococci to methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus.

AB  == inducible vancomycin resistance in enterococci is due to a sophisticated mechanism that combines synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with low  affinity for glycopeptides and elimination of the normal target precursors. although this dual mechanism, which involves seven genes organized in two operons, is predicted to have a high fitness cost, resistant enterococci have disseminated worldwide. we have evaluated the biological cost of vanb-type resistance due to acquisition of conjugative transposon tn1549 in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. because fitness was dependent on the integration site of tn1549, an isogenic set of e. faecalis was constructed to determine the cost of inducible or constitutive expression of resistance or of carriage of tn1549. a luciferase gene was inserted in the integrase gene of the transposon to allow differential quantification of the strains in cocultures and  in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice. both in vitro and in vivo, carriage of inactivated or inducible tn1549 had no cost for the host in the absence of induction by vancomycin. in contrast, induced or constitutively resistant strains not only had reduced fitness but were severely impaired in colonization ability and dissemination among mice. these data indicate that tight regulation of resistance expression drastically reduces the biological cost associated with vancomycin resistance in enterococcus spp. and accounts for the widespread dissemination of these strains. our findings are in agreement with the observation that regulation of expression is common in horizontally acquired resistance and represents an efficient evolutionary pathway for resistance determinants to become selectively neutral.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of panduratin a against enterococci clinical isolates.
AB  == panduratin a, a natural chalcone compound isolated from the rhizome of fingerroot (boesenbergia rotunda (l.) mansf. a). the antibacterial activity of panduratin a  against clinical enterococci isolates was compared in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to those of commonly used antimicrobials, according to the clsi guidelines. time-kill curves  were constructed to assess the concentration between mic and bactericidal activity of panduratin a at concentrations ranging from 0x mic to 4x mic. the activity of panduratin a against biofilm-producing enterococcal strains was also  evaluated. the growth of all clinical enterococci isolates (n=23) were inhibited  by panduratin a at a concentration of 2 microg/ml. panduratin a was able to kill  all clinical enterococci isolates with a mbc of 8 microg/ml. the time-kill curves demonstrated that the bactericidal endpoint for clinical enterococci was reached  after 30 min of incubation at a panduratin a concentration of 4x mic. the growth  of biofilm-producing enterococcal strains can be inhibited and eradicated by panduratin a at concentrations of <or=4 microg/ml and <or=16 microg/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of panduratin a against all clinical enterococci isolates was generally more potent than commonly used antimicrobials. panduratin a has stronger activity against biofilm-producing enterococcal strains than daptomycin and linezolid. panduratin a is an antimicrobial agent with high in vitro activity against clinical enterococci, including organisms resistant to  other antimicrobials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and occurrence of bacteriocin structural genes in enterococcus spp. of human and animal origin isolated in portugal.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to detect the antimicrobial activity and the presence of bacteriocin structural genes in 224 enterococcal isolates from fecal  origin obtained from humans, pets, wild animals and birds. direct antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes cect4032 was detected in 102 (45.6%) of the tested isolates. from these, only 22 displayed bacteriocin activity against this indicator. the bacteriocinogenic strains contained one or more of the bacteriocin structural genes tested in this study, with those of enterocins p, a  and l50 (l50a and l50b) being the most abundant. our results show a high occurrence of the combination of different bacteriocin structural genes in the enterococcal isolates analyzed, indicating an elevated genetic potential of these strains to produce various bacteriocins.

TI  == coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus as predominant pathogens in liver transplant recipients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia.
AB  == background: gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus have been a common cause of infection among liver transplant (lt) recipients in recent decades. the understanding of local epidemiology and its evolving trends with regard to pathogenic spectra and antibiotic susceptibility is beneficial to prophylactic and empiric treatment for lt recipients. this study aimed to investigate etiology, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for multidrug resistant (mdr) gram-positive coccal bacteremia after lt. methods: a cohort analysis of prospectively recorded data was performed to investigate etiologies, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for mdr gram-positive coccal bacteremia in 475 lt recipients. results: in 475 lt recipients in the first six months after lt, there were a total of 98 episodes of bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci in 82 (17%) patients. seventy-five (77%) bacteremic episodes occurred in the first post-lt month. the most frequent gram-positive cocci were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus  (cons, 46 isolates), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 13) and enterococcus (34, e. faecium 30, e. faecalis 4). in all gram-positive bacteremic  isolates, 59 of 98 (60%) were mdr. gram-positive coccal bacteremia and mdr gram-positive coccal bacteremia predominantly occurred in patients with acute severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis b and with fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis. four independent risk factors for development of bacteremia caused by  mdr gram-positive coccus were: lt candidates with encephalopathy grades ii - iv (p = 0.013, or: 16.253, 95%ci: 1.822 - 144.995), pre-lt use of empirical antibiotics (p = 0.018, or: 1.029, 95%ci: 1.002 - 1.057), post-lt urinary tract infections (p < 0.001, or: 20.340, 95%ci: 4.135 - 100.048) and abdominal infection (p = 0.004, or: 2.820, 95%ci: 1.122 - 10.114). the main infectious manifestations were coinfections due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. conclusions: methicillin-resistant cons and enterococci are predominant  pathogens among lt recipients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia. occurrences of gram-positive coccal bacteremia may be associated with the severity of illness in the perioperative stage.

TI  == ccrabent serine recombinase genes are widely distributed in the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus casseliflavus species groups and are expressed in e. faecium.
AB  == the presence, distribution and expression of cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes, which are homologous to the staphylococcal ccrab genes and are designated ccrab(ent) genes, were examined in enterococcal isolates (n=421) representing 13 different species. a total of 118 (28 %) isolates were positive for ccrab(ent) genes by pcr, and a number of these were confirmed by southern hybridization with a ccra(ent) probe (n=76) and partial dna sequencing of ccra(ent) and ccrb(ent) genes (n=38). ccrab(ent) genes were present in enterococcus faecium (58/216, 27 %), enterococcus durans (31/38, 82 %), enterococcus hirae (27/52, 50 %), enterococcus casseliflavus (1/4, 25 %) and enterococcus gallinarum (1/2, 50 %). in the eight other species tested, including enterococcus faecalis (n=94), ccrab(ent) genes were not found. thirty-eight sequenced ccrab(ent) genes from five different enterococcal species showed 94-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and linkage pcrs showed heterogeneity in the ccrab(ent) flanking chromosomal genes. expression analysis of ccrab(ent) genes from the e. faecium do strain showed constitutive expression as a bicistronic mrna. the ccrab(ent) mrna levels were lower during log phase than stationary phase in relation to total mrna. multilocus sequence typing was performed on 39 isolates. ccrab(ent) genes were detected in both hospital-related (10/29, 34 %) and non-hospital (4/10, 40 %) strains of e. faecium. various sequence types were  represented by both ccrab(ent) positive and negative isolates, suggesting acquisition or loss of ccrab(ent) in e. faecium. in summary, ccrab(ent) genes, potentially involved in genome plasticity, are expressed in e. faecium and are widely distributed in the e. faecium and e. casseliflavus species groups.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) based on activated sludge system. the number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. among enterococci the predominant species were enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to enterococcus hirae (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and enterococcus durans (0.5%). resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. most frequently, among escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. in the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. nevertheless their number in the wwtp effluent was higher than 10(4) cfu per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. the positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (mar). in treated wastewater mar e. coli  and mar enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.

TI  == clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium bacteraemia in cancer patients.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the risk factors, clinical features and outcomes in cancer patients with bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. a retrospective, observational 7-year study was carried out in a 450-bed, acute-care university-affiliated hospital. we performed univariate comparisons between the two groups and then multivariate analysis to identify patient risk factors for e. faecium isolation. seventy-three patients were included in the analysis: 54 (74.0%) with bacteraemia caused by e. faecalis and 19 (26.0%) by e. faecium. the  simplified acute physiological score (saps) value was significantly greater in e. faecium isolates (40.7 vs. 35.2; p = 0.009). diabetes mellitus was more frequently diagnosed in patients with e. faecium bacteraemia (52.6% vs. 24.1%; p  = 0.021). prior penicillin exposure was more frequent in patients with e. faecium bacteraemia (68.4% vs. 29.6%; p = 0.003). there was a trend toward higher mortality in e. faecium bacteraemia patients (47.4% vs. 25.9%; p = 0.084). independent patient risk factors for e. faecium isolation were prior penicillin exposure (odds ratio [or], 6.479; p = 0.003) and saps > 34 (or, 6.896; p = 0.009). when compared to e. faecalis bacteraemia, e. faecium bacteraemia in cancer patients is independently associated with more severe illness and prior use of penicillins; therefore, empiric treatment which would cover e. faecium should be considered in cancer patients suspected of having bacteraemia.

TI  == the importance of sediment and submerged aquatic vegetation as potential habitats for persistent strains of enterococci in a subtropical watershed.
AB  == recent evidence of extended survival of fecal indicator bacteria in sediments and submerged aquatic vegetation (sav) has raised concerns about using indicator bacteria to reliably detect fecal contamination. we monitored enterococci densities and population structure in water, sediment and sav simultaneously at sites across a subtropical watershed (tampa bay, fl, usa) over one year to determine the extent to which each matrix serves as a potential reservoir of enterococci. sav harbored significantly higher mean densities of enterococci than sediments, which harbored higher densities than water. mean enterococci densities were also greater at sites located further upstream in the watershed. the population structure assessed by box-pcr genotyping was relatively dissimilar in  each sample, although some similarities among samples suggested grouping by location. strain diversity ranged from very high to negligible, with lowest overall diversity in lake samples taken during the summer. several strains were highly abundant and cosmopolitan (found across sites, seasons, and matrices) and  were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as the enterococcus species casseliflavus, faecalis, faecium, hirae, and mundtii. the proportional dominance  of certain strains suggests the existence of persistent and possibly naturalized  indicator bacteria populations that are not directly related to pollution events.

TI  == dissemination of an enterococcus inc18-like vana plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == of the 9 vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in michigan. in 5 of the 7 michigan vrsa cases, an  inc18-like vana plasmid was identified in the vrsa isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolate from the same patient. this plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of vrsa. we studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 vre isolates from three separate collections by pcr for plasmid-specific genes traa, repr, and vana. isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures  collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. all vre isolates from 2 michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 vre isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. fifteen vre isolates (3.9%) from michigan were positive for an inc18-like vana plasmid (9 e. faecalis [12.5%], 3 e. faecium [1.0%], 2 e. avium, and 1 e. raffinosus). six vre isolates (0.6%) from outside michigan were positive (3 e. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 e. faecium [0.4%]). of all e.  faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for e. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from michigan had the same tn1546 insertion site location as the vrsa-associated inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside michigan differed in this characteristic. most plasmid-positive e. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by pfge, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. although vre isolates with the vrsa-associated inc18-like vana  plasmid were more common in michigan, they remain rare. periodic surveillance of  vre isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of vrsa.

TI  == enterococcus species composition determined by capillary electrophoresis of the groesl gene spacer region dna.
AB  == marine recreational beaches are monitored for fecal contamination by enterococcus spp. (ent) counts. although different ent species in the environment tend to thrive in and originate from distinct hosts, the current monitoring method does not differentiate among species. time-consuming isolation-based species identification precludes routine analysis of environmental ent communities. therefore, an isolation-independent dna fingerprinting method was developed to characterize environmental ent communities using dna length polymorphism of the spacer region between the groes and groel genes common to most ent species. capillary electrophoresis resulted in distinct peak sizes of pcr products that carried polymorphic groesl spacers (300-335 bp in length) among 8 different ent species (enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and enterococcus faecalis). distortions in true species ratios observed in electropherograms were caused by pcr biases arising in a mixed ent community dna template. e. faecalis was overestimated and e. avium and e. faecium were underestimated compared to the original species ratios in the mixed community. the pcr product bias was constant between species, so good approximation of the species ratio in ent communities is possible. in environmental samples, a high percentage of e. faecalis (96%) together with high total ent counts were observed in samples collected from a sewer line and from several sites in a storm drain system where sewage leaks were suspected. in contrast, samples with <400 cfu 100  ml-1 ent were either dominated by e. mundtii or had 4 or more ent species. the latter ent community profiles are considered to be signatures of enterococci rarely associated with animals with low or of non-fecal origin.

AB  == background: inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria may be involved in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd, e.g. crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc)) and variations in the host genome may mediate this process. il-10 gene-deficient (il10-/-) mice develop cd-like colitis mainly in the colon, in part due to inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria including enterococcus strains, and have therefore been used as an animal model of cd. comprehensive characterization of changes in cecum gene expression levels  associated with inflammation in the il10-/- mouse model has recently been reported. our aim was to characterize changes in colonic gene expression levels in il10-/- and c57bl/6j (c57; control) mice resulting from oral bacterial inoculation with 12 enterococcus faecalis and faecium (ef) strains isolated from  calves or poultry, complex intestinal flora (cif) collected from healthy control  mice, or a mixture of the two (ef.cif). we investigated two hypotheses: (1) that  oral inoculation of il10-/- mice would result in greater and more consistent intestinal inflammation than that observed in il10-/- mice not receiving this inoculation, and (2) that this inflammation would be associated with changes in colon gene expression levels similar to those previously observed in human studies, and these mice would therefore be an appropriate model for human cd. results: at 12 weeks of age, total rna extracted from intact colon was hybridized to agilent 44 k mouse arrays. differentially expressed genes were identified using linear models for microarray analysis (bioconductor), and these genes were  clustered using genespring gx and ingenuity pathways analysis software. intestinal inflammation was increased in il10-/- mice as a result of inoculation, with the strongest effect being in the ef and ef.cif groups. genes differentially expressed in il10-/- mice as a result of ef or ef.cif inoculation were associated with the following pathways: inflammatory disease (111 genes differentially expressed), immune response (209 genes), antigen presentation (11 genes, particularly major histocompatability complex class ii), fatty acid metabolism (30 genes) and detoxification (31 genes). conclusions: our results suggest that colonic inflammation in il10-/- mice inoculated with solutions containing enterococcus strains is associated with gene expression changes similar to those  of human ibd, specifically cd, and that with the ef.cif inoculum in particular this is an appropriate model to investigate food-gene interactions relevant to human cd.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and escherichia coli isolates from european wild rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus).
AB  == a total of 44 escherichia coli and 64 enterococci recovered from 77 intestinal samples of wild european rabbits in portugal were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. resistance in e. coli isolates was observed for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. none of the e. coli isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the bla(tem), aada, aac(3)-ii, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the cata genes were demonstrated in all ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates respectively, and the sul1 and/or sul2 and/or  sul3 genes in 4 of 5 sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistant isolates. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (39 isolates), followed by e. faecium (21 isolates) and e. hirae (4 isolates). more than one-fourth (29.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 20.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 14.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 10.9% were resistant to high-level-kanamycin. lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high-level-gentamicin, -streptomycin. no vancomycin-resistance was detected in the enterococci isolates. resistance genes detected included aac(6')-aph(2''), ant(6)-ia, tet(m) and/or tet(l) in all gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline-resistant isolates respectively. the aph(3')-iiia gene was detected  in 6 of 7 kanamycin-resistant isolates, the erm(b) gene in 11 of 13 erythromycin-resistant isolates and the vat(d) gene in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium isolate. this survey showed that faecal bacteria such as e. coli and enterococci of wild rabbits could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  == aims: to determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (columba livia forma domestica) in the czech republic. methods and results: cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in  the city of brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant e. coli. resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the samples were also cultivated for enterococci. species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr. resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by pcr. e. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(e. coli) =203) isolates. using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) e. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. no esbl-producing e. coli isolates were detected. a total of 143 enterococci were isolated: ent. faecalis (36 isolates), ent. faecium (27), ent. durans (19), ent. hirae (17), ent. mundtii (17), ent. gallinarum (12), ent. casseliflavus (12) and ent. columbae (3). resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. resistances were determined by tetk, tetl, tetm, teto, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-ia, aph(3')-iiia, ermb, pbp5, vana and vanc1 genes. conclusions: antibiotic-resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. significance and impact of the study: feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant e. coli and enterococci.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == biocidal efficacy of copper alloys against pathogenic enterococci involves degradation of genomic and plasmid dnas.
AB  == the increasing incidence of nosocomial infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci is a global concern. enterococcal species are  also difficult to eradicate with existing cleaning regimens; they can survive for long periods on surfaces, thus contributing to cases of reinfection and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains. we have investigated the potential use of copper alloys as bactericidal surfaces. clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were inoculated onto copper alloy  and stainless steel surfaces. samples were assessed for the presence of viable cells by conventional culture, detection of actively respiring cells, and assessment of cell membrane integrity. both species survived for up to several weeks on stainless steel. however, no viable cells were detected on any alloys following exposure for 1 h at an inoculum concentration of <or=10(4) cfu/cm(2). analysis of genomic and plasmid dna from bacterial cells recovered from metal surfaces indicates substantial disintegration of the dna following exposure to copper surfaces that is not evident in cells recovered from stainless steel. the  dna fragmentation is so extensive, and coupled with the rapid cell death which occurs on copper surfaces, that it suggests that mutation is less likely to occur. it is therefore highly unlikely that genetic information can be transferred to receptive organisms recontaminating the same area. a combination of effective cleaning regimens and contact surfaces containing copper could be useful not only to prevent the spread of viable pathogenic enterococci but also to mitigate against the occurrence of potential resistance to copper, biocides, or antibiotics and the spread of genetic determinants of resistance to other species.

TI  == antimicrobial-resistant enterococci in animals and meat: a human health hazard?
AB  == enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis belong to the gastrointestinal flora of humans and animals. although normally regarded harmless commensals, enterococci may cause a range of different infections in humans, including urinary tract infections, sepsis, and endocarditis. the use of avoparcin, gentamicin, and virginiamycin for growth promotion and therapy in food animals has lead to the emergence of vancomycin- and gentamicin-resistant enterococci and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium in animals and meat. this implies  a potential risk for transfer of resistance genes or resistant bacteria from food animals to humans. the genes encoding resistance to vancomycin, gentamicin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin have been found in e. faecium of human and animal origin; meanwhile, certain clones of e. faecium are found more frequently in samples from human patients, while other clones predominate in certain animal species. this may suggest that antimicrobial-resistant e. faecium from animals could be regarded less hazardous to humans; however, due to their excellent ability to acquire and transfer resistance genes, e. faecium of animal origin may act as donors of antimicrobial resistance genes for other more virulent enterococci. for e. faecalis, the situation appears different, as similar clones  of, for example, vancomycin- and gentamicin-resistant e. faecalis have been obtained from animals and from human patients. continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from humans and animals is essential to follow trends and detect emerging resistance.

TI  == mobile genetic elements and their contribution to the emergence of antimicrobial  resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == mobile genetic elements (mges) including plasmids and transposons are pivotal in  the dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. enterococcal mges have also been shown to be able to transfer resistance determinants to more pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus. despite their importance, we have a limited knowledge about the prevalence, distribution and genetic content of specific mges in enterococcal populations. molecular epidemiological studies of enterococcal mges  have been hampered by the lack of standardized molecular typing methods and relevant genome information. this review focuses on recent developments in the detection of mges and their contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant enterococci.

TI  == genome-based insights into the evolution of enterococci.
AB  == it is now 15 years since the first genome of a free-living organism was sequenced. subsequent to this milestone, a veritable avalanche of genome sequence data has revolutionized many aspects of microbiology. in this review, we discuss  recent progress on the genomics of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, which are the two enterococcal species that cause the large majority of  enterococcal infections. we focus on the genome-based analysis of enterococcal diversity and phylogeny. studies based on comparative genome hybridization have shown that both species exhibit considerable inter-strain genomic diversity, which is mainly linked to the variable presence of phages, plasmids, pathogenicity islands and conjugative elements. we also discuss how the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies allows for a comprehensive characterization of the gene repertoire of multiple isolates, which can be used for extremely robust analyses of diversity and population structure.

TI  == enterococcal surface protein contributes to persistence in the host but is not a  target of opsonic and protective antibodies in enterococcus faecium infection.
AB  == enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with multiple intrinsic and acquired resistances to antibiotics. in the past, the majority of infections were caused by enterococcus faecalis; however, an increase in enterococcus faecium clinical isolates has been observed in recent years. the enterococcal surface protein (esp) is expressed on the surface of most e. faecium clinical isolates and has been shown to be involved in biofilm formation. here, e. faecium e1162 and its previously created insertion-deletion mutant of the esp gene, e. faecium  e1162deltaesp, were compared in a mouse bacteraemia model. anti-esp serum was tested for its capacity to mediate opsonophagocytic killing of e1162 in vitro and to protect against e. faecium bacteraemia. the inactivation of esp attenuated e.  faecium virulence with reduced numbers of bacteria recovered from the kidneys in  animals infected with the mutant compared to the wild-type strain (p=0.035). passive immunization with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against the recombinant  n-terminal esp protein did not protect mice against e. faecium bacteraemia (p>0.05). in contrast, mice passively immunized with polyclonal antiserum raised  against lipoteichoic acid (lta) from e. faecalis had lower numbers of e. faecium  e1162 in the blood compared to mice immunized with normal rabbit serum. these results suggest that esp contributes to e. faecium persistence in the host. however, in contrast to lta, esp does not seem to be a target for protective antibodies in e. faecium strain e1162 in mouse bacteraemia.

TI  == occurrence of tcrb, a transferable copper resistance gene, in fecal enterococci of swine.
AB  == high concentration of copper, fed as copper sulfate, is often used to increase growth rates in swine. bacteria exposed to copper may acquire resistance, and in  enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, a plasmid-borne transferable copper resistance (tcrb) gene that confers copper resistance has been reported. our objectives were to determine the occurrence of tcrb in fecal enterococci from weaned piglets fed diets with a normal supplemental level (16.5 ppm) or an elevated supplemental level (125 ppm) of copper and to determine the association  of tcrb with copper, erythromycin, and vancomycin resistance. a total of 323 enterococcal isolates were examined and 15 (4.6%) isolates (14 e. faecium and 1 e. faecalis) were positive for tcrb. fifteen tcrb-positive and 15 randomly chosen tcrb-negative isolates from piglets fed the normal supplemental level of copper were tested for erm(b), tet(m), vana, and vanb genes and susceptibilities to copper, erythromycin, tetracyclines, and vancomycin. all tcrb-positive and -negative isolates contained erm(b) and tet(m), but not vana and vanb. the mean minimum inhibitory concentration of copper for tcrb-positive (21.1 mm) was higher (p < 0.001) compared with tcrb-negative isolates (6.1 mm). all isolates were resistant to erythromycin and tetracyclines and susceptible to vancomycin. the transferability of the tcrb gene from tcrb-positive strains to tcrb-negative strains was demonstrated by conjugation. the potential link between tcrb and antibiotic resistance genes and the propensity of enterococci to transfer tcrb to other strains raises the possibility that copper supplementation may exert selection pressure for antibiotic-resistant enterococci. this study is the first  report on the occurrence of the tcrb gene in enterococci isolated from swine in the united states.

AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == pyrosequencing-based comparative genome analysis of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecium and identification of a large transferable pathogenicity island.
AB  == background: the gram-positive bacterium enterococcus faecium is an important cause of nosocomial infections in immunocompromized patients. results: we present a pyrosequencing-based comparative genome analysis of seven e. faecium strains that were isolated from various sources. in the genomes of clinical isolates several antibiotic resistance genes were identified, including the vana transposon that confers resistance to vancomycin in two strains. a functional comparison between e. faecium and the related opportunistic pathogen e. faecalis  based on differences in the presence of protein families, revealed divergence in  plant carbohydrate metabolic pathways and oxidative stress defense mechanisms. the e. faecium pan-genome was estimated to be essentially unlimited in size, indicating that e. faecium can efficiently acquire and incorporate exogenous dna  in its gene pool. one of the most prominent sources of genomic diversity consists of bacteriophages that have integrated in the genome. the crispr-cas system, which contributes to immunity against bacteriophage infection in prokaryotes, is  not present in the sequenced strains. three sequenced isolates carry the esp gene, which is involved in urinary tract infections and biofilm formation. the esp gene is located on a large pathogenicity island (pai), which is between 64 and 104 kb in size. conjugation experiments showed that the entire esp pai can be transferred horizontally and inserts in a site-specific manner. conclusions: genes involved in environmental persistence, colonization and virulence can easily be aquired by e. faecium. this will make the development of successful treatment strategies targeted against this organism a challenge for years to come.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis  and enterococcus faecium in greece between 2002 and 2007.
AB  == we analysed trends in antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus faecalis (n=1498)  and e. faecium (n=625) recovered from clinical infections during 2002-2007 in a greek tertiary care hospital. molecular assays were used to confirm speciation and genotype of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the incidence of infections per 1000 admissions caused by e. faecalis and e. faecium increased during the study period (chi(2) for trend=25.5 and 13.3, respectively; p<0.0001). resistance to ampicillin, high level gentamicin and streptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was found in e. faecalis/e. faecium at rates of 1.3/82.4%, 45.6/51.2%, 48.9/69.1%, 0.5/9.6%, 0.1/8.2% and 0.3/1.6%, respectively. the vana gene was identified in 79.1% of the vre isolates, with vanb found in the remaining 20.1%. analysis of antimicrobial resistance trends showed consistently  high rates of ampicillin resistance among e. faecium isolates. for both enterococcal species, high level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were noted to have increased significantly (p<0.0001). regardless of these alarming trends, strains exhibiting resistance to oxazolidinones seem to be only sporadic  in our region and a trend toward increasing resistance rates to glycopeptides was not detected.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == enhancement of vancomycin activity by phenothiazines against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial and resistance-reversal activities of seven phenothiazine derivatives were evaluated against vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, vancomycin resistant e. faecalis atcc 51299 and ten vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains originating from human infections. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the compounds were determined by agar  dilution method, and synergy between phenothiazines and vancomycin was investigated using checkerboard (microbroth dilution) technique. we found that all enterococci strains, regardless of their susceptibility to vancomycin, were inhibited by phenothiazines at concentrations varying from 8 to 256 microg/ml, with thiethylperazine being the most potent inhibitory agent. besides, all the phenothiazines showed partial synergy with vancomycin and could lessen mic of vancomycin from 512 to 8 microg/ml at their sub-inhibitory concentrations. the highest reduction in mic was observed with chlorpromazine (32 times); however, thiethylperazine and promethazine stood next (24 times). although resistance modification was observed at concentrations higher than those that phenothiazines reach in vivo, the potential offered by non-antibiotics justify further animal experiments as well as clinical trials to establish their clinical relevance.

TI  == genome-based insights into the evolution of enterococci.
AB  == abstract it is now 15 years since the first genome of a free-living organism was  sequenced. since this milestone, a veritable avalanche of genome sequence data has revolutionized many aspects of microbiology. in this review we will discuss recent progress on the genomics of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, which are the two enterococcal species that cause the large majority of enterococcal infections. we will focus on the genome-based analysis of enterococcal diversity  and phylogeny. studies based on comparative genome hybridization showed that both species exhibit considerable inter-strain genomic diversity, which is mainly linked to the variable presence of phages, plasmids, pathogenicity islands and conjugative elements. we will also discuss how the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies allows for a comprehensive characterization of the gene repertoire of multiple isolates, which can be used for extremely robust analyses  of diversity and population structure.

TI  == sewage sludge and liquid pig manure as possible sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
AB  == within the last decades, the environmental spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has become a topic of concern. in this study, liquid pig manure (n=305)  and sewage sludge (n=111) - used as agricultural fertilizers between 2002 and 2005 - were investigated for the presence of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. bacteria were tested for their resistance against 40 chemotherapeutics including several "reserve drugs". e. coli (n=613) from pig manure were at a significantly higher degree resistant to streptomycin,  doxycycline, spectinomycin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol than e. coli (n=116) from sewage sludge. enterococci (ent. faecalis, n=387, and ent. faecium,  n=183) from pig manure were significantly more often resistant to high levels of  doxycycline, rifampicin, erythromycin, and streptomycin than ent. faecalis (n=44) and ent. faecium (n=125) from sewage sludge. significant differences in enterococcal resistance were also seen for tylosin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin high level, fosfomycin, clindamicin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin,  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. by contrast, aminopenicillins were more effective  in enterococci from pig manure, and mean mic-values of piperacillin+tazobactam and third generation cefalosporines were significantly lower in e. coli from pig  manure than in e. coli from sewage sludge. 13.4% (e. coli) to 25.3% (ent. faecium) of pig manure isolates were high-level multiresistant to substances from more than three different classes of antimicrobial agents. in sewage sludge, high-level-multiresistance reached from 0% (ent. faecalis) to 16% (ent. faecium). high rates of (multi-) resistant bacteria in pig manure emphasize the need for a  prudent - cautious - use of antibiotics in farm animals.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium: a prospective, multicenter study in south american hospitals.
AB  == enterococcus faecium has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide, and this trend has been associated with the dissemination of a genetic lineage designated clonal cluster 17 (cc17). enterococcal isolates were collected prospectively (2006 to 2008) from 32 hospitals in colombia, ecuador, peru, and venezuela and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. genotyping was performed with all vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vrefm) isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing. all vrefm isolates were evaluated for the presence of 16 putative virulence genes (14 fms genes, the esp gene of e. faecium [espefm], and the hyl gene of e. faecium [hylefm]) and plasmids carrying the fms20-fms21 (pila), hylefm, and vana genes. of 723 enterococcal isolates recovered, e. faecalis was the most common (78%). vancomycin resistance was detected in 6% of the isolates (74% of which were e. faecium). eleven distinct pfge types were found among the vrefm isolates, with most belonging to sequence types 412 and 18. the ebpaefm-ebpbefm-ebpcefm (pilb) and fms11-fms19-fms16 clusters were detected in all vrefm isolates from the region, whereas espefm and hylefm were detected in 69% and 23% of the isolates, respectively. the fms20-fms21 (pila) cluster, which encodes a putative pilus-like protein, was found on plasmids from almost all vrefm isolates and was sometimes found to coexist with hylefm and the vana gene cluster. the population genetics of vrefm in south america appear to resemble those of such strains in the united  states in the early years of the cc17 epidemic. the overwhelming presence of plasmids encoding putative virulence factors and vana genes suggests that e. faecium from the cc17 genogroup may disseminate in the region in the coming years.

TI  == a new multiplex pcr assay for the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistant  enterococci from rectal swabs.
AB  == objectives: this study describes the diagnostic performance of a recently available multiplex pcr-based kit for the simultaneous detection and identification of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, vana, vanb, vanc1  and vanc2/c3 genes, directly from rectal swabs constituting the most complete existing molecular assay currently available. methods: the diagnostic performance of this assay was evaluated by a multicenter study involving three independent public hospitals and consisted in the analysis of 187 rectal swabs from patients  at high risk for vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization. results: when bacteria culture was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicted values for the assay were 96.8%, 76.0%, 67.7% and 97.9%, respectively. when a composite reference standard consisting of culture and dna sequencing of pcr products was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicted values for the pcr-based assay were 97.8%, 96.9%, 96.7% and 97.9%, respectively. conclusions: based on these results, we conclude that this assay is considerably more sensitive than traditional microbiological methods for detecting vancomycin-resistant enterococci from rectal swabs. it is also much faster than culture. we believe that the implementation of this assay in routine clinical laboratories could help to reduce hospital-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections.

TI  == in vitro prevention of the emergence of daptomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus and enterococci following combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or  ampicillin.
AB  == daptomycin is bactericidal against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate-resistant s. aureus (gisa) and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. however, selection for daptomycin-resistant derivatives has occasionally been reported during therapy in humans. here we evaluate whether selection for daptomycin-resistant s. aureus or  enterococci could be prevented in vitro by combining daptomycin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin or rifampicin. six strains of s. aureus (four mrsa and two gisa) and four strains of enterococci (two enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium) were serially exposed in broth to two-fold stepwise increasing concentrations of daptomycin alone or in combination with a fixed concentration [0.25x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)] of either of the second agents. the daptomycin mic was examined after each cycle. exposure to daptomycin alone gradually selected for s. aureus and enterococci with an increased mic. gentamicin did not prevent the emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacteria. rifampicin was also unable to prevent daptomycin resistance, although resistance was slightly delayed. in contrast, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin prevented or greatly delayed the selection of daptomycin-resistant mutants in s. aureus and enterococci, respectively. addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin to daptomycin prevents, or greatly delays, daptomycin resistance in vitro. future studies in animal models are needed to predict the utility of these combinations in humans.

TI  == bacteriocinogenic potential of newly isolated strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from dairy products of pakistan.
AB  == present study was carried for the isolation of bacteriocin producing enterococci  from indigenous sources. gram positive enterococci are known for having the ability to produce enterocins with good antimicrobial potential. a total of 34 strains were isolated from processed dairy products of pakistan and seven out of  them were found to be member of genus enterococci on selective enumeration. biochemical and molecular characterization revealed that four of these isolates (ij-03, ij-07, ij-11 and ij-12) were enterococcus faecalis while three (ij-06, ij-21 and ij-31) were enterococcus faecium. local processed cheese was the source of all enterococcal isolates, except e. faecium ij-21 and ij-31 which were isolated from indigenous yoghurt and butter samples respectively. bacterial isolates were sensitive to commonly used antibiotics except methicillin and kanamycin. they also lack critical virulence determinants mainly cytolysin (cyl), gelatinase (gel), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and vancomycin resistance (vana and vanb). polymerase chain reaction amplification identified that enterocin a and p genes were present in the genome of e. faecium ij-06 and ij-21  while e. faecium ij-31 genome showed only enterocin p genes. no amplification was observed for genes that corresponded with the enterocins 31, as-48, l50a, l50b and ent 1071a and 1071 b. also there were no signals of amplification found for e. faecalis ij-11 indicating that the antimicrobial activity was because of an enterocin different from those checked by pcr. so the indigenous bacterial isolates have great potential for bacteriocin production and they had antibacterial activity against a variety of closely related species.

TI  == [evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == evidence for the clustering of antibacterial resistance phenotypes of enterococci within integrated poultry companies.
AB  == from july to december 2006, a panel of 401 enterococci was isolated from carcass  rinse samples collected in five poultry processing plants in new zealand. agar diffusion assays for nine antibacterial drugs were used to obtain a resistance phenotype for each isolate. hierarchical clustering techniques and diversity indices showed a high diversity of resistance phenotypes within each plant, with  populations of enterococcus faecalis showing greater heterogeneity than enterococcus faecium. bayesian modelling identified three clusters of phenotype patterns within the panel: the e. faecium isolates showed a high probability of containing two distinct clusters, whilst the e. faecalis isolates all grouped together to form the third cluster. the validity of these three clusters was examined using pairwise fixation indices and analysis of variance. comparing the  three clusters to the structure of the participating companies showed that resistance phenotypes for e. faecium isolated from processing plants that were geographically separated but were operated by the same integrated poultry company were more similar than e. faecium isolated from unconnected companies. company-level management factors, such as the routine use of antibacterial drugs  and the genetic line of birds reared, mirrored the structure of these clusters, thus indicating that company-level factors were the dominant selective pressures  upon resistance phenotypes across all operating units within these integrated poultry companies.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
AB  == the effects of nine probiotic strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were examined. the culture supernatant of the e. faecium strain, with or without ph adjustment to a neutral  ph, had a strong bactericidal effect on eaggec, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. supernatants of the l. casei ss. casei and l. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on eaggec, but this activity was abolished by ph adjustment to a neutral ph. no inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of bifidobacterium or e. faecalis strains was detected. adhesion of  eaggec to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains  tested. two strains of l. casei enhanced eaggec biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. these results suggest that the three different bacterial species; lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus, have different effects on eaggec, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against eaggec infection.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of various species of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 105 enterococci isolates were examined: enterococcus faecalis (n = 47), enterococcus  faecium (n = 39), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 6), enterococcus avium (n = 6), enterococcus hirae (n = 5) and enterococcus durans (n = 2). all the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, and only a single e. hirae  isolate was resistant to ampicillin. in general, the most frequently observed resistance among the enterococcal isolates was to tetracycline (69.5%), followed  by penicillin (64.7%), erythromycin (57.1%) and cephalothin (44.7%). a similar antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed among individual species except e.  durans, which exhibited only tetracycline resistance. resistance observed among isolates of e. hirae and e. gallinarum was almost as high as e. faecium and e. faecalis. of 105 isolates, only six (5.7%) strains of e. faecium were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested and about 52% (55/105) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobials. the most common multiple resistance pattern was penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, which was observed in 32 of 105 (30.4%) isolates. this study demonstrates that enterococcal isolates belonging to minor species showed antimicrobial resistance rates as high as those of e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance should not be restricted only to those two major species.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp.: validation of susceptibility testing and  in vitro activity of vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged to become a significant nosocomial pathogen. however, detection may be challenging and treatment possibilities are limited. reports of resistance to linezolide, daptomycin and tigecycline underline the need for reliable susceptibility testing with respect to these compounds. we evaluated the in vitro activity of vancomycin, linezolid,  daptomycin and tigecycline against a panel of vre and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci by broth microdilution (bmd). etest for determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of these four antibiotics and two disc diffusion assays  for detecting vre and for susceptibility testing against tigecycline and linezolid were evaluated. before susceptibility testing, all isolates were classified by polymerase chain reaction as vana or vanb gene positive or vana/b gene negative. linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline had excellent in vitro activity towards all isolates. for daptomycin and tigecycline, the overall agreement between bmd and etest was suboptimal. for both disc diffusion assays, use of current break points was inadequate to detect vancomycin resistance for isolates carrying the vanb gene. inspection of the inhibition zone for a diffuse  edge, as recommended, accurately predicted presence of the vanb gene.

TI  == diagnostic microarray for human and animal bacterial diseases and their virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes.
AB  == rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease is often based on the identification and characterization of causative agents derived from phenotypic characteristics. current methods can be laborious and time-consuming, often requiring many skilled personnel and a large amount of lab space. the objective of our study was to develop a spotted microarray for rapid identification and characterization of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance genes. our spotted microarray consists of 489 70mer probes that detect 40 bacterial pathogens of medical, veterinary and zoonotic importance (including 15 niaid category a, b and c pathogens); associated genes that encode resistance for antimicrobial and metal resistance; and dna elements that are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. high specificity and reliability of the microarray was achieved for bacterial pathogens of animal and human importance by validating mdr pathogenic bacteria as pure cultures or by following their inoculation in complex and highly organic sample matrices, such as soil and manure.

TI  == risk factors and management of gram-positive bacteraemia.
AB  == the incidence of gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. the virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of s. aureus bloodstream infections. the rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant s. aureus  carrying the panton-valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) creep gives cause for concern, and mics >1 microg/ml are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with s. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for s. aureus bloodstream infections in settings  with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections. enterococci are the third leading cause of gram-positive bacteraemia  in our institution. management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in enterococcus faecium infections. the recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused  by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

AB  == most of the bacteriophages (phages) currently reported in enterococcus spp. belong to tailed families of bacteriophages podoviridae, siphoviridae, and myoviridae. there is a little information on non-tailed bacteriophages isolated from enterococci. samples of sewage and piggery effluents were tested on pig and  chicken isolates of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and e. gallinarum for lytic phages. in addition, isolates were exposed to mitomycin c to induce lysogenic phages. bacteriophages that were detected were visualized by electron microscopy. ten bacteriophages were of isometric shape with long flexible or non-flexible tails, while one had a long head with a long flexible tail; all contained double-stranded dna molecules. seven polyhedral, filamentous, and pleomorphic-shaped phages containing dna or rna were also observed. the pleomorphic phages were droplet- or lemon-shaped in morphology. this study is the first report on polyhedral phages in enterococcus spp. of animal origin and also  the first report of filamentous and pleomorphic phages in enterococci.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) cross-transmission between two patient groups (long-term dialysis and kidney transplant patients). molecular typing, by  automated ribotyping with the riboprinter microbial characterization system (qualicon, usa), was used to analyze vre isolates from 31 fecal samples of 320 dialysis patients and 38 fecal samples of 280 kidney transplant patients. clonal  spread of e. faecalis and e. casseliflavus was observed intragroup, but not between the two groups of patients. in turn, transmission of e. gallinarum and e. faecium between the groups was suggested by the finding of vancomycin-resistant isolates belonging to the same ribogroup in both dialysis and transplant patients. the fact that these patients were colonized by vre from the same ribogroup in the same health care facility provides evidence for cross-transmission and supports the adoption of stringent infection control measures to prevent dissemination of these bacteria.

TI  == modelling conjugation with stochastic differential equations.
AB  == conjugation is an important mechanism involved in the transfer of resistance between bacteria. in this article a stochastic differential equation based model  consisting of a continuous time state equation and a discrete time measurement equation is introduced to model growth and conjugation of two enterococcus faecium strains in a rich exhaustible media. the model contains a new expression  for a substrate dependent conjugation rate. a maximum likelihood based method is  used to estimate the model parameters. different models including different noise structure for the system and observations are compared using a likelihood-ratio test and akaike's information criterion. experiments indicating conjugation on the agar plates selecting for transconjugants motivates the introduction of an extended model, for which conjugation on the agar plate is described in the measurement equation. this model is compared to the model without plate conjugation. the modelling approach described in this article can be applied generally when modelling dynamical systems.

TI  == zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus spp. recovered from a commercial beef processing plant. samples were obtained from conveyers used for moving carcasses before the start of operation (cc), 2 h after operation has started (dc), and from ground beef (gb). randomly selected isolates from each positive sample (13 from cc; 28 from dc; 26 from gb)  were confirmed to genus and species levels using pcr and the api 20 strep kit (biomerieux canada, inc., st. laurent, canada). a total of 199 isolates comprising 39, 84, and 76 from cc, dc, and gb, respectively, were used for antimicrobial resistance testing, major resistance genes detection, and genetic analysis. enterococcus faecalis (87%) was the most common species found followed  by enterococcus faecium (10%). the majority of enterococci were highly associated with dc samples. about 42% of e. faecium from dc samples were resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. resistance to lincomycin was observed in >90% of e. faecalis from all the three sample sources. the tetracycline-resistant enterococci (52%) were significantly higher in dc samples. intermediate resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in enterococci from cc and dc samples. the tetracycline and quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance in enterococci was highly correlated with the presence of tet(m) and vat(e) genes. the erm(b) gene was found in about 50% of the e. faecium isolates from gb samples and was also present in >12% of the e. faecalis isolates from all the three sample sources. enterococci from individual sample sources were genetically similar. a number of e. faecalis from cc, dc, and gb were clustered together at >85% similarity level. these findings suggest that antimicrobial-resistant enterococcus spp. are prevalent during commercial beef processing and can transfer between various locations in the plant and that a pool of resistance genes can be found in these enterococci.

TI  == impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic  prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic  use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention.  this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr  and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.

TI  == species distribution and resistance patterns to growth-promoting antimicrobials of enterococci isolated from pigs and chickens in korea.
AB  == a total of 147 enterococcus faecium and 165 enterococcus faecalis isolates from fecal samples of chickens and pigs at slaughterhouses in korea were tested for their resistance to 8 growth-promoting antimicrobials commonly used in animals and quinupristin and dalfopristin. resistance to most antimicrobials was very common among both e. faecalis and e. faecium. in particular, e. faecalis showed almost no susceptibility to all the antimicrobials tested except penicillin and flavomycin, to which 1.4% and less than 24% showed resistance, respectively. although the prevalence of resistance was lower than in e. faecalis, e. faecium showed relatively uniform resistance to all the agents tested. among the antimicrobials tested, virginiamycin and penicillin were the most effective against e. faecium isolates: less than 31% and 41% showed resistance to those 2 antimicrobials, respectively. penicillin was the only agent that showed relatively strong activity against both e. faecalis and e. faecium. resistance observed in e. faecalis and e. faecium against most antimicrobials used for growth promotion was more prevalent in korea than in european countries. the current study is the first report of resistance against feed additive antimicrobials in enterococcal isolates from livestock in korea.

TI  == genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from african traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  == aim: to identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) leaves, roselle (hibiscus sabdariffa) and african locust bean (parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, ntoba mbodi, bikalga and soumbala. methods and results: a total of  121 lab were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its-pcr),  repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) and dna sequencing. the results revealed  a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of lab in african alkaline fermentations. the isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. its-pcr allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. rep-pcr permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. dna sequencing combined with use of api 50chl and api 20strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus hirae from ntoba mbodi; ent. faecium, ent. hirae and pediococcus acidilactici from bikalga and soumbala. conclusion: lab found in african alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. significance and impact of the study: our study confirms that lab survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.

TI  == c-reactive protein and interleukin-6 responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiology in late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == fungal infections are increasingly frequent causes of neonatal sepsis (ns). this  study examined the predictive value of the combined evaluation of the c-reactive  protein (crp) and interleukin-6 (il-6) responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiologies in patients with ns. from january to september 2007, neonates who were diagnosed with ns and had their crp and il-6 levels measured were selected. based on their blood culture results, the neonates were divided into two groups: group of fungal sepsis (fs) and group of bacterial sepsis (bs).  fs included 14 candida albicans and one non-albicans candida isolates and bs included five klebsiella pneumoniae, three pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterococcus faecalis, two coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, one enterococcus faecium and one acinetobacter species. significant differences were  observed in the crp (fs vs. bs: 28.10 +/- 11.03 vs. 11.39 +/- 2.94 mg l(-1), p =  0.026) and il-6 (fs vs. bs: 38.60 +/- 24.24 vs. 392.82 +/- 102.46 ng l(-1), p = 0.000) levels between groups. the combined evaluation of the crp and il-6 responses better predicted the causative micro-organism in ns.

TI  == national monitoring for antimicrobial resistance among indicator bacteria isolated from food-producing animals in japan.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 2,205 isolates of escherichia coli and 1,181 isolates of enterococcus faecalis (n=610) and e. faecium (n=571) from apparently healthy cattle, pigs and broiler and layer chickens collected from 2000 to 2003 were examined using an agar dilution method. overall, the isolates from cattle and layer chickens showed a lower incidence of resistance to almost all antimicrobials studied compared with those from pigs and broiler chickens. fluoroquinolone resistance was found at a low level in isolates of e. coli from four animal species and in e. faecalis from pigs and broiler and layer chickens.  resistance to cephalosporin was identified in isolates of e. coli from broiler chickens in 2000-2002 and from four animal species in 2003. incidence of antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria did not vary from year to year during the investigation period.

TI  == a classification system for plasmids from enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a classification system for plasmids isolated from enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria was developed based on 111 published plasmid sequences from enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria; mostly staphylococci. based on pcr amplification of conserved areas of the replication initiating genes (rep), alignment of these sequences and using a cutoff value of 80% identity on both protein and dna level, 19 replicon families (rep-families) were defined together  with several unique sequences. the prevalence of these rep-families was tested on 79 enterococcal isolates from a collection of isolates of animal and human origin. difference in prevalence of the designed rep-families were detected with  rep(9) being most prevalent in enterococcus faecalis and rep(2) in enterococcus faecium. in 33% of the tested e. faecium and 32% of the tested e. faecalis no positive amplicons were detected. furthermore, conjugation experiments were performed obtaining 30 transconjugants when selecting for antimicrobial resistance. among them 19 gave no positive amplicons indicating presence of rep-families not tested for in this experimental setup.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a newly isolated lytic bacteriophage, efap-1 of enterococcus faecalis, and antibacterial activity of its endolysin efal-1.
AB  == aims: in this work, we aimed to identify an effective treatment of infections caused by enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. methods and results: we report the isolation and characterization of a new lytic  bacteriophage, designated bacteriophage efap-1, that is capable of lysing enterococcus faecalis bacteria that exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. efap-1 has low sequence similarity to all known bacteriophages. transmission electron microscopy confirmed that efap-1 belongs to the siphoviridae family. a putative lytic protein of efap-1, endolysin efal-1, is encoded in orf 2 and was expressed in escherichia coli. recombinant efal-1 had broad-spectrum lytic activity against several gram-positive pathogens, including ent. faecalis and enterococcus faecium. conclusions: the complete genome sequence of the newly isolated enterococcal lytic phage was analysed, and it was demonstrated that its  recombinant endolysin had broad lytic activity against various gram-positive pathogens. significance and impact of the study: bacteriophage efap-1 and its lytic protein, efal-1, can be utilized as potent antimicrobial agents against enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics in hospital infections and also as environmental disinfectants to control disease-causing enterococcus spp. in dairy farms.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [differentiating clinical characteristics in bacteriemia caused by enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium].
AB  == introduction: enterococci are responsible for severe infections, such as endocarditis and bacteremia. during recent decades, enterococcal infections have  grown in importance because of the increasing number of cases. knowledge of the factors predisposing to acquisition of infection by e. faecalis or e. faecium may be useful to improve the empirical treatment. methods: retrospective study of patients diagnosed with enterococcal bacteremia and hospitalized over a 7-year period (january 2000-december 2006), analyzing demographic data, clinical and microbiological characteristics, antibiotic exposure, treatment, and outcome. to  identify the predisposing factors for isolation of e. faecalis or e. faecium in a clinical specimen, we performed univariate comparisons between the 2 groups, and  subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis. results: a total of 228  episodes of bacteremia were recorded, 168 caused by e. faecalis and 60 by e. faecium. all e. faecalis isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, but only 25% of e. faecium were ampicillin-susceptible. there was only 1 vancomycin-resistant isolate. the variables independently associated with acquisition of e. faecium bacteriemia were surgical ward admission (odds ratio [or], 4.223; p=.001), >5 days of previous treatment with cephalosporins (or, 2.564; p=.013), >5 days of carbapenems (or, 2.652; p=.027), previous administration of penicillins (or, 2.008; p=0.044), saps score >30 at admission (or, 3.530; p=0.001), and hepatobiliary disease as a comorbid condition (or, 3.754; p<0.001), conclusion: because of the differing susceptibility patterns of the enterococcal species studied, it is essential to know the factors predisposing to acquisition of infection by one or the other species to initiate adequate empirical treatment.

TI  == influence of oral hygiene in patients with fixed appliances in the oral carriage  of antimicrobial-resistant escherichia coli and enterococcus isolates.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to study the oral carriage of enterococcus and escherichia coli isolates and their content in antimicrobial-resistance and virulence genes in patients with fixed appliances and in healthy volunteers. study design: samples from supragingival plaques/tooth surfaces/fixed orthodontic appliances were taken in patients with fixed appliances (n = 46) and in healthy volunteers (n = 55). samples were seeded on specific media for enterococcal and e. coli recovery, and 1 isolate of each type per sample was selected. antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, bacteriocins, and virulence factors were checked by polymerase chain  reaction. results: enterococci or e. coli were not recovered from healthy volunteers. nevertheless, 10 isolates (5 e. faecium, 3 e. faecalis, and 2 e. coli) were obtained from 19.5% of patients with fixed appliances, and poor oral hygiene was evidenced in all of the these patients. percentages of antimicrobial  resistance and the resistance genes detected among the enterococci were: erythromycin: 100%, erm(b); kanamycin: 75%, aph(3')-iiia; tetracycline: 50%, tet(l) with/without tet(m); streptomycin: 37%, ant(6)-ia; chloramphenicol: 12%, cata. one e. coli isolate showed a phenotype of multiresistance containing 5 resistance genes and class 1 and 2 integrons. all enterococci produced gelatinase, and 4 isolates contained genes encoding enterocins l50a/b and p. the  esp virulence gene was found in 1 multiresistant e. faecalis isolate. conclusions: poor or improper oral hygiene in individuals with fixed appliances favors the oral carriage of antimicrobial-resistant e. coli and enterococci. additional investigations are needed to assess its implication in human health.

AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the population of enterococcus sp. in domestic wastewater as it flows through a constructed wetland. methods and results: four hundred and eighty-four enterococcus isolates  were collected from the inlet, various sites within and from the outlet of a plastic lined constructed wetland in college station, tx. the wetland treated septic tank effluent that passed sequentially through two 1.89 m(3) septic tanks  and a 1.89 m(3) pump tank allowing 48 l doses at a 24 l min(-1) rate. the enterococcus isolates were identified to species using the commercial biolog system. the 484 enterococcus isolates were comprised of ten different species, including enterococcus faecalis (30.6%), enterococcus pseudoavium (24.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (12.8%), enterococcus faecium (11.2%), enterococcus mundtii (7.9%), enterococcus gallinarum (6.2%), enterococcus dispar (3.7%), enterococcus hirae (2.1%), enterococcus durans and enterococcus flavescens both 0.8%. of the 88 isolates collected from the inlet, only 9.1% of the isolates were identified as ent. faecalis and ent. pseudoavium (36.4%) was identified as the predominant species. whereas of the 74 isolates collected from the outlet, the predominant species were identified as ent. faecalis (29.7%). species identification varied among sites within the wetland, but often ent. faecalis was the predominant species. conclusions: our data suggest that while ent. faecalis is the predominant species of enterococcus found in domestic wastewater, the populations may shift during treatment as the wastewater flows through the constructed wetland. significance and impact of the study: we found that shifts in enterococcus species composition occurred during domestic wastewater treatment. this has implications for the identification of faecal pollution based on the presence of specific bacterial types associated with domestic wastewater.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and other gram-positive bacteria. data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against mrsa. linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. the investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin  are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. dalbavancin inhibits vanb type vre at low concentrations, but is not active against vana type vre. telavancin is less active against vre than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against vre. with continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.

AB  == from may 2007 to january 2008, 30 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), including 29 enterococcus faecium (96.7%) and 1 e. faecalis (3.3%) were obtained from various clinical specimens of 30 patients treated at a university hospital in taiwan. among these patients, 27 had vre infections, including urinary tract infection (n = 16), bacteremia (n = 5), wound infection (n = 5), and central nervous system infection (n = 1). three patients had vre colonization. all of these isolates belonged to the vana genotype with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations of 64>or=128 microg/ml. the isolate of e. faecalis had vanb phenotype-vana genotype. all these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by tigecycline at 0.25 microg/ml. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) analysis of the e. faecium isolates showed that 82.8% were st78, which belongs to lineage c1. transposon typing classified the 30 isolates of vre into three types and most of the tn1546-like elements contained an is1251-like insertion sequence. mating experiments showed that the vana gene clusters were transferable at a frequency of about 10(-6) to 10(-7). our findings indicate that nosocomial spread of vre resulted from dissemination of lineage c1  e. faecium clones, including a novel e. faecium mlst type (st444), and the horizontal transfer of tn1546 elements among enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from us medical centers: results of the daptomycin surveillance program (2007-2008).
AB  == gram-positive bacterial strains (12 443) consecutively collected during 2007 to 2008 in hospitals located in the united states were tested by reference broth microdilution methods against daptomycin and comparison agents. methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 55.9% and 74.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 5.4% and 75.4%, respectively. daptomycin was very active against all gram-positive species with mic(90) values of 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 microg/ml for staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, respectively. overall, 99.9% of s. aureus, 100.0% of e. faecalis, and 99.5% of e. faecium were susceptible to daptomycin. in addition, daptomycin mic distributions for s. aureus and enterococci from 2007 to 2008 were very similar to those from 2002 to 2003. in summary, high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were observed in us hospitals, but daptomycin remains active against these clinically important gram-positive organisms with no evidence of potency loss since its approval for clinical use in late 2003.

TI  == identification and isolation of an azoreductase from enterococcus faecium.
AB  == azo dyes are commonly used in many commercial industries. some of the azo dyes can produce carcinogenic compounds after being metabolized by azoreductase. several human intestinal microbiota possess azoreductase activity which plays an  important role in the toxicity and mutagenicity of these azo dye compounds. the acpd gene product (azoef1) responsible for the azoreductase activity of enterococcus faecium, an intestinal bacterium, was heterologously expressed, purified and characterized. the protein sequence shares 67% identity with the azoreductase from enterococcus faecalis, azoa. although azoef1 possesses many commonalities with azoa, there are differences in coenzyme preference, residues associated with fmn binding, substrate specificity, and specific activity. azoef1 utilized both nadh and nadph for the reduction of azo dyes, and it contains a leucyl residue at position 104 and threonyl residue at position 19 which differ from azoa at the active site. its specific activity was 5095 m/min/mg and its catalytic efficiency for methyl red reduction was lower than azoa.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == ecology of enterococcus faecalis and niche-adapted or non-niche-adapted enterococcus faecium in continuous-flow anaerobic cultures.
AB  == an anaerobic continuous-flow culture of chicken gastrointestinal microflora (ccf) and pure cultures of enterococcus faecalis i.2 were used for survivability studies of niche-adapted and non-niche-adapted enterococcus faecium isolates. ccf eliminated non-ccf niche-adapted glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium 47 (gre47) at  a rate of 1.01 log(10) cfu/ml/day, whereas ccf niche-adapted e. faecium i.3(rif)  survived in ccf at 4.5-6.5 log(10) cfu/ml. in continuous-flow monocultures of gre47 (8.93 log(10) cfu/ml), the addition of 100 ml (9.5% total volume) of ccf resulted in the displacement of gre47 in 14 days at a rate of 0.66 log(10) cfu/ml/day. pure continuous-flow cocultures were used to assess a direct inhibitory effect of e. faecalis i.2 on e. faecium isolates. in cocultures of e.  faecalis i.2 and gre47, gre47 was eliminated from the culture at a rate of 1.24 log(10) cfu/ml/day. in cocultures of e. faecalis i.2 and e. faecium i.3(rif), the e. faecium i.3(rif) population fluctuated, but was 6.86 log(10) cfu/ml on day 21. a fit subset of the e. faecium i.3(rif) population survived in ccf and with e. faecalis i.2 alone. no subset of the non-niche-adapted e. faecium gre47 was able  to survive under the same conditions. the mechanism by which e. faecium i.3(rif)  is tolerant in ccf, and in e. faecalis coculture is unknown. e. faecium i.3(rif)  and gre47 possessed the cell wall adhesion factor efaafm. e. faecalis i.2 was positive by polymerase chain reaction for gele, efaafs, cad, ccf, cdp, and cob, but not the cytolysin-associated gene cylmab, suggesting that the mechanism of activity against e. faecium strains was due to factors other than the two-component cytolysin.

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == genetic diversity of enterococci harboring the high-level gentamicin resistance gene aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia or aph(2'')-ie in a japanese hospital.
AB  == prevalence of high-level gentamicin resistance genes aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and aph(2'')-ie, which encode distinct aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, was analyzed for a total of 1128 clinical isolates of enterococci obtained in a japanese hospital during a period between 1997 and 2007. the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia was detected in 40.1%, 12.9%, and 3.6% of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and other enterococcal species, respectively, and aph(2'')-ie was detected in 3.3% of e. faecium. during the study period, detection rate of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia in  e. faecium increased from 4% (1997-1998) to 28% (2006-2007), whereas generally constant in e. faecalis. by the analysis of is256-flanking patterns of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia, truncated forms of tn5281 lacking is256 at the 3'-end, 5'-end, and both ends of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia were identified in 4.6%, 32.4%, and 34.2% of e. faecalis strains, respectively, while the composite tn5281-like element with is256 at both sides was detected in 28.7% of the strains. a truncated form of tn5281 lacking is256 at the 5'-end was predominant in other enterococcal species. among 14 e. faecalis and 10 e. faecium strains harboring aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia, 8 and 6 different sequence types (sts) were identified by multilocus sequence typing, respectively. some e. faecalis sts (st4, st16, st64,  and st223) were found in more than one strain, and st4 and st64 were associated with different is256-flanking patterns. sts of five among six e. faecium strains  with aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia (st78, st203, and st418) belonged to the clonal complex (cc)17, which is known as globally emerging lineage of vancomycin- or ampicillin-resistant e. faecium clones. e. faecium strains with aph(2'')-ie were  classified into newly assigned sts, st426, and its single locus variant st427, which also belonged to cc17. therefore, it was suggested that e. faecium of cc17  is prone to acquire high-level gentamicin resistance genes, and aph(2'')-ie is distributed to specific e. faecium clones that are distinct from those having aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia.

TI  == lpxtg surface proteins of enterococci.
AB  == enterococci have become an important cause of nosocomial infections since the late 1980s. several surface proteins have been implicated in contributing to infections caused by enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. understanding the in vivo function of enterococcal surface proteins, particularly their role in directing interactions with the host during infection, is essential to explain the success of enterococci as nosocomial pathogens. here we review current knowledge of enterococcal lpxtg surface proteins, including aggregation substance, enterococcal surface protein, three collagen-binding microbial surface components that recognize adhesive matrix molecules (ace, acm, scm) and pili (ebp, pila and pilb), their interactions with host molecules and their role in pathogenicity and biofilm development.

TI  == virulence of enterococcus faecalis dairy strains in an insect model: the role of  fsrb and gele.
AB  == despite the existence of various virulence factors in the enterococcus genus, enterococcal virulence is still a debated issue. a main consideration is the detection of the same virulence genes in strains isolated from nosocomial or community-acquired infections, and from food products. the goal of this study was to evaluate the roles of two well-characterized enterococcal virulence factors, fsr and gelatinase, in the potential virulence of enterococcus faecalis food strains. virulence of unrelated enterococcus isolates, including dairy strains carrying fsr and gele operons, was compared in the galleria mellonella insect model. e. faecalis dairy strains were able to kill larvae and were as virulent as strain og1rf, one of the most widely used for virulence studies. in contrast, enterococcus durans and enterococcus faecium strains were avirulent or poorly virulent for g. mellonella. to evaluate the role of fsrb and gele in virulence of e. faecalis dairy strains, both genes were deleted independently in two strains.  the delta fsrb and delta gele deletion mutants both produced a gelatinase-negative phenotype. although both mutations significantly attenuated virulence in g. mellonella, the delta fsrb strains were more strongly attenuated. these results agree with previous findings suggesting the involvement of fsrb in  the control of other cell functions relevant to virulence. our work demonstrates  that the presence of functional fsrb, and to a lesser extent gele, in dairy enterococci should be considered with caution.

TI  == vana in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus detected in french cattle.
AB  == the goal of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci species presenting van-mediated glycopeptide resistance in french cattle. fecal samples were collected from healthy and sick animals, and enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance. vancomycin resistance was principally encountered in enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus strains. however, glycopeptide resistance was detected in three different species of enterococci (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus). molecular characterization of the genetic support proved that they all presented the prototypic vana element. interestingly, the e. casseliflavus strain displayed a remarkable vanb phenotype/vana-vanc genotype. transferability, associated resistances, and factors of vana cotransfer were sought. this study proved that acquired vana genes can still be detected in food-producing animals more than a decade after the avoparcin ban. indeed, calves, which are recurrently exposed to antibiotics in france, may allow the re-emergence of glycopeptide resistance through coselection factors, and this might potentially be concerning for human health.

TI  == enterococci in river ganga surface waters: propensity of species distribution, dissemination of antimicrobial-resistance and virulence-markers among species along landscape.
AB  == background: surface waters quality has declined in developing countries due to rapid industrialization and population growth. the microbiological quality of river ganga, a life-sustaining surface water resource for large population of northern india, is adversely affected by several point and non-point sources of pollution. further, untreated surface waters are consumed for drinking and various household tasks in india making the public vulnerable to water-borne diseases and outbreaks. enterococci, the 'indicator' of water quality, correlates best with the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases as well as prevalence of other pathogenic microorganisms. therefore, this study aims to determine the distribution of species diversity, dissemination of antimicrobial-resistance and  virulence-markers in enterococci with respect to rural-urban landscape along river ganga in northern india. results: enterococci density (chi2: 1900, df: 1; p < 0.0001) increased from up-to-down gradient sites in the landscape. species diversity exhibit significant (chi2: 100.4, df: 20; p < 0.0001) and progressive distribution of e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans and e. hirae down the gradient. statistically discernible (p: 0.0156 - < 0.0001) background pool of resistance and virulence was observed among different enterococcus spp. recovered from five sites in the up-to-down gradient landscape. a significant correlation was observed in the distribution of multiple-antimicrobial-resistance (viz., erythromycin-rifampicin-gentamicin-methicillin and vancomycin-gentamicin-streptomycin; rs: 0.9747; p: 0.0083) and multiple-virulence-markers (viz., gele+esp+; rs: 0.9747; p: 0.0083; gele+efaa+; rs: 0.8944; p: 0.0417) among different enterococcus spp. conclusion: our observations show prevalence of multiple-antimicrobial-resistance as well as multiple-virulence traits among different enterococcus spp. the observed high background pool of resistance and virulence in enterococci in river waters of populous countries has the potential to disseminate more alarming antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic bacteria of same or other lineage in the environment. therefore, the presence of elevated levels of virulent enterococci with emerging vancomycin resistance in surface waters poses serious health risk in developing countries like india.

AB  == objective: to illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. methods: the bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility  to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from june 2007 to march 2008. results: among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. they included  34 gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). the commonest pathogens were escherichia coli (27.3%), enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and enterococcus faecium (10.9%). among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). the results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of gram negative strains to meropenem was 2.8%, followed by imipenem (5.6%), sulperazone (22.8%) and amikacin (28.7%). in this study gram negative strains were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, some third generation cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). none of gram positive strains were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. they  were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). conclusions: (1) gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary  tract infection in renji hospital and the commonest pathogen is escherichia coli. the infection of enterococcus is going up. the mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) to treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to escherichia coli are optimal choices. ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. sulperazone or amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. imipenem and vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.

TI  == evaluation of enterococcal surface protein genes as markers of sewage contamination in tropical recreational waters.
AB  == a molecular monitoring strategy was developed to detect prevalence of two enterococcal surface protein genes (esp-1 gene and esp-2 gene) in isolates of enterococci from recreational waters in hawaii as evidence of human sewage contamination. the sensitivity and specificity of the methods were evaluated in selected environmental samples including human sewage, ocean water samples near a sewage outfall, shoreline coastal beach waters, ambient soil samples and ambient  streams not known to be contaminated with sewage. the results of this study show  that the esp-1 and esp-2 genes are highly associated with enterococci from sewage sources as compared to non-point sources. therefore these esp genes show promise  as good indicators of sewage contamination. however, more sensitivity and specificity of esp genes are needed. moreover, a more specific enumeration method for e. faecium and e. faecalis is needed so that subsequent test for the esp genes will be reliable and feasible.

TI  == identification, antimicrobial resistance and genotypic characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated in porto alegre, brazil.
AB  == in the past two decades the members of the genus enterococcus have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. in the present study, we evaluated the  antimicrobial resistance and genotypic characteristics of 203 enterococcus spp. recovered from different clinical sources from two hospitals in porto alegre, rio grande do sul, brazil. the species were identified by conventional biochemical tests and by an automated system. the genetic diversity of e. faecalis presenting high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna after smai digestion. the e. faecalis was the  most frequent specie (93.6%), followed by e. faecium (4.4%). the antimicrobial resistance profile was: 2.5% to ampicillin, 0.5% to vancomycin, 0.5% teicoplanin, 33% to chloramphenicol, 2% to nitrofurantoin, 66.1% to erythromycin, 66.5% to tetracycline, 24.6% to rifampicin, 30% to ciprofloxacin and 87.2% to quinupristin-dalfopristin. a total of 10.3% of the isolates proved to be hlar to  both gentamicin and streptomycin (hlr-st/ge), with 23.6% resistant only to gentamicin (hlr-ge) and 37.4% only to streptomycin (hlr-st). one predominant clonal group was found among e. faecalis hlr-ge/st. the prevalence of resistance  among beta-lactam antibiotics and glycopeptides was very low. however, in this study there was an increased number of hlr enterococcus which may be spreading intra and inter-hospital.

TI  == comparative analysis on antibiotic resistance characteristics of listeria spp. and enterococcus spp. isolated from laying hens and eggs in conventional and organic keeping systems in bavaria, germany.
AB  == by investigating the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance characteristics of gram-positive bacteria from organic and conventional keeping systems of laying hens, it was to be determined to what extent these properties are influenced by the different systems. for this purpose, a total of 799 cloacal swabs and 800 egg samples were examined. prevalences for all selected bacteria from cloacal swabs were much the same for both organic and caged birds: listeria spp.1.3%[org] versus 1.6%[con]; enterococcus spp. 95.5%[org] versus 97.5%[con]. egg contents and eggshells were generally contaminated to a lesser extent, primarily with enterococcus spp. listeria isolates were susceptible to almost all tested antibiotics, only three listeria innocua from conventional keepings were resistant to clindamycin; one isolate additionally to imipenem. high percentages  of enterococcus faecalis were resistant to doxycycline and macrolides. enterococcus faecium proved to have high resistance rates to clindamycin, fosfomycin and erythromycin; 9.1% were even resistant to the reserve antibiotic synercid. further, enterococcus spp. showed higher resistance rates to doxycycline, erythromycin, fosfomycin and rifampicin. no glycopeptide resistant enterococci were detected. a correlation between keeping system and resistance/susceptibility rates could be demonstrated. in detail, e. faecalis from organic laying hen husbandries showed significant lower resistance prevalences to tylosin, streptomycin and doxycycline; susceptibility rates were higher for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. rifampicin and imipenem were more effective in isolates from conventional keepings (p < 0.05). the amounts of resistant isolates of the enterococcus raffinosus from organic farms were significantly lower, the amounts of sensitive isolates were significantly higher  than from conventional farms concerning eight antibiotics (p < 0.05). when comparing the susceptibility/resistance rates, as well as the mean minimum inhibitory concentrations values, the consistent tendency is that bacteria from organic layer flocks are more susceptible to antimicrobials. these results show that organic livestock farming plays a part in contributing to reduced antibiotic resistance.

TI  == uptake and persistence of human associated enterococcus in the mussel mytilus edulis: relevance for faecal pollution source tracking.
AB  == aims: micro-organisms and molecular markers for microbial source tracking (mst) in coastal waters are often present at low numbers, and often exhibit significant variability in time and space. in this study, we investigated the uptake, accumulation, and persistence of human associated enterococcus in the mussel mytilus edulis. methods and results: the human associated molecular markers esp in enterococcus faecium, and m66 in enterococcus faecalis were targetted by pcr in seawater and mussel samples from coastal sites affected by sewage contamination. both native mussels and mussels transplanted from pristine to polluted sites were included. the results showed that the esp and m66 markers were often not detectable in seawater whereas mussels were enriched in the markers. human associated e. faecalis accumulated rapidly in m. edulis, and reached maximum levels after 4-6 h with concentration 30-300 times greater than in the surrounding seawater. enterococcus faecalis retained in m. edulis showed a survival comparable to planktonic e. faecalis in seawater with half lives of 30 and 22 h, respectively. human associated markers remained detectable for 120 h in m. edulis after faecal contamination. conclusions: the study demonstrated that native and transplanted m. edulis can accumulate and retain human associated molecular markers relevant for mst. significance and impact of the study: mussels should be considered as additional targets in mst studies in coastal waters.

TI  == characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and dna identification of atypical lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == murf inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  == murf catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a murf inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. we now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines  dq1 and dq2. dq1 inhibited escherichia coli murf (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microm) and had modest activity (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (lps)-defective e. coli and wild-type e. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin b nonapeptide. dq2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. treatment of lps-defective e. coli cells with >or=2x mic of dq1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the murf substrate compared to the  control, a 70% decline in the amount of the murf product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of murf within bacteria. dq2 treatment of s. aureus resulted in similar effects on the murf substrate and product quantities. at lower levels of dq1 (<or=1x mic), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). however, a 50% increase in the amount of the murf product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation  of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. the overexpression of cloned murf appeared to partly alleviate the dq1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. the identification of murf inhibitors such as dq1 and dq2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that murf remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

AB  == the microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees c for 30 s. such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard greek cheeses. raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log cfu/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and pseudomonads. the lab flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the  most common lab isolates, followed by enterococcus durans, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc lactis. thermization at 60 degrees c for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log cfu/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log cfu/ml), and listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. thermization at 67 degrees c for 30 s had  a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. two nisin-producing l. lactis subsp. lactis strains (m78 and m104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing lab strains were isolated from thermized milk. thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable lab and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective lab strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.

TI  == occurrence, population structure, and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in  marginal and apical periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples and root canal samples were collected from 2,839 marginal periodontitis (mp) patients and 21 apical periodontitis (ap) patients. enterococcus species were identified by a series of phenotypic and genotypic tests. antimicrobial susceptibility assays were performed by an agar disk diffusion test. multilocus sequence typing (mlst), eburst, and minimum spanning tree were used for enterococcal genetic clustering and population analysis. enterococcus faecalis was recovered from 3.7% mp patients and 9.5% ap patients, and enterococcus faecium was recovered from 0.04% mp patients. enterococci were detected more often in older male patients. e. faecalis isolates of mp were found resistant to tetracycline (49.1%), erythromycin (8.5%), trimethoprim (2.8%), and  gentamicin (1.9%), while one ap isolate was resistant to tetracycline. a total of 40 sequence types (sts) were resolved in 108 e. faecalis isolates. comparison with e. faecalis international mlst database revealed that 27 sts were previously found, 13 sts were novel, and several major clonal complexes in the database were also found in mp isolates. the tetracycline-resistant isolates distributed mainly in the major clonal complexes and singletons, whereas the erythromycin-resistant  isolates were more dispersed. although the rate of occurrence of enterococci recovered in the mp and ap samples was low, 50% of these isolates are resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, which is most often tetracycline. this implies that subgingival e. faecalis might represent a reservoir of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin. the subgingival e. faecalis isolates show high genetic diversity but are grouped, in general, with the known isolates from the international database.

TI  == time-kill kinetics of oritavancin and comparator agents against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == objectives: oritavancin, a lipoglycopeptide, possesses bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. to understand the time dependence of oritavancin activity, we have undertaken time-kill experiments against isolates of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, including recent antibiotic-resistant strains. methods: six strains of s. aureus [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), vancomycin-resistant s. aureus  (vrsa)] and five strains of enterococci [vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; both vana and vanb)] were tested in time-kill assays; oritavancin assays included 0.002% polysorbate-80 to ensure quantitative drug recovery. oritavancin and comparators vancomycin, teicoplanin,  linezolid and daptomycin were tested at static concentrations approximating their free peak (fc(max)) and free trough (fc(min)) in plasma when administered at standard doses for complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: oritavancin showed concentration-dependent killing of all strains tested: at its  fc(max) predicted from a 200 mg dose in humans, oritavancin exerted bactericidal  activity (> or =3 log kill relative to starting inoculum) against mssa, mrsa and  vrsa within 1 h and against vse between 11 and 24 h. at predicted fc(max) from an 800 mg dose, oritavancin was bactericidal against visa strains at 24 h and against vre at 10 h. conclusions: oritavancin displayed concentration-dependent killing of mssa, mrsa, vrsa, visa, vse and vre. oritavancin was more rapidly bactericidal against all strains tested than were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid or daptomycin at physiologically relevant concentrations. these data support the conclusion that oritavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity on recent, drug-resistant isolates of s. aureus and enterococci.

TI  == molecular diversity and transferability of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m), carried on tn916-1545 family transposons, in enterococci from a total food chain.
AB  == in the present study, 20 enterococci belonging to the species enterococcus faecalis (12 strains), enterococcus faecium (4), enterococcus durans (2), enterococcus hirae (1) and enterococcus mundtii (1) and originating from a total  production chain of swine meat commodities were analysed to investigate the diversity of their tetracycline resistance gene tet(m). pcr-rflp and sequence analysis showed that the tet(m) gene of most strains can be correlated with the tn916 transposon. conversely, tet(m) of six e. faecalis and the e. hirae strain,  all isolated from pig faecal samples, may be associated with previously undescribed members of the tn916-1545 transposon family. in vitro filter conjugation trials showed the ability of 50% of the enterococcal strains, including e. mundtii, to transfer the tet(m) gene (and the associated tn916 and new transposons) to e. faecalis or listeria innocua recipient strains. tet(m) gene transfer to l. innocua recipient was also directly observed in meat food products. collectively, these sequence and conjugation data indicate that various transposons can be responsible of the spread of tetracycline resistance in enterococci and validate the opinion that enterococcus species are important sources of antibiotic resistance genes for potentially pathogenic bacteria occurring in the food chain.

TI  == bioactivation of selenocysteine derivatives by beta-lyases present in common gastrointestinal bacterial species.
AB  == studies in cell cultures and animal models have demonstrated cancer chemopreventive effects of certain selenium compounds. here we describe the screening of cysteine s-conjugate beta-lyase activity in bacterial species that are implicated in the bio-activation of sulfur- and selenocysteine derivatives. we screened a range of bacterial species commonly found in the human intestine for beta-lyase activity on se-p-methoxybenzylselenocysteine and the natural occurring s-methylcysteine and se-methylselenocysteine conjugates. a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)-assisted assay was established to determine specific activities of each strain. of the 29 tested bacterial species, 22 showed specific activities towards the test compound reaching up to 10.1 u/mg  protein, thereby accounting for 75% of total fecal activity (13.3. u/mg protein). lysates of four bacterial strains (bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides vulgatus,  enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium), which exhibited high specific activities towards the test compound and which are known to be present at high numbers in the human intestine, were characterized further. our results indicate  that beta-lyase activity is widely distributed in human intestinal bacteria and might play a key role in the bioactivation of selenocysteine derivatives.

AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == isolation and identification of tyramine-producing enterococci from human fecal samples.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are recognized as a group of important microorganisms  because of their crucial role in food fermentation and their contribution to the  maintenance of health homeostasis, as natural inhabitants of the human mucosa. however, the metabolic activities of some strains, such as the ability to synthesize biogenic amines (bas), can be detrimental to human health. bas are low molecular weight compounds synthesized by the enzymatic decarboxylation of amino  acids. tyramine, one of the most biologically active bas, is produced by certain  strains of lab related to food fermentations. since no data are available as to whether tyramine originates exclusively from food intake, or, like polyamines, could be formed by gut bacteria, this study was focused on the isolation of tyramine-producing lab from human feces. different strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis able to produce tyramine in culture conditions  were isolated.

TI  == spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == new combinations of mutations in vand-type vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus avium strains.

AB  == the pharmacodynamics of resistance development to linezolid has not been extensively studied, especially when a large bacterial inoculum is exposed to this agent. we simulated the usual therapeutic dose of linezolid, 600 mg intravenously every 12h [estimated maximum concentration, area under the concentration-time curve (auc) and half-life of 10.4 mg/l, 61.9 microg h/ml and 4.8h, respectively], in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model and investigated the applicability of the mutant selection window (msw) to linezolid against vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. four strains were studied, including vancomycin-susceptible (atcc 29212) and -resistant (atcc 51299) e. faecalis and vancomycin-susceptible (gp33) and -resistant (gp32) e. faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for all  strains was 2mg/l; mutant prevention concentration (mpc) values were 4 mg/l for atcc 29212 and gp33 and 8 mg/l for atcc 51299 and gp32. linezolid failed to achieve bactericidal action against atcc 29212 and gp33 [auc/mic=30.95, auc/mpc=15.48, %t(msw) (% of the dosing interval that concentrations fall in the  msw)=40%] and atcc 51299 and gp32 (auc/mic=30.95, auc/mpc=7.74, %t(msw)=80.1%). linezolid-resistant subpopulations (mic=8 mg/l) of all isolates were selected. our data suggest that linezolid resistance in enterococci will continue to emerge upon continued use of this antimicrobial.

AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

AB  == a lactic acid bacterial strain was isolated from human fecal specimen and identified as enterococcus faecalis sl-5. the isolated strain showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens assayed, especially the highest activity against propionibacterium acnes. the antimicrobial substance was purified and verified as a bacteriocin (named esl5) of e. faecalis sl-5 by activity-staining using p. acnes as an indicator. n-terminal sequence of esl5 was determined (mgaiaklvak) and sequence analysis revealed that it is almost identical to the some of enterocins including l50a/b of e. faecium l50 and mr10a/b of e. faecalis mrr 10-3. from the sequencing data of l50a/b structural genes, the nucleotide sequence showed 100% identity with that of the mr10a/b structural genes, implying that esl5 is an equivalent of enterocin mr10. meanwhile, we also tested the therapeutic effect of anti-p. acnes activity in patients with mild to moderate acne because of its pathogenic role to acne vulgaris. for this purpose, a concentrated powder of cbt sl-5 was prepared using  cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of e. faecalis sl-5 and included in a lotion for application in the patients. the study showed that cbt sl-5 lotion significantly reduced the inflammatory lesions like pustules compared to the placebo lotion. therefore our results indicate that the anti-p. acnes activity produced by e. faecalis sl-5 has potential role to the treatment of acne as an alternative to topical antibiotics.

TI  == structural organization of a complex family of palindromic repeats in enterococci.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis/faecium repeats (efars) are miniature insertion sequences spread in the genome of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. unit-length repeats measure 165-170 bp and contain two modules (b and t) capable  of folding independently into stem-loop sequences, connected by a short, unstructured module j. the e. faecalis elements feature only one type of b, j and t modules. in contrast, the e. faecium elements result from the assembly of different types of b, j and t modules, and may vary in length because they carry  multiple b modules. most efars are located close (0-20 bp) to orf stop codons, and are thus cotranscribed with upstream flanking genes. in both e. faecalis and  e. faecium cells, efar transcripts accumulate in a strand-dependent fashion. data suggest that t modules function as bidirectional transcriptional terminators, which provide a 3'-end to gene transcripts spanning b modules, while blocking antisense transcripts coming in from the opposite direction.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis with the gelatinase phenotype regulated by the fsr operon and with biofilm-forming capacity are common in the agricultural environment.
AB  == the prevalence of gelatinase activity and biofilm formation among environmental enterococci was assessed. in total, 396 enterococcal isolates from swine and cattle faeces and house flies from a cattle farm were screened for gelatinase activity. the most prevalent phenotype on todd-hewitt agar with 1.5% skim milk was the weak protease (wp) (72.2% of isolates), followed by the strong protease (sp) 18.7%, and no protease (np) (9.1%). the majority of wp isolates was represented by enterococcus hirae (56.9%), followed by enterococcus faecium (25.9%), enterococcus casseliflavus (10.4%), enterococcus gallinarum (5.2%) and enterococcus saccharolyticus (1.7%). all wp isolates were negative for gele (gelatinase) and spre (serine protease) as well as the fsrabdc operon that regulates the two proteases, and only four isolates (7.0%) formed biofilms in vitro. all sp isolates were enterococcus faecalis positive for the fsrabdc, gele, spre genes and the majority (91.2%) formed a biofilm. diversity of np isolates was relatively evenly distributed among e. hirae, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, enterococcus durans, e. saccharolyticus and enterococcus mundtii.  all np isolates were negative for the fsr operon and only four e. hirae (11.1%) formed a biofilm. of further interest was the loss of the gelatinase phenotype (18.9% of isolates) from sp isolates after 4 month storage at 4-8 degrees c and several passages of subculture. results of reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that mrna was produced for all the genes in the frs operon and sequencing of the gele gene did not reveal any significant mutations. however, gelatinase was not detectable by western blot analysis. our study shows that e. faecalis with the complete fsr operon and the potential to form a biofilm are relatively common in the agricultural environment and may represent a source/reservoir of clinically relevant strains. in addition, many environmental  enterococci, especially e. hirae, produce an unknown wp that can hydrolyse casein but does not contribute to biofilm formation. the stability of the gelatinase phenotype in e. faecalis and its regulation will require additional studies.

AB  == background: tr-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug tr-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous gram-positive species. in this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of tr-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. methods: one hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. species of isolates were: enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16  wild-type strains); enterococcus faecium (55/55), staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23s rrna target mutations or cfr genes were detected  by pcr and sequencing. results: among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were g2576t (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from europe, far east and north and south america. most strains were  multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin b. tr-700 mic values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. tr-700 mic results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/l for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest tr-700 mic elevations compared with linezolid controls. conclusions: tr-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of gram-positive cocci. a significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/l) of tr-700. all strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had tr-700 mic results at < or = 8 mg/l.

TI  == daptomycin for the treatment of enterococcal bacteraemia: results from the cubicin outcomes registry and experience (core).
AB  == enterococcal infections are a common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections.  vancomycin resistance and the emergence of linezolid resistance necessitate alternative therapies. studies in vitro as well as animal and case studies suggest that daptomycin may be effective in enterococcal infections. patients with positive blood cultures for enterococci in the cubicin((r)) outcomes registry and experience (core) 2005-2006 were identified. patients with endocarditis, intracardiac foreign body infections or non-speciated enterococci were excluded. outcome was assessed using protocol-defined criteria. of 159 patients included in the efficacy population, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were isolated in 120 (75.5%) and 39 (24.5%) patients, respectively. vancomycin resistance was detected in 91% and 23% of patients with  e. faecium and e. faecalis infections, respectively. prior to daptomycin, 94/159  (59.1%) and 35/159 (22.0%) patients had received vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. daptomycin was first-line therapy in 27/159 cases (17%). success was observed in 139/159 patients (87%) and in 104/120 (87%) and 35/39 (90%) patients with e. faecium and e. faecalis infections, respectively. among the safety population (n=211), 20 (9.5%) experienced 28 adverse events possibly related to daptomycin, 8 of which were considered serious. daptomycin may be a useful agent for treating enterococcal bacteraemia caused by e. faecium or e. faecalis. further studies are warranted.

TI  == the homogeneity of vanb gene cluster among enterococcal isolates in iran.
AB  == aims: this study aimed to analyse the diversity of the vanb gene cluster in enterococcal species isolated from sewage treatment plants (stp) in tehran, iran. methods and results: the enterococcal isolates were collected from three sewage treatment plants in tehran, iran, during 2005. a total of 203 enterococcal isolates, collected over six rounds of sampling from three stps were tested for the presence of vanb gene. long-pcr showed that amongst the isolates, three enterococcus faecium, one enterococcus gallinarum and one enterococcus casseliflavus harboured the complete vanb gene cluster. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the vanb1 gene cluster (5900 bp) from the isolates  showed an identical pattern to a standard strain of enterococcus faecalis (v583). none of the isolates were able to transfer the vanb gene in conjugation experiments. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for the three e. faecium isolates with vanb gene clusters. conclusions: our results indicated that the dissemination of vanb is not widespread in tehran. although only a few vanb positive isolates were detected, vanb was found in several enterococcal species. significance and impact of the study: in view of the lack of information on vanb resistance genes and their diversity in iran, knowledge of the global dissemination of vanb genes in enterococcus spp. is noteworthy.

TI  == blood stream infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: reemergence of gram-negative rods and increasing antibiotic resistance.
AB  == blood stream infections (bsi) are a well-known cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) patients. the aim of this study was  to analyze etiology and microbial resistance of bsi in patients undergoing allogeneic hsct in a single center over a 4-year period (2004-2007). there were 168 episodes of bsi in 132 patients (median 10 days after hsct) and 182 pathogens were isolated. gram-positive bacteria (gpb) accounted for 57% of 182 isolates. gram-negative rods (gnr) for 37% and fungi for 6%. all patients received routine  fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. there was a significant decrease in gpb/gnr ratio over time, from 2.4 in 2004 to 1 in 2007 (p = .043). among gpb, staphylococci decreased from 37 of 68 (64%) in 2004-2005 to 8 of 35 (23%) in 2006-2007 (p < .002). the enterococcus faecalis/e. faecium ratio decreased from 4.5 in 2004 to 0.33 in 2007 (p = .006), whereas the total number of enterococcal strains per year did not change. the incidence of escherichia coli among gnr increased from 3 of 15 (20%) in 2004 to 13 of 21 (62%) in 2007 (p = .003). fluoroquinolone-resistance was common, both among gpb and gnr (81% and 74%, respectively). mortality rate at 7 days after bsi was 11% (19 of 168), reaching 39% for pseudomonas aeruginosa bsi (7 of 18). bsi remains a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hsct, the causative organism influencing 7- and 30-day mortality rate. bsi etiology may change rapidly, requiring implementation of new empirical-therapy schemes.

TI  == vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) still persist in slaughtered poultry in hungary 8 years after the ban on avoparcin.
AB  == in this report we examined the glycopeptide susceptibility of enterococci, isolated in 2005, from slaughtered animals, within the confines of hungarian antibiotic resistance monitoring system. we determined the presence of the van genes as well as their genetic relatedness in enterococci from poultry. enterococcus sp. strains (n=175) were collected from intestinal samples of slaughtered poultry in 2005. the origin of the samples was registered at county level. after screening the strains with 30 mg vancomycin disc 19 (86%) intermediate resistant and 4 (3%) fully resistant strains were found. the distribution of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)-values among 23 enterococcus strains which were intermediate or resistant to vancomycin were 0.25 mg/l (4.4%), 2 mg/l (8.6%), 4 mg/l (8.6%), 8 mg/l (61%), 16 mg/l (8.6%) and 256 mg/l (8.6%). the mics of teicoplanin were 0.25 mg/l (4.3%), 1 (8.6%), 4 mg/l (78.3%), 16 mg/l (4.3%) and 256 mg/l (4.3%). the two most vancomycin-resistant strains were vana carriers (1 e. faecalis and 1 e. faeciuum). the farms that produced these strains can be reservoirs of vre and the affected farms should change the technology of disinfection and breeding in order to prevent the emergence of high numbers of human vre isolates in hungary.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == enterococci from artisanal dairy products show high levels of adaptability.
AB  == enterococci are ubiquitous organisms able to promote both health (fermented food/probiotics) and illness (human/animal infections). disturbingly, several enterococcal species commonly found in artisanal cheeses, such as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, are being increasingly established as causes of infection, posing a problem for food safety. in this study enterococci from ewe's milk and cheese were compared to clinical and reference strains by growth in media simulating environmental colonization and infection sites: 2yt, bhi, skim milk, urine and rabbit serum at different phs, nacl concentrations and temperatures. growth curves were obtained with microbiology workstation bioscreen c and used to calculate relative indexes--ris--(based on absorbance, lag phase and specific growth rate) for each strain and environmental condition. similar or higher ris were obtained for food strains growing in infection-related environments when compared to clinical ones, revealing their ability to adapt and grow in these conditions. a dendrogram built using pearson's correlation coefficient and a pca analysis clustered the strains regardless of their origin or species allocation, suggesting a strain-specific mode of growth and a high environmental adaptability of enterococcal strains. these evidences turn essential the evaluation of strains to be used as starters or probiotics.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of fecal bacterial composition from surface water through aquifer sand material.
AB  == when bacterial pathogens from livestock contaminate drinking water supplies, they can cause different forms of gastroenteritis. the objective of this study was to  enumerate the concentrations of fecal indicator (escherichia coli and enterococci) in surface water in order to determine removal efficiency by sand filtration. the concentrations of different indicator bacterial species were determined after running tertiary treated water through two tanks containing aquifer material. enterococcus faecalis primers targeting the ddl gene and primers for enterococcus faecium were used to identify the two species in the samples. a pcr assay based on the partial sequence of the 13-d-glucoronidase gene (uida) for specific detection and differentiation of e. coli populations was used to confirm the presence of e. coli after a biochemical test. the biochemical test overestimated the percentage of e. faecium in our samples, but the pcr assay with the ddl gene produced 100% specificity with enterococcus faecalis. the biochemical test was 91.5% specific in identifying e. coli. the composition of indicator bacteria in santa ana river was dominated by intestinal microflora of humans and animals; filtration by aquifer sand material may reduce the transport  of indicator bacteria from surface water to groundwater.

TI  == longer intestinal persistence of enterococcus faecalis compared to enterococcus faecium clones in intensive-care-unit patients.
AB  == the dynamics of intestinal colonization with enterococcal clones in intensive-care-unit (icu) patients was evaluated. eight patients admitted directly to the neurosurgical icu at the ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain) from the community and with no overlapping stay during a 10-month period in 2006 were studied. rectal swab specimens were collected on admission and daily until the patients were discharged. clonality was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. clonal colonization dynamics were estimated by using two new parameters: the clonal diversity per patient per day (cdpd) and the clonal persistence ratio (cpr). enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 123) and enterococcus faecium isolates (n = 66) were resolved into 13 and 15 clones, respectively. the cdpd of e. faecalis steadily increased during admission, and e. faecalis showed a higher (p = 0.001)  cpr value than e. faecium (0.86 and 0.42, respectively). e. faecium, with the exception of an ampicillin-resistant clone belonging to clonal complex 17, frequently appeared as a short-term colonizer, even though the e. faecalis clones had significantly (p = 0.03) more days under antibiotic exposure than e. faecium  (77.5 and 65 days/100 colonization days, respectively). e. faecalis had a longer  persistence than e. faecium, except for the cc17 ampicillin-resistant clone, and  e. faecalis showed a cumulative increase in cdpd, whereas e. faecium did not. cdpd and cpr were useful for measuring the dynamics of intestinal colonization with enterococcal clones.

TI  == molecular detection of aggregation substance, enterococcal surface protein, and cytolysin genes and in vitro adhesion to urinary catheters of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium of clinical origin.
AB  == it has been hypothesized that nosocomial enterococci might have virulence factors that enhance their ability to colonise hospitalised patients. the objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of genes encoding 3 virulence factors: aggregation substance (asa1), enterococcal surface protein (esp), and 5  genes within the cytolysin operon (cyla, cylb, cylm, cyll(l), cyll(s)) and cytolysin production in 115 enterococcal clinical isolates (21 enterococcus faecium and 94 e. faecalis). adhesion to siliconized latex urinary catheters in relation to presence of esp was analysed in a subset of isolates. the isolates were previously characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). esp was the only virulence gene found in e. faecium. it was found in 71% of the 21 e. faecium isolates. asa1, esp, and the cyl operon were found in 79%, 73% and 13% respectively, of the 94 e. faecalis isolates. there was a complete agreement between presence of the cyl operon and phenotypic cytolysin production. isolates  belonging to a cluster of genetically related isolates carried esp and asa1 more  often when compared to unique isolates. no difference was found with respect to cyl genes. e. faecalis isolates adhered with higher bacterial densities than e. faecium. e. faecalis isolates within the same pfge cluster adhered with similar bacterial densities, but there was no association between adhesion and the presence of esp when isolates within the same cluster were compared. in conclusion, e. faecalis isolates with high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) belonging to clusters of genetically related isolates widely distributed in swedish hospitals, were likely to carry both esp and asa1. adhesion was not affected by esp.

TI  == screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  == bovine mastitis (bm) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. the prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. in the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. a screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of ph, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation  and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins.  the other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. one hundred and two lab strains were isolated. most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. no correlation between these properties was found. antagonistic  metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. most  of the pre-selected strains were identified as streptococcus bovis and weissella  paramesenteroides. three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. the results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent bm.

TI  == environmental occurrence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene is an unreliable indicator of human fecal contamination.
AB  == the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene found in enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium has recently been explored as a marker of sewage pollution in recreational waters but its occurrence and distribution in environmental enterococci has not been well-documented. if the esp gene is found in environmental samples, there are potential implications for microbial source tracking applications. in the current study, a total of 452 samples (lake water,  100; stream water, 129; nearshore sand, 96; and backshore sand, 71; cladophora sp. (chlorophyta), 41; and periphyton (mostly bacillariophyceae), 15) collected from the coastal watersheds of southern lake michigan were selectively cultured for enterococci and then analyzed for the esp gene by pcr, targeting e. faecalis/ e. faecium (esp(fs/fm)) and e. faecium (esp(fm)). overall relative frequencies for esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) were 27.4 and 5.1%. respective percent frequency for the esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was 36 and 14% in lake water, 38.8 and 2.3% in stream  water, 24 and 6.3% in nearshore sand; 0% in backshore sand; 24.4 and 0% in cladophora sp.; and 33.3 and 0% in periphyton. the overall occurrence of both esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was significantly related (chi2 = 49, p < 0.0001). post-rain incidence of esp(fs/fm) increased in lake and stream water and nearshore sand. further, e. coli and enterococci cell densities were significant  predictors for esp(fs/fm) occurrence in post-rain lake water, but esp(fm) was not f+ coliphage densities were not significant predictors for esp(fm) or esp(fs/fm)  gene incidence. in summary, the differential occurrence of the esp gene in the environment suggests that it is not limited to human fecal sources and thus may weaken its use as a reliable tool in discriminating contaminant sources (i.e., human vs. nonhuman).

AB  == nowadays, six types of acquired vancomycin resistance in enterococci are known; however, only vana and to a lesser extent vanb are widely prevalent. various genes encode acquired vancomycin resistance and these are typically associated with mobile genetic elements which allow resistance to spread clonally and laterally. the major reservoir of acquired vancomycin resistance is enterococcus  faecium; vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis are still rare. population analysis of e. faecium has revealed a distinct subpopulation of hospital-acquired strain types, which can be differentiated by molecular typing methods (mlva, mlst) from human commensal and animal strains. hospital-acquired e. faecium have  additional genomic content (accessory genome) including several factors known or  supposed to be virulence-associated. acquired ampicillin resistance is a major phenotypic marker of hospital-acquired e. faecium in europe and experience has shown that it often precedes increasing rates of vre with a delay of several years. several factors are known to promote vre colonisation and transmission; however, despite having populations with similar predispositions and preconditions, rates of vre vary all over europe.

TI  == comparison of susceptibility to opsonic killing by in vitro human immune response of enterococcus strains isolated from dairy products, clinical samples and probiotic preparation.
AB  == the genus enterococcus like other lab has also been featured in food and probiotic industry for decades due to its specific biochemical traits and beneficial health claims. at the same time, some enterococcal strains present an  emerging pool of opportunistic pathogens for humans and are frequently armed with potential virulence factors. thus, there is a need to assure the safety of enterococci before their use in food and probiotic preparations. opsonophagocytic assay is an important test for the safety assessment of enterococci. in the present study comparative safety assessment of the different enterococcal strains isolated from dairy products, faeces, clinical samples and a commercial probiotic preparation was carried out by in vitro opsonophagocytic assay. eleven strains of enterococcus spp. were tested for their susceptibility to killing by opsonophagocytic assay. among them, six isolates (enterococcus faecium strain) were from our previous study (isolated from dairy products and faecal sample), four were from clinical samples and one from a probiotic preparation. five out of six previous isolates and the isolate from probiotic preparation showed higher susceptibility to killing in contrast to the clinical isolates. the difference in the susceptibility to opsonic killing among the clinical and non-clinical enterococcus isolates may be attributed to the presence of a capsule in the former, which protect them against the opsonophagocytic killing. thus, these susceptible e. faecium strains may be designated as safe. however, certain other  virulence traits must be evaluated prior to their exploitation in food and probiotic preparations.

TI  == enterococcal infections & antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == enterococci have traditionally regarded as low grade pathogens, have emerged as an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in the last decade. although about a dozen enterococcus species have been identified, only two are responsible for the majority of human infections, i.e., enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. the most common nosocomial infections produced by these organisms are urinary tract infections (associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial resistance), followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. they also cause surgical wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis and rarely  meningitis. a major reason why these organisms survive in hospital environment is the intrinsic resistance to several commonly used antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, their ability to acquire resistance to all currently available antibiotics, either by mutation or by receipt of foreign genetic material through the transfer of plasmids and transposons. the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) is a cause of concern, as once established, it is very difficult to control. moreover, there can be transfer of resistant gene from enterococci to staphylococcus aureus thereby posing a threat to the patient safety and also challenges for the treating physicians. this review highlights the shifting spectrum of enterococcal infections, along with their geographical distribution and growing nosocomial importance. emergence of antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity and virulence factors, current preventive, control and  treatment modalities of severe enterococcal infections are also dealt with.

AB  == as a part of our search for biologically active compounds from cultivated salvia  spp. we investigated salvia corrugata vahl. the activity of two isolated icetaxane diterpene quinones, fruticuline a and demethylfruticuline a, was assessed against 46 bacterial pathogens, mostly resistant to several primary antibiotics. the mic for all the inhibited gram-positive pathogens tested showed  a very narrow distribution and ranged from 32 to 64 mg/l, regardless of their resistance patterns to other antibiotics. demethylfruticuline a was shown to be highly bactericidal (>3 log(10) cfu decrease within 24 h) against staphylococcus  aureus and s. epidermidis and bacteriostatic against enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. fruticuline a manifested bacteriostatic activity against all tested strains. s. corrugata can be viewed as an interesting source for these diterpenes, which, if well tolerated in vivo, may represent new medical agents useful for the treatment of serious infections caused by resistant gram-positive  pathogens.

TI  == relation of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates from foods and clinical specimens.
AB  == clinical enterococcus faecalis (n=65) and enterococcus faecium (n=12) blood isolates from three swiss hospitals were characterized with testing for resistance to antimicrobial agents, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), and  the occurrence of virulence factors. phenotypic determination of resistance to antimicrobial agents resulted in 20% of e. faecalis isolates showing a triple resistance against chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and seven isolates (two e. faecalis and five e. faecium) exhibiting a multiresistance against five or more antimicrobials. one isolate each of e. faecalis and e. faecium showed vancomycin resistance. all isolates contained at least two of the  nine tested virulence genes (agg, gele, cyl, esp, efaafs, efaafm, cpd, cob, and ccf). phylogenetic analysis of the pfge profiles identified several small clusters within e. faecalis isolates, one of which included isolates of all three hospitals. fifty-six (73%) isolates occurred as unique, patient-specific clones.  several pfge types were associated with shared features in their resistance patterns, indicating spread between and within wards. finally, enterococci from this study and previous isolates from cheeses were examined by pfge typing. the comparison of pfge profiles from human and food isolates resulted in clusters of  genetically strong related strains, which suggests high similarities of the enterococcal community composition of these two environments. a possible spread of the enterococcal isolates through the food supply cannot be excluded.

TI  == emergence and management of drug-resistant enterococcal infections.
AB  == the treatment of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections continues to be a challenge for clinicians. glycopeptide and beta-lactam resistance is now a common feature of the majority of enterococcus faecium hospital isolates, and resistance to aminoglycosides, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid and daptomycin further complicates the problem. new antibiotics, such as tigecycline, lipoglycopeptides  (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and cephalosporins with activity against enterococcus faecalis (ceftobiprole and ceftaroline), may have potential  activity against certain resistant enterococcal strains in specific clinical settings, as may some older antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, minocycline and nitrofurantoin. however, the treatment of endovascular infections (particularly endocarditis, where bactericidal therapy is important for optimal cure rates) caused by resistant enterococci continues to be an immense challenge even with the availability of new agents. the optimal therapy for these infections is not well established and clinical data are usually limited to case reports with conflicting results. therefore, treatment decisions may have to be based on animal models and sporadic experiences and the  best approach is for the physician to consider carefully each patient on a case by case manner and gather all the clinical and microbiological information possible regarding species identification and susceptibilities in order to choose a therapeutic regimen that would appear to be active.

TI  == identification and phenotypic characterization of a second collagen adhesin, scm, and genome-based identification and analysis of 13 other predicted mscramms, including four distinct pilus loci, in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == attention has recently been drawn to enterococcus faecium because of an increasing number of nosocomial infections caused by this species and its resistance to multiple antibacterial agents. however, relatively little is known  about the pathogenic determinants of this organism. we have previously identified a cell-wall-anchored collagen adhesin, acm, produced by some isolates of e. faecium, and a secreted antigen, saga, exhibiting broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins. here, we analysed the draft genome of strain tx0016 for potential microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (mscramms). genome-based bioinformatics identified 22 predicted cell-wall-anchored e. faecium surface proteins (fms), of which 15 (including acm) had characteristics typical of mscramms, including predicted folding into a modular architecture with multiple immunoglobulin-like domains. functional characterization of one [fms10; redesignated second collagen adhesin of e. faecium (scm)] revealed that recombinant scm(65) (a- and b-domains) and scm(36) (a-domain) bound to collagen type v efficiently in a concentration-dependent manner, bound considerably less to collagen type i and fibrinogen, and differed from acm in their binding specificities to collagen types iv and v. results from  far-uv circular dichroism measurements of recombinant scm(36) and of acm(37) indicated that these proteins were rich in beta-sheets, supporting our folding predictions. whole-cell elisa and facs analyses unambiguously demonstrated surface expression of scm in most e. faecium isolates. strikingly, 11 of the 15 predicted mscramms clustered in four loci, each with a class c sortase gene; nine of these showed similarity to enterococcus faecalis ebp pilus subunits and also contained motifs essential for pilus assembly. antibodies against one of the predicted major pilus proteins, fms9 (redesignated ebpc(fm)), detected a 'ladder' pattern of high-molecular-mass protein bands in a western blot analysis of cell surface extracts from e. faecium, suggesting that ebpc(fm) is polymerized into a  pilus structure. further analysis of the transcripts of the corresponding gene cluster indicated that fms1 (ebpa(fm)), fms5 (ebpb(fm)) and ebpc(fm) are co-transcribed, a result consistent with those for pilus-encoding gene clusters of other gram-positive bacteria. all 15 genes occurred frequently in 30 clinically derived diverse e. faecium isolates tested. the common occurrence of mscramm- and pilus-encoding genes and the presence of a second collagen-binding protein may have important implications for our understanding of this emerging pathogen.

TI  == immunogenic proteins in the cell envelope and cytoplasm of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == because of the continuous advent of new modes of antimicrobial resistance, it has become difficult to control vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with standard  antibiotics. therefore, in the interest of public health, early diagnostic methods and a greater knowledge of the pathogenic process are urgently needed to  prevent the spread of vre in humans and animals. to this end, we sought immunogenic proteins suitable for the serological diagnosis of vana-, vanb-, vanc1-, and vanc2-type vre. proteins were extracted from cell envelope (ce) and cytoplasm (cp), and anti-vre guinea pig serum was used to identify immunogenic proteins. two immunogenic proteins of 129 and 29 kda were identified in the ce and cp of vana, respectively, while a 28-kda protein was identified in the cp of  vanb. additionally, the ce of vanc1 contained two immunogenic proteins of 30 and  46 kda, while the cp of vanc1 contained two proteins of 19 and 30 kda. the ce of  vanc2 possessed one immunogenic protein of 40 kda. these proteins, which were specific to individual subtypes of vre, will likely prove useful in the serological diagnosis of enterococcal infections and in the study of enterococcal pathogenesis.

AB  == an unusual increase in infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus gallinarum (vreg) was identified in may 2004, in a colombian tertiary care teaching hospital. a case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. all vreg isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) typing. additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of e. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of e. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. eleven cases of vreg were identified between may through june 2004. vreg was isolated from blood (n=4), surgical secretions (n=4), paranasal sinus secretion (n=1), lung abscess (n=1) and urine (n=1). infections with vreg were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for vreg infection. all isolates were identified as e. gallinarum, harboured the vanc1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by pfge. virulence-associated genes were not detected. this is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of vreg and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination.

AB  == pmg1 (65.1 kb) is a highly conjugative, pheromone-independent enterococcus faecium plasmid that carries a tn4001-like transposon encoding gentamicin resistance. the complete nucleotide sequence (65 029 bp) of the pmg1 plasmid was  determined and 73 orfs lying in the same transcription orientation were identified. sixty-one of the 73 orfs showed a high degree of similarity (90-100%  identity at the amino acid level) to the orfs of the phtbeta plasmids. like the phtbeta plasmid, 22 of the pmg1 plasmid orfs showed homology with orfs present on the pxo2 plasmid (96.2 kb), which is the virulence plasmid essential for capsular formation by bacillus anthracis. analysis of tra mutants created by tn917 insertion and northern analysis of transcripts indicated that orfs 15-49, lying in the 31.7 kb region between 13.6 and 45.3 kb on the plasmid map, were related to transfer. this region was designated as the tra i region of pmg1. a 5.9-kb hindiii fragment that replicates autonomously in enterococcus faecalis was cloned and analysis of this fragment by deletion and in vitro insertion mutations showed that orf10 (rep) and the inverted repeat sequence in the noncoding region between orf8 and orf9 were necessary for pmg1 replication.

AB  == vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics. vancomycin resistance (van) gene clusters are found in human pathogens such as enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-producing  actinomycetes such as amycolotopsis orientalis, actinoplanes teichomyceticus and  streptomyces toyocaensis and the nonglycopeptide producing actinomycete streptomyces coelicolor. expression of the van genes is activated by the vans/vanr two-component system in response to extracellular glycopeptide antibiotic. two major types of inducible vancomycin resistance are found in pathogenic bacteria; vana strains are resistant to vancomycin itself and also to  the lipidated glycopeptide teicoplanin, while vanb strains are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin. here we discuss the enzymes the van genes encode, the range of different vans/vanr two-component systems, the biochemistry of vans/vanr, the nature of the effector ligand(s) recognised by vans and the evolution of the van cluster.

AB  == background: breast milk is an important source of staphylococci and other bacterial groups to the infant gut. the objective of this work was to analyse the bacterial diversity in feces of breast-fed infants and to compare it with that of formula-fed ones. a total of 23 women and their respective infants (16 breast-fed and 7 formula-fed) participated in the study. the 16 women and their infants provided a sample of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 7, 14, and 35.  the samples were plated onto different culture media. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling and to a characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits and sensitivity to antibiotics. results: the feeding practice had a significant effect on bacterial counts. a total of 1,210 isolates (489 from milk, 531 from breast-fed and 190 from formula-fed infants) were identified. staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant species in milk and feces of breast-fed infants while it was less prevalent in those of formula fed-infants. enterococcus faecalis was the second predominant bacterial species among the fecal samples provided by the breast-fed infants but it was also present in all the samples from the formula-fed ones. the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were only detected in a low number of the s. epidermidis strains. several enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla or the vanabdeg antibiotic-resistance genes. all were sensitive to vancomycin. conclusion: the presence of s. epidermidis is a differential trait of the fecal microbiota of breast-fed infants. globally, the staphyloccal isolates obtained from milk and feces of breast-fed infants contain a low number of virulence determinants and are sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested.

AB  == background: during the last decade, enterococci have become important nosocomial  pathogens, representing the second leading cause of urinary tract infections. this increasing prevalence has been paralleled by the occurrence of multi-drug resistant (mdr) and high-level gentamicin resistant (hlgr) strains. methods: from september 2005 to 2006, a total of 638 enterococcal isolates were collected from  urine samples among 9 medical centers in tehran (iran). confirmation of species and detection of gentamicin resistance genes were done by pcr method. anti-microbial susceptibility test was determined with disk diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration of gentamicin among hlgr isolates assayed by microdilution methods. results: the isolates were found to consist of enterococcus faecalis (77.8%) and enterococcus faecium (22.2%). the results obtained from pcr showed a high rate of agreement with phenotypic assays for both species. mdr to most prevalent anti-microbials was present in 29% and 72% of the  e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, respectively. hlgr phenotype was detected in 64% of e. faecalis and 92% of e. faecium isolates. the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene were identified in 83% of e. faecalis and 100% of e. faecium hlgr isolates.  e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates differed in their susceptibilities to different antibiotics. conclusion: emergence of multi-resistant enterococci and high level resistance to gentamicin shown by enterococcal strains is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.

TI  == virulence factors and bacteriocins in faecal enterococci of wild boars.
AB  == the production of antimicrobial, haemolytic and gelatinase activities was tested  in 67 enterococci (39 e. faecium, 24 e. hirae, 2 e. faecalis, and 2 enterococcus  spp.), recovered from faecal samples of wild boars. in addition, the presence of  genes encoding bacteriocin and virulence factors was also analysed by pcr and sequencing. production of antimicrobial activity was checked in all enterococci against 9 indicator bacteria and it was detected in 11 e. faecium isolates (16.5%); eight and two of them harboured the genes encoding enterocin a + enterocin b and enterocin l50a/b, respectively. sixty-seven per cent of our enterococci harboured different combinations of genes of the cyl operon, but none of them contained the complete cyl l(l)l(s)abm operon, necessary for cytolysin expression. the presence of gel e gene, associated with the fsr abc locus, was identified in 4 e. faecium and two e. faecalis isolates, exhibiting all of them gelatinase activity. beta -hemolytic activity was not found in our isolates. both cpd and ace genes, encoding respectively the accessory colonisation factor and pheromone, were detected in two e. faecalis isolates, and the hyl gene, encoding  hyalorunidase, in two e. faecium isolates, one of them gelatinase-positive. genes encoding bacteriocins and virulence factors are widely disseminated among faecal  enterococci of wild boars and more studies should be carried out to know the global distribution of these determinants in enterococci of different ecosystems.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == [molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates].
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and genotype of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre)faecium and faecalis isolates. methods: thirty-eight non duplicate vancomycin -resistant enterococci isolates were collected from 2003 to  2007 in beijing chaoyang hospital. the prevalence of vre was analyzed using whonet software. these strains were processed by brain heart infusion agar screening in the presence of vancomycin (6 mg/l), and were analyzed for genotypic characteristics using multiplex pcr. the homology of the isolates was determined  by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: most vre strains were isolated from the icu patients (34.2% , 13/38). the vancomycin resistance rate (vancomycin mic> or =16 mg/l) was 2.6% in 2003, 1.8% in 2004, 0.7% in 2005, 6. 8% in 2006, and 3.3% in jan - mar 2007. fifteen vancomycin-resistant enterococci faecalis isolates were identified as vanb genotype by pcr and sequencing. (the vancomycin mic ranged from 16 to 48 mg/l and the teicoplanin mic ranged from 0.38 to 0.5 mg/l). the vana gene was confirmed by pcr and sequencing in twenty-three vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vancomycin mic > or =256 kg/l, teicoplanin mic = 2-32 mg/l). twelve vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolates showed incongruence between phenotype and genotype for glycopeptides resistance (vana genotype and vanb phenotype). the pfge analysis revealed 10 different pfge types. fourteen vancomycin-resistant enterococci faecalis isolates belonged to the same clone. 21 vancomycin-resistant enterococci faecium isolates  belonged to 9 pfge types. the four most prevalent clones was a, d, e and f. conclusion: the vre strains isolated from beijing chaoyang hospital belong to vana and vanb genotypes. vancomycin -resistant enterococci faecalis is monoclonal, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci faecium is polyclonal. some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolates show incongruence between  phenotype and genotype.

TI  == peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization for hospital-acquired enterococcal bacteremia: delivering earlier effective antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == hospital-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia has been associated with increased hospital costs, length of stay, and mortality. the peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (pna fish) test for enterococcus faecalis and other enterococci (efoe) is a multicolor probe that differentiates e. faecalis from other enterococcal species within 3 h directly from blood cultures demonstrating gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains (gpcpc). a quasiexperimental study was performed over two consecutive years beginning in 2005 that identified gpcpc by conventional microbiological methods,  and in 2006 pna fish was added with a treatment algorithm developed by the antimicrobial team (amt). the primary outcome assessed was the time from blood culture draw to the implementation of effective antimicrobial therapy before and  after pna fish. the severity of illness, patient location, and empirical antimicrobial therapy were measured. a total of 224 patients with hospital-acquired enterococcal bacteremia were evaluated, with 129 in the preintervention period and 95 in the pna fish period. pna fish identified e. faecalis 3 days earlier than conventional cultures (1.1 versus 4.1 days; p < 0.001). pna fish identified enterococcus faecium a median 2.3 days earlier (1.1 versus 3.4 days; p < 0.001) and was associated with statistically significant reductions in the time to initiating effective therapy (1.3 versus 3.1 days; p <  0.001) and decreased 30-day mortality (26% versus 45%; p = 0.04). the efoe pna fish test in conjunction with an amt treatment algorithm resulted in earlier initiation of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with hospital-acquired e. faecium bacteremia.

TI  == occurrence of the structural enterocin a, p, b, l50b genes in enterococci of different origin.
AB  == enterococci are well-known producers of antimicrobial peptides--bacteriocins (enterocins) and the number of characterized enterocins has been significantly increased. recently, enterocins are of great interest for their potential as biopreservatives in food or feed while research on enterocins as alternative antimicrobials in humans and animals is only at the beginning. the present study  provides a survey about the occurrence of enterocin structural genes a, p, b, l50b in a target of 427 strains of enterococcus faecium (368) and enterococcus faecalis (59) species from different sources (animal isolates, food and feed) performed by pcr method. based on our results, 234 strains possessed one or more  enterocin structural gene(s). the genes of enterocin p and enterocin a were the most frequently detected structural genes among the pcr positive strains (170 and 155 strains, respectively). different frequency of the enterocin genes occurrence was detected in strains according to their origin; the strains from horses and silage showed the highest frequency of enterocin genes presence. all possible combinations of the tested genes occurred at least twice except the combination of the gene of enterocin b and l50b which possessed neither strain. the gene of enterocin a was exclusively detected among e. faecium strains, while the gene of  enterocin p, b, l50b were detected in strains of both species e. faecium and e. faecalis. in conclusion, a high-frequency and variability of enterocin structural genes exists among enterococci of different origin what offers a big possibility  to find effective bacteriocin-producing strains for their application in veterinary medicine.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
AB  == enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was  evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla)  and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples  analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7%  of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin,  tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more  frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.

TI  == monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs: first report of canine ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium clonal complex 17.
AB  == national surveillance programs on antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance in animals have been established in various countries but few of them  include bacteria from pets. the objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs and to search for resistance phenotypes of clinical relevance. escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. were isolated from faecal swabs obtained from 127 dogs. disk diffusion was used to measure antimicrobial susceptibility in 117 escherichia coli, 10 enterococcus faecium and 51 enterococcus faecalis of canine origin. resistance was relatively low compared with food animal species in denmark. all escherichia  coli isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. despite the low prevalence of resistance, statistical analysis of questionnaire data revealed a significant association (p=0.02) between recent antimicrobial treatment and resistance in escherichia coli. interestingly, two dogs were found to shed enterococcus faecium resistant to ampicillin. multilocus sequence typing of these isolates indicated that the two isolates belonged to sequence types associated with human nosocomial infections, and one (st-192) was genetically related to human epidemic clonal complex 17. the detection of ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium warrants further studies on the prevalence of these bacteria in dogs and on the possible implications to both animal and human health. the results suggest that distinct methods for detection and assessment of antimicrobial resistance in animals should be considered depending on the target animal species and the purposes of the study.

AB  == a collection of enterococci isolated from meat, dairy and vegetable foods from morocco including 23 enterococus faecalis and 15 enterococcus faecium isolates was studied. all isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, and gentamicin. many e. faecalis isolates were resistant to tetracycline (86.95%), followed by rifampicin (78.26% ciprofloxacin (60.87%), quinupristin/dalfopristin  (56.52%), nitrofurantoin (43.47%), levofloxacin (39.13%), erythromycin (21.73%),  streptomycin (17.39%), chloramphenicol (8.69%), vancomycin (8.69%), and teicoplanin (4.34%). e. faecium isolates showed a different antibiotic resistance profile: a high percentage were resistant to nitrofurantoin (73.33%), followed by erythromycin (66.60%), ciprofloxacin (66.66%), levofloxacin (60.00%), and rifampicin (26.66%), and only a very low percentage were resistant to tetracycline (6.66%). one isolate was resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the incidence of virulence factors was much higher among e. faecalis isolates, especially for genes encoding for sex pheromones, collagen adhesin, enterococcal  endocarditis antigen, and enterococcal surface protein. isolates with multiple factors (both antibiotic resistance and virulence traits) were also more frequent among e. faecalis isolates, in which one isolate cumulated up to 15 traits. by contrast, several isolates of e. faecium had only very few unwanted traits as compared to only two isolates in e. faecalis. the high abundance of isolates carrying virulence factors and antibiotic resistance traits suggests that the sanitary quality of foods should be improved in order to decrease the incidence of enterococci.

TI  == complete sequence of enterococcus faecium pvef3 and the detection of an omega-epsilon-zeta toxin-antitoxin module and an abc transporter.
AB  == glycopeptide resistant enterococcus faecium (gref) persists on norwegian poultry  farms despite the ban on the growth promoter avoparcin. the biological basis for  long-term persistence of avoparcin resistance is not fully understood. this study presents the complete dna sequence of the e. faecium r-plasmid pvef3 and functional studies of some plasmid-encoded traits (a toxin-antitoxin (ta) system  and an abc transporter) that may be of importance for plasmid persistence. the pvef3 (63.1 kbp), isolated from an e. faecium strain of poultry origin sampled in norway in 1999, has 71 coding sequences including the vana avoparcin/vancomycin resistance encoding gene cluster. pvef3 encodes the ta system omega-epsilon-zeta, and plasmid stability tests and transcription analysis show that omega-epsilon-zeta is functional in enterococcus faecalis ogix, although with decreasing effect over time. the predicted abc transporter was not found to confer reduced susceptibility to any of the 28 substances tested. the ta system identified in the pvef-type plasmids may contribute to vana plasmid persistence on norwegian poultry farms. however, size and compositional heterogeneity among e. faecium vana plasmids suggest that additional plasmid maintenance systems in combination with host specific factors and frequent horizontal gene transfer and  rearrangement causes the observed plasmid composition and distribution patterns.

TI  == potential of enterococci isolated from horses.
AB  == faecal samples of 122 horses (from farms in slovakia) were examined to select enterococci to study their probiotic potential for their further use as additives. each gram of faeces contained 1.0-5.0 cfu (log 10) of enterococci. of  the 43 isolates, 25 (58.1%) were identified as enterococcus faecium, 3 strains were (6.9%) enterococcus mundtii and one strain was identified as e. faecalis. fourteen isolates were not characterized further. a significant proportion of the isolates were resistant to kanamycin, vancomycin and gentamicin. low urease activity of enterococci dominated. the values of lactic acid ranged from 0.98 to  1.91 mmol/l. porcine fibronectectin and bovine lactoferrin were bound weakly by tested enterococci, while bovine fibrinogen was bound more strongly. enterococci  from horses did not bind bovine apotransferrin. the isolates adhered with the same ability to human as well as to canine mucus. at least one enterocin gene was detected among 16 analyzed isolates. ent b gene was detected in all strains tested (16, 100%), followed by the genes ent a, ent p and ent l50b. three suitable candidates-the strains of e. faecium ef 412, ef 462 and ef 491 were selected for further detail studies and possibilities to be used as additives.

TI  == probiotic potential of enterococci isolated from canine feed.
AB  == enterococci isolated from 28 different commercially available feeds (10-1000 cfu/ml) were identified and their probiotic potential was determined. species identification of 22 selected strains was performed by intergenic length-polymorphism analysis (trna-pcr); pcr products were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis. six strains were allotted to the species enterococcus  faecium, four to e. faecalis, one to e. hirae; the remaining strains were not classed. the strains were sensitive to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline and rifampicin. they were able to adhere to human as well as canine intestinal mucus. they produced lactic acid (0.99-1.04 mmol/l) and most of them were urease-positive with sufficient survival in 5 % oxgall-bile. they did not show any inhibitory activity due to antimicrobial substances. plasmid dna was detected in 8 strains, the bands responding to small molecular size (10 kbp). considering  all probiotically important properties, e. faecium strain ee3 was suggested as potential feed additive.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia: comparison of clinical features and outcome between enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background and purpose: vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. this study was conducted to clarify the clinical  features and outcome of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. methods: patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia treated at a medical center in northern taiwan between november 1998 and july 2006 were reviewed. clinical and bacteriological characteristics of enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis were compared. results: twelve patients (6 males and 6 females) were included for analyses. the mean age was 69.3 years (range, 40 to 86 years), and 8 cases (66.7%) were older than 65 years. all patients had underlying disease. two patients received total hip replacement before development of vre bacteremia. twelve patients had prior exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. ten patients had prior intensive care unit  stay and prior mechanical ventilation before vre bacteremia. all of the patients  (n = 12) had an intravascular catheter in place. bacteremia was caused by e. faecalis in 4 patients and by e. faecium in eight. the portals of entry included  urinary tract (8.3%), skin, soft tissue and bone (41.7%) and unknown sources (50.0%). e. faecium showed a higher rate of resistance to ampicillin and teicoplanin than e. faecalis (87.5% vs 0.0%, p=0.01). the 60-day mortality rate was higher in patients with e. faecium bacteremia than e. faecalis bacteremia (62.5% vs 0.0%), although statistical significance was not obtained (p=0.08). conclusions: vre bacteremia may have an impact on the mortality and morbidity of  hospitalized patients. patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant e. faecium had a grave prognosis, especially immunosuppressed patients. the prudent  use of antibiotics and strict enforcement of infection control may prevent further emergence and spread of vre.

TI  == genetic diversity of tn1546-like elements in clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == we have investigated the genetic diversity of tn1546 among 17 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolates of enterococcus faecium. most of  these multidrug-resistant strains harboured plasmids of 2 kb to >300 kb in size.  the vancomycin resistance marker vana was located on both the plasmid and the chromosomal dna. vre isolates 18 and 22 failed to amplify the orf1-ir(r) and orf2-ir(r) but contained the orf1 and orf2. vre3 failed to amplify the orf1, orf2, vanr and vans, but still yielded a larger than expected (4.4 kb vs. 2.3 kb) vansh amplicon. vre9, 10, 21 and 22 also yielded larger (5.5 kb) vansh amplicons; all others yielded 4.0 kb vansh amplicons. sequence analysis of the vansh amplicons from vre9, 10, 21 and 22 revealed the presence of is1251 between the vans and vanh genes in these isolates. the observed vansh amplicon from vre3 contained orf31, orf30 and orf29 of the plasmid prum followed by the vanhaxyz region of tn1546. translocation of tn1546 to a prum-like plasmid in vre3 resulted in the loss of its orf1, orf2, vanr and vans elements and a loss of the orf32 of  prum, leading to a unique structural arrangement of vana elements that is hitherto unknown.

TI  == improved detection of vanb2-containing enterococcus faecium with vancomycin susceptibility by etest using oxgall supplementation.
AB  == we have isolated a number of vanb-containing enterococcus faecium isolates on bile esculin screening agar containing 6 mg/liter vancomycin, which on subsequent susceptibility testing using etest have repeatedly demonstrated vancomycin mics of <or=4 mg/liter. to investigate this genotype-phenotype incongruence of "low-mic vancomycin-resistant enterococci" (lm-vre), we examined the molecular characteristics of these isolates, including the presence of the vanb operon, using pcr amplification and dna sequencing. all lm-vre isolates contained vanb associated with the transposon tn1549 and were polyclonal. sequencing of the vanb ligase gene showed no differences from the prototype vanb2. in addition, we examined supplemented media to improve phenotypic detection of these isolates. etest detection of lm-vre improved when mueller-hinton agar (mha) and brain heart infusion agar (bhia) were supplemented with 10 g/liter oxgall (mha-oxg and bhia-oxg, respectively). we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of these media to detect vancomycin resistance using vancomycin-resistant vanb-containing  e. faecium (n = 11), vancomycin-susceptible (van negative) e. faecium (n = 11), vancomycin-susceptible (van negative) e. faecalis (n = 11), and our lm-vre (n = 23) isolates. after 48 h of incubation, both mha-oxg and bhia-oxg were 100% (34/34) sensitive and 100% (22/22) specific in the identification of vancomycin resistance. these findings suggest that supplementation of mha or bhia with 10 g/liter oxgall should be considered in laboratories where vre detection protocols rely primarily on strain phenotype rather than early vanb gene detection by pcr.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates: results of the 2004-05 prospective european surveillance initiative.
AB  == objectives: telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of serious infections due to gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to provide a baseline prospective assessment of its in vitro activity against a large and diverse collection of gram-positive clinical isolates from europe and israel. methods: gram-positive clinical isolates, collected between october 2004 and december 2005 from 36 hospital laboratories in 15 countries, were tested by broth microdilution using clsi methodology. results: in total, 3206 isolates were collected. telavancin had potent activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic range < or =0.015 to 2 mg/l), independent of resistance to methicillin or to multiple drugs. telavancin had particularly strong activity against streptococcal isolates (mic range < or =0.001 to 0.5 mg/l), including penicillin-resistant and multiple drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and erythromycin non-susceptible beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. telavancin also had excellent activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l), and although its mics were elevated against vana strains (enterococcus faecalis mic(90) 8 mg/l and enterococcus faecium mic(90) 4 mg/l), its mic(90) was substantially lower than observed with available glycopeptides. conclusions: telavancin has potent in vitro activity against contemporary gram-positive clinical isolates from diverse  geographic areas in europe and israel.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from surface and ocean water.
AB  == aims: the species identification and antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined for enterococci isolated from southern california surface and ocean waters. methods and results: species identification was determined for 1413 presumptive enterococcus isolates from urban runoff, bay, ocean and sewage water  samples. the most frequently isolated species were enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. all five of these species were isolated from ocean and bay  water with a frequency ranging from 7% to 36%. enterococcus casseliflavus was the most frequently isolated species in urban runoff making up 36-65% of isolates while e. faecium was the most frequently isolated species in sewage making up 53-78% of isolates. the similar distribution of species in urban runoff and receiving water suggests that urban runoff may be the source of enterococcus. no  vancomycin or high level gentamycin resistance was detected in e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates. conclusions: enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii are the most commonly isolated enterococcus species  from urban runoff and receiving waters in southern california. significance and impact of the study: determination of the enterococcus species isolated from receiving waters and potential pollution sources may assist in determining the sources of pollution.

AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

AB  == whole-cell protein analysis was performed for differentiating 150 enterococcal isolates to the species level, which had previously been identified by extended phenotypic conventional tests. whole-cell protein profile (wcpp) showed a high degree of similarity within species and comparison between species revealed important differences in band profiles. all enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates were properly located into their corresponding species, regardless of their clinical source and susceptibility pattern. moreover, wcpp allowed relocation of some isolates that had erroneously been identified by the usual conventional scheme (i.e. two atypical arginine-negative  e. faecalis isolates). wcpp proved to be a simple method to ascertain the various enterococcal species, especially those other than e. faecalis, and may be a suitable tool for high-complexity or reference clinical laboratories.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == effects of ionophores on enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium growth in pure and  mixed ruminal culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium are gram-positive human pathogens that can live in the gastrointestinal tract of food animals. vancomycin-resistant enterococci are an increasing threat to humans as a nosocomial infection, as well as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes. ionophores are feed-grade antimicrobials that are widely used to enhance the ruminal fermentation efficiency via inhibiting gram-positive bacteria by dissipating ion and proton gradients. some bacteria can become resistant to ionophores, and this has prompted concerns about whether ionophore resistance can enhance antibiotic resistance in intestinal bacteria. since enterococci are normal members of the ruminant intestinal tract and function as an antibiotic resistance reservoir, the present study investigated whether treatment with the most commonly used ionophores affected the growth of enterococci, and whether ionophore-resistant enterococci developed. ionophores do inhibit the growth of enterococci in pure culture, but in our study did not alter populations in mixed ruminal bacterial culture. ionophore-resistant isolates were not isolated during this study from pure or mixed cultures. our results indicate that the role of ionophores in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes through the intestinal enterococcus  spp. appears to be limited.

AB  == multi-antibiotic resistant gram-positive cocci, which include staphylococcus aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococcal group, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and other streptococci, represent emerging pathogens especially in the setting of the immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, in particular when surgery, invasive procedures, or prosthetic implants are of concern, patients are admitted in intensive care units, or underlying chronic disorders and immunodeficiency are of concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics or  immunosuppressive drugs are widely administered. during the recent years, the phenomenon of multiresistant gram-positive cocci is spreading to the community, where the retrieval of such microorganism is progressively increasing. the spectrum of available antimicrobial compounds for an effective management of these relevant infections is significantly impaired in selection and clinical efficacy by the emerging and spread of methicillin-resistant and more recently glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive microbial strains. the first oxazolidinone derivative linezolid, together with the recently licensed quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, and tigecycline, followed by a number of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, and other experimental compounds on the pipeline, represent an effective response to the great majority of these concerns, due to their innovative mechanisms of action, their maintained or enhanced activity against multiresistant pathogens, their effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, their frequent possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds effective against gram-positive pathogens, and a diffuse potential for a safe and easy administration, also when  compromised patients are of concern. the main problems related to the epidemiological and clinical features of multiresistant gram-positive infection,  the potential clinical indications of all recently available compounds compared with the standard of care of treatment of resistant gram-positive infections, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of linezolid as the golden standard compound for vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci in multiple clinical situations, are outlined and updated on the ground of an extensive review of all  the available, recent evidences coming from the international literature.

TI  == unusual increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium but not enterococcus faecalis at a university hospital in taiwan.
AB  == background: enterococcal infections at the chang gung memorial hospital, taiwan,  have increased significantly in recent years, accompanied by a significant growth of vancomycin resistance from < 1% to 3.8%. however, the significant increase in  vancomycin resistance was only found in enterococcus faecium (from 0.5% to 17.4%). methods: a total of 172 patients infected with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (85 e. faecium and 87 e. faecalis) during 1998-2004 were retrospectively studied. clinical and laboratory features were analyzed using stata for windows (version 8.2). genotypes of the isolates were determined by infrequent-restriction-site polymerase chain reaction. results: multivariate analysis revealed that prior use of imipenem (odds ratio [or], 30.1; 95% confidence interval [ci], 4.2-215.9) or clindamycin (or, 6.5; 95% ci, 1.5-28.1),  positive urine cultures (or, 6.1; 95% ci, 2.1-17.8) and penicillin resistance (or, 55.9; 95% ci, 18.5-168.3) were significantly associated with the infections  caused by vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. genotyping analysis demonstrated a predominant genotype in 71 (83.5%) of the e. faecium isolates, while diverse genotypes were found among the e. faecalis isolates. no apparent correlation between genotype and any specific ward was found. up to the end of 2005, primary  efforts to restrict imipenem usage and reinforce infection control measures have  reduced by half the infections caused by vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. conclusion: multiple factors were associated with the unusual increase of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections in this hospital. continuous monitoring of appropriate antimicrobial usage and stringent compliance to infection control measures are required to control the increase of such infections.

AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == potential of houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat food with antibiotic-resistant enterococci.
AB  == it was shown previously that houseflies in fast-food restaurants commonly carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci. in this study, the potential of field-collected houseflies to contaminate ready-to-eat (rte) food with enterococci was assessed by laboratory bioassays. houseflies were collected  with a sweep net in a cattle feedlot and exposed in groups of 5, 10, 20, and 40 to a beef patty (from an rte hamburger) for 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 24 h. the exposure of rte food to flies resulted in 100% contamination with enterococci in all bioassays, regardless of the number of houseflies and the length of exposure time. in addition, with the increasing number of houseflies as well as with the increasing time exposure, the concentration of enterococci in rte food increased. even a short time exposure (0.5 h) resulted in food contamination, ranging from 3.1 x 10(3) cfu/g (5 houseflies) to 8.4 x 10(4) cfu/g (40 houseflies). the analysis of 23 randomly selected enterococcal isolates from rte food after the fly exposure revealed a single species, enterococcus faecalis. in contrast, four  enterococcus species, including e. faecalis (57.1%), e. gallinarum (19.1%), e. hirae (14.3%), and e. faecium (9.5%), represented 21 randomly selected and identified isolates from houseflies. phenotypic screening showed that e. faecalis isolates from rte food were resistant to ciprofloxacin (17.4%), tetracycline (13.0%), erythromycin (13.0%), and chloramphenicol (4.3%). this study demonstrates a great potential of houseflies from a cattle feedlot to contaminate rte food with enterococci in a short time.

TI  == comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of antimicrobial-resistant escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from the feces  of livestock and livestock farmers in japan.
AB  == seven hundred thirty-nine animal strains and 662 livestock-farmer strains, consisting of escherichia coli and enterococci, were examined for their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial-resistance patterns. two hundred fifty-eight and 203 pfge patterns were found among 739 animal strains isolated from animals comprising broilers, pigs and cattle, and 662 human strains isolated from livestock farmers, respectively, from 27 farms in japan. these results demonstrated that the pfge patterns found among e. coli and enterococci strains from animals and livestock-farmers were heterogeneous and considerably diverse. the strains having both the identical pfge pattern and the same drug-resistance pattern were defined as a single clone in this study. seven types of e. coli and enterococci clones were shared among animals within the same farms and between the different farms housing the same animal species. the 25 strains (3.4%) of 739 e. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these seven types of clones. only three types of e. coli clones were shared among animals between the different farms housing different animal species, but no identical e. faecalis or e. faecium clones were found between different animal species farms.  the 15 strains (2.0%) of 739 e. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these three types of clones. additionally, the 11 strains (1.5%) of 739 e. coli and enterococci strains isolated from animals were identical clones to strains isolated from livestock farmers of the same farm. these results suggest that the  transmission of animal clones to livestock farmers or vice versa is less common.

TI  == cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
AB  == hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79),  was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in  l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium  l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  == objectives: omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. we evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such  infections. methods: a recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin  structure infections in us medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. results: all tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/l, respectively, of omiganan. the agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/l; mic(50/90), 4 mg/l) and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/l (mic(50/90), 16 mg/l). omiganan was 16-fold more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis (mic(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/l, respectively). mic ranges and mic(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci.  omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (mic(50) values 32 mg/l), although a 4-fold increase was noted among esbl-positive klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/l, respectively). wild-type enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan mic(50/90) results (64/512 mg/l) compared with ampc-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/l). carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant p. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan mic(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/l. conclusions: at a 1% (10 000 mg/l) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all mic values, < or = 1024 mg/l), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.

TI  == characterization and susceptibility patterns of clinically important enterococcus species in eastern nepal.
AB  == life threatening infections caused by enterococcus species with multidrug resistance has emerged as a threat to medical care in the present era. this study was conducted to characterize enterococcus species isolated from different clinical samples and to detect the pattern of susceptibility to some of the commonly used antibiotics in b.p koirala institute of health sciences (bpkihs), a tertiary care hospital in eastern nepal. clinical samples submitted to the microbiology unit of central laboratory service (cls) for culture and sensitivity during march 2002 - february 2003 was analyzed. enterococcus species were identified by colony characteristics, gram staining and relevant biochemical tests. antibiotic susceptibility test was done by the kirby bauer disc diffusion  technique. of 50 enterococcus species isolated, e. faecalis was the predominant isolate (48.0%) followed by e. faecium (32.0%) and e. avium (20.0%). eighty-eight percent of e. faecalis showed sensitivity to cephotaxime and 87.0% to vancomycin. multiple drug resistance was observed most commonly in e. faecium. seventeen percent of e. faecium were resistant to vancomycin and 63.0% to ciprofloxacin and 44.0% to ampicillin. on the contrary e. avium rarely showed resistance to the antimicrobials tested including vancomycin. enterococcal infections are common nowadays specially in hospitalized patients. inappropriate use of antibiotics in  clinical practice and poultry should be discouraged to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistant species.

TI  == a "retrocidal" plasmid in enterococcus faecalis: passage and protection.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis mc4 harbors a 130 kb conjugative, pheromone (ccf10)-responding plasmid, pams1, conferring chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline resistances. a plasmid-borne class iia bacteriocin (mc4-1) determinant and cognate immunity gene were present, but not expressed in mc4. however, pams1 transfer to e. faecalis jh2-2 (but not to the non-isogenic og1ss)  generated the surprising ability to express bacteriocin activity against the plasmid donor, mc4. the bacteriocin target spectrum includes e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. those donors unable to express bacteriocin or immunity could protect themselves from the "retrocidal" behavior of transconjugants by a switch  to bacteriocin resistance at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). reversion to sensitivity occurred at a relatively high frequency, suggestive of involvement of a phase variation event. these observations concerning a conjugative plasmid with novel "retrocidal" properties, coupled with a defense mechanism independent of plasmid-borne immunity functions, may relate to phenomena exploiting regulatory features with broader ecological and evolutionary implications.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus isolates in australia, 2005: report from the australian group on antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in enterococcus species causing clinical disease was examined in a point-prevalence study in 2005. twenty-two sites around australia collected up to 100 consecutive isolates and tested them for susceptibility to ampicillin, vancomycin, high-level gentamicin and/or high-level streptomycin using standardised methods. results were compared to similar surveys conducted in 1995, 1999 and 2003. in the 2005 survey, enterococcus faecalis (1,987 strains) and e. faecium (180 strains) made up 98.6% of the 2,197 isolates tested. ampicillin resistance was common (77%) in e. faecium, but rare still in e. faecalis (0.2%). resistance to vancomycin was 7.2% in e. faecium and 0.2% in e. faecalis; the vanb gene was detected in all vancomycin-resistant isolates. high-level resistance to gentamicin was 35.8% in e. faecalis and 52.2% in e. faecium; the figures for high-level streptomycin resistance were 10.3% and 60.2%  respectively. compared to previous australian group on antimicrobial resistance surveys in 1995, 1999 and 2003, the proportions of vancomycin resistance and high-level gentamicin resistance in enterococci are increasing. it is important to have an understanding of the occurrence of vancomycin resistant enterococci and high level aminoglycoside resistance in australia to guide infection control  practices, antibiotic prescribing policies and drug regulatory decisions.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and distribution of antimicrobial-resistance genes among enterococcus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolates recovered from  poultry litter.
AB  == data on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant enterococci and staphylococci from the poultry production environment are sparse in the united states. this information is needed for science-based risk assessments of antimicrobial use in  animal husbandry and potential public-health consequences. in this study, we assessed the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci isolated from poultry litter, recovered from 24 farms across georgia, to several antimicrobials of veterinary and human health importance. among the 90 enterococcus isolates recovered, e. hirae (46%) was the most frequently encountered species, followed by e. faecium (27%), e. gallinarum (12%), and e. faecalis (10%). antimicrobial resistance was most often observed to tetracycline (96%), followed by clindamycin (90%), quinupristin-dalfopristin (62%), penicillin (53%), erythromycin (50%), nitrofurantoin (49%), and clarithromycin (48%). among the 110 staphylococci isolates recovered, only coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were identified with the predominant staphylococcus species being s. sciuri (38%), s. lentus (21%), s. xylosus (14%) and s. simulans (12%). resistance was less-frequently observed among the staphylococcus isolates for the majority of antimicrobials tested, as compared with enterococcus isolates, and was primarily limited to clarithromycin (71%), erythromycin (71%), clindamycin (48%), and tetracycline (38%). multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotypes were prevalent in both enterococcus  and staphylococcus; however, enterococcus exhibited a statistically significant difference in the median number of antimicrobials to which resistance was observed (median = 5.0) compared with staphylococcus species (median = 3.0). because resistance to several of these antimicrobials in gram-positive bacteria may be attributed to the shuttling of common drug-resistance genes, we also determined which common antimicrobial-resistance genes were present in both enterococci and staphylococci. the antimicrobial resistance genes vat(d) and erm(b) were present in enterococci, vgab in staphylococci, and mobile genetic elements tn916 and pheromone-inducible plasmids were only identified in enterococci. these data suggest that the disparity in antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes and genotypes between enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the  same environment is, in part, because of barriers preventing exchange of mobile dna elements.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of enterococcus species isolated from food in southern brazil.
AB  == enterococcus is an important group of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which inhabits  the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. these microorganisms can also be found in large groups of foods where they can play a beneficial role during food maturation processes or, conversely, can be used as a food contamination indicator. these microorganisms have an additional importance in various aspects  of clinical microbiology. the aim of this study was to investigate and determine  the phenotypic and genetic diversity in 55 enterococci isolated from different food sources. phenotypic characteristics based upon substrate hydrolysis differences were used to identify different enterococcus species. analysis of the resultant data divided these species into eight enterococcus phenotype groups. e. faecalis was the food isolate species with the greatest phenotypic variability. fifty-five previously isolated enterococcus strains were re-confirmed as belonging to this genus by pcr techniques. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd-pcr) was used to study the genetic variability using m13 primers and the resultant dna fragments produced a database of different fingerprints. after statistical analyses of the rapd-pcr profiles, 42 patterns were obtained and 6 different enterococcus rapd clusters (erc) were identified. genetic diversity was highest in erc i, which grouped together approximately 40% of the e. faecium and  e. faecalis isolates obtained from dairy products. samples isolated from meat and vegetables offered the greatest genotype variability. results of the present study suggest the presence of both phenotypic and genotypic variability within enterococci strains isolated from diverse sources of food common to southern brazil.

AB  == enterococci isolated from a bison population on a native tall-grass prairie preserve in kansas were characterized and compared to enterococci isolated from pastured cattle. the species diversity was dominated by enterococcus casseliflavus in bison (62.4%), while enterococcus hirae was the most common isolate from cattle (39.7%). enterococcus faecalis was the second most common species isolated from bison (16%). in cattle, e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium were isolated at lower percentages (3.2% and 1.6%, respectively). no resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, or high levels of vancomycin was detected from either source. tetracycline and erythromycin resistance phenotypes, encoded by teto and ermb, respectively, were common in cattle isolates (42.9% and 12.7%, respectively). a significant percentage of bison isolates (8% and 4%, respectively) were also resistant to these two antibiotics. the tetracycline resistance genes from both bison and cattle isolates resided on mobile genetic elements and showed a transfer frequency of 10(-6) per donor, whereas erythromycin resistance was not transferable. resistance to ciprofloxacin was found to be higher in enterococci from bison (14.4%) than in enterococci isolated from cattle (9.5%). the bison population can serve as a sentinel population for studying the spread and origin of antibiotic resistance.

AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci.
AB  == linezolid was approved in 2000 for treatment of gram-positive coccal infections.  we performed a case-control study during a hospital outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci (lre) infections, comparing cases of lre infection (cases) with linezolid-sensitive enterococci infections (controls). nasal and perirectal swab samples were obtained from all patients in a 1-day point-prevalence survey. we examined antimicrobial drug use and calculated the defined daily dose of linezolid per 1,000 patient-days. fifteen lre cases were identified (13 enterococcus faecalis and 2 e. faecium); 7 were vancomycin-resistant. compared with controls, case-patients had increased in-hospital mortality rates and lengths of stay. multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of lre infection: prior cultures positive for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 27), hospitalization duration before index culture (aor 1.1 per day), and duration of  preceding linezolid therapy (aor 1.1 per day). linezolid exposure and patient-to-patient transmission appear to be responsible for lre infections, an important emeraina hospital problem.

AB  == a comparative study was carried out among enterococci isolated from fruits and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples. results indicate strong differences in the numbers of enterococcal species found in different environments as well as their abundance. while enterococcus faecalis was clearly  the predominant species in clinical samples, enterococcus faecium predominated in vegetables, and it slightly outnumbered e. faecalis in water samples. other species (enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus) were found more frequently in vegetables, water, and specially in soil. isolates from vegetable foods showed a lower incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to clinical isolates for most antimicrobials tested, especially erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin for e.  faecalis, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, choramphenicol, gentamicin and nitrofurantoin for e. faecium. e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods and water showed an average lower number of antibiotic resistance traits (2.95 and 3.09 traits for vegetable  and water isolates, respectively) compared to clinical samples (7.5 traits). multi-resistant strains were also frequent among clinical e. faecalis isolates (5.46 traits on average). none of e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods, water and soil showed beta-haemolytic activity, while 25.64% of  clinical e. faecalis did. a 51.28% of e. faecalis clinical isolates tested positive for the cyla, cylb, cylm set of genes, while some or all of these genes  were missing in the rest of isolates. in clinical e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, the genetic determinants for the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp), the collagen adhesin gene (ace) and the sex pheromone gene ccf (as well as cob in e. faecalis) showed a clearly higher incidence compared to isolates from other sources. e. faecalis isolates from vegetable foods and water had much lower average numbers of virulence genetic determinants per strain (4.23 and 4.0, respectively) compared to clinical isolates (8.71). similarly, among e. faecium the lowest average number of traits per strain occurred in vegetable food isolates (1.72) followed by water (3.9) and clinical isolates (4.73). length heterogeneity (lh)-pcr typing with espf-acef-ccff and espf-ccff primers revealed  genomic groups that clearly differentiated clinical isolates from those of vegetable foods, water and soil (except for two clinical isolates). the large differences found in the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors and in the genetic fingerprints determined by lh-pcr suggest a clear separation of hospital-adapted populations of enterococci from those found in open environments.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and species composition of enterococcus spp. isolated from waters and sands of marine recreational beaches in southeastern brazil.
AB  == density, species composition and antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of the enterococcus genus were evaluated in seawater and sands from 2 marine recreational beaches with different levels of pollution. the 2 beaches showed predominance of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, in the water and  the sand. dry sand presented higher densities of enterococcus sp. and higher frequency of resistant strains than wet sand and seawater. the beach with a higher degree of pollution presented higher percentages of resistant strains (66.7% and 61.5%, in sand and in water, respectively) and resistance to a larger  number of antimicrobials compared with the less polluted beach, ilha porchat (35.7% and 31.25% of resistant strains in sand and water, respectively). in water samples, the highest frequencies of resistance were obtained against streptomycin (38.5%) and erythromycin (25%), whilst in sand, the highest frequencies were observed in relation to erythromycin and tetracycline (38.1% and 14.3%, respectively). these results show that water and sands from beaches with high indexes of faecal contamination of human origin may be potential sources of contamination by pathogens and contribute to the dissemination of bacterial resistance.

TI  == screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least  one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+  phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied  because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6  enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.

TI  == ecological characterization of the colonic microbiota of normal and diarrheic dogs.
AB  == we used terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis to assess (1) stability of the fecal microbiota in dogs living in environments characterized by varying degrees of exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota and (2) changes in the microbiota associated with acute episodes of diarrhea. results showed that the healthy canine gi tract harbors potential enteric pathogens. dogs living in an environment providing minimal exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota had similar microbiotas; the microbiotas  of dogs kept in more variable environments were more variable. substantial changes in the microbiota occurred during diarrheic episodes, including increased levels of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. when diet and medications of a dog having a previously stable microbiota were changed repeatedly, the microbiota also changed repeatedly. temporal trend analysis showed directional changes in the microbiota after perturbation, a return to the starting condition, and then fluctuating changes over time.

TI  == virulence determinants in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium vanb: clonal  distribution, prevalence and significance of esp and hyl in australian patients with haematological disorders.
AB  == european studies have suggested that the esp gene and other virulence factors have roles in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrefm) infections. the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the spectrum of clinical disease and putative virulence factors in vanb vrefm isolates. a multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify potential virulence genes (asa1, gel e, cyla, esp and hyl) in vrefm isolates obtained from an australian population of haematology patients. clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. infection, requirement for intensive care unit (icu) admission and all-cause 30-day mortality were used as clinical indicators of organism virulence. forty-one vrefm vanb isolates (41 patients; 14 infected and 27 colonised only) were analysed. thirty-five of these  isolates were typed by pfge, 31 of which were represented by three clusters. the  esp gene was identified in 22 of 27 (81.5%) screening and 11 of 14 (78.6%) infection-associated isolates. one isolate was hyl gene positive, and no isolate  contained asa1, gel e or cyla genes. vrefm infection was independently associated with host factors (underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia, age <or=60 years) but not with presence of the esp gene. icu admission was negatively associated with presence of the esp gene (or: 0.05; 95% ci: 0.01-0.61; p=0.02). there was no association between 30-day mortality and host factors or the presence of the esp gene. when compared to european and us reports, a high esp gene prevalence and low hyl gene prevalence was observed in polyclonal vre isolates obtained from this immunocompromised population.

TI  == screening for vancomycin-resistant enterococci using stools sent for clostridium  difficile cytotoxin assay is effective: results of a survey of 300 patients in a  large singapore teaching hospital.
AB  == introduction: to assess the efficacy of screening stools sent for clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay (cdta) for surveillance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). materials and methods: from april to may 2005, all stools submitted for cdta were also cultured for vre using vancomycin containing culture media. isolates were identified to species level and vancomycin resistance confirmed, followed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detection of vancomycin resistance genes and dna fingerprinting. over 2 consecutive days during that period, stool specimens or rectal swabs were also obtained from all patients in high-risk units (haematology, oncology, renal and intensive care). fifty-one patients in each group were compared in terms of vre risk factors previously identified. results and discussion: the prevalence of vre in both groups was similar [3/204 (1.5%) in the cdta arm and 1/97 (1.0%) in the high-risk arm; p = 1.0, fisher's exact test]. prevalence of risk factors for vre colonisation, including age, duration of hospitalisation, exposure to antibiotics, exposure to surgical procedures, presence of malignancy and diabetes mellitus was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). only renal failure (p < 0.05) was more common in the high-risk group. all 4 isolates of vre identified were genetically distinct by variable number tandem repeat (vntr) typing; 3 were enterococcus faecium (2 with the vanb gene, 1 with vana) and one e. faecalis. conclusion: less than 2% of our high-risk patients are vre carriers. in-hospital  vre screening using stools sent for cdta is a simple, reasonable surrogate for screening individual high-risk patients as the patient risk profile is similar and the yield comparable in a low-prevalence setting.

TI  == a nanoplex pcr assay for the rapid detection of vancomycin and bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance genes in enterococcus species.
AB  == background: enterococci have emerged as a significant cause of nosocomial infections in many parts of the world over the last decade. the most common enterococci strains present in clinical isolates are e. faecalis and e. faecium which have acquired resistant to either gentamicin or vancomycin. the conventional culture test takes 2-5 days to yield complete information of the organism and its antibiotic sensitivity pattern. hence our present study was focused on developing a nanoplex pcr assay for the rapid detection of vancomycin  and bifunctional aminoglycoside resistant enterococci (v-bia-re). this assay simultaneously detects 8 genes namely 16s rrna of enterococcus genus, ddl of e. faecalis and e. faecium, aaca-aphd that encodes high level gentamicin resistance  (hlgr), multilevel vancomycin resistant genotypes such as vana, vanb, vanc and vand and one internal control gene. results: unique and specific primer pairs were designed to amplify the 8 genes. the specificity of the primers was confirmed by dna sequencing of the nanoplex pcr products and blast analysis. the  sensitivity and specificity of v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay was evaluated against  the conventional culture method. the analytical sensitivity of the assay was found to be 1 ng at the dna level while the analytical specificity was evaluated  with 43 reference enterococci and non-enterococcal strains and was found to be 100%. the diagnostic accuracy was determined using 159 clinical specimens, which  showed that 97% of the clinical isolates belonged to e. faecalis, of which 26% showed the hlgr genotype, but none were vancomycin resistant. the presence of an  internal control in the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay helped us to rule out false negative cases. conclusion: the nanoplex pcr assay is robust and can give results within 4 hours about the 8 genes that are essential for the identification of the most common enterococcus spp. and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern. the pcr assay developed in this study can be used as an effective surveillance tool to study the prevalence of enterococci and their antibiotic resistance pattern in hospitals and farm animals.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from poultry meat and pasteurized milk in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == the enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with a remarkable capacity of  expressing resistance to several antimicrobial agents. their ubiquitous nature and resistance to adverse environmental conditions take account for their ability to colonize different habitats and for their potential for easy spreading through the food chain. in the present study we evaluated the distribution of species and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococcal isolates recovered from food obtained in retail stores in rio de janeiro, brazil. the following species were identified among 167 isolates obtained from poultry meat and 127 from pasteurized milk: enterococcus faecalis (62.6%), e. casseliflavus (17.3%), e. durans (6.5%),  e. gallinarum (3.0%), e. gilvus (2.4%), e. faecium (2.0%), e. hirae (1.4%), and e. sulfureus (1.0%). the overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates  were: 31.2 % to tetracycline, 23.8% to erythromycin, 11.3% to streptomycin, 4.3%  to chloramphenicol, 3.9% to gentamicin, 1.4% to norfloxacin, 1.1% to imipenem, 0.7% to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and penicillin, and 0.4% to ampicillin. intermediate resistance was detected in frequencies varying from 0.5% for linezolid to 58.2% for erythromycin. none of the isolates showed resistance to glycopeptides. high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in 13.1% of  the isolates. multiresistance was observed in e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. durans and e. gilvus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mupirocin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from clinical isolates in korea (1998 and 2005).
AB  == it is a hot clinical issue whether newly approved antimicrobial agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) and tigecycline are active enough to be used for infections caused by vancomycin resistant bacteria.  we performed susceptibility tests for mupirocin, which is in widespread clinical  use in korea, and four new antimicrobials, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline, against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from korean patients in 1998 and 2005 to evaluate and compare the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials. among these agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, which is rarely used in hospitals in korea, showed relatively high resistance to several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated in 2005. likewise, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline have not yet been in clinical use in korea. however, our results showed that most of the 2005 vre isolates were already resistant to linezolid and daptomycin (highest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value >100 microg/ml). compared with the other four antimicrobial agents tested in this study, tigecycline generally showed the greatest activity against vre. however, four strains of 2005 isolates exhibited resistance against tigecycline (mic >12.5 microg/ml). almost all vre were resistant to mupirocin, whereas all e. faecium isolated in 1998 were inhibited at concentrations between 0.8 to approximately 1.6 microg/ml. in conclusion, resistances to these new antimicrobial agents were  exhibited in most of vre strains even though these new antibiotics have been rarely used in korean hospitals.

TI  == biofilm formation by enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are an important global cause of nosocomial infections, being increasingly associated with urinary tract infections, endocarditis, intra-abdominal and pelvic infections, catheter-related infections, surgical wound infections, and central nervous system infections. the two most common enterococci species are enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. both are  capable of producing biofilms, which consist of a population of cells attached irreversibly on various biotic and abiotic surfaces, encased in a hydrated matrix of exopolymeric substances. many environmental and genetic factors are associated or have been proposed to be associated with the production of biofilm. this review discusses recent advances in knowledge about the biology and genetics of biofilm formation and the role of biofilms in enterococci pathogenesis.

AB  == enterococci are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. intra-abdominal and genitourinary enterococcal infections may be complicated by enterococcal bacteremia. most strains of enterococci fecal flora in antibiotic-naive patients are e. faecalis. because nearly all e. faecalis strains are sensitive to vancomycin, e. faecalis is synonymous with vancomycin-sensitive  enterococci (vse). e. faecium, which is nearly always vancomycin-resistant, is termed vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). high-grade continuous enterococcal bacteremias may result in endocarditis. persistent vse and vre bacteremias may be related to device-associated infections; intra-abdominal, pelvic, and/or renal abscesses; or enterococcal endocarditis. if these causes of persistent enterococcal bacteremia are eliminated, microbiologic and antimicrobial therapy-related causes for persistent bacteremia should be considered. we present a case of a male with a e. faecalis (vse) bacteremia unresponsive to parenteral vancomycin therapy but sensitive to vancomycin in vitro (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] = 1 microg/ml). the patient was treated with high-dose daptomycin (12 mg/kg intravenously [iv] q 24 hours) empirically pending susceptibility testing. high-dose daptomycin therapy cleared the patient's e. faecalis bacteremia. subsequently, it was determined that the strain of e. faecalis was "tolerant" of vancomycin (mic = 1 microg/ml, mbc = >64 microg/ml). we believe this is the first case of enterococcal (vse) bacteremia unresponsive to vancomycin tolerant strain of e. faecalis that responded to high-dose daptomycin (12 mg/kg iv q 24 hours) therapy.

TI  == detection of bacteriocin production and virulence traits in vancomycin-resistant  enterococci of different sources.
AB  == aim: three hundred and two enterococci were isolated from food, animal and clinical samples in order to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and bacteriocin, cytolysin, haemolysin, gelatinase production.  methods and results: among the isolates, 27 (8.9%) were vre, and 17 (63%) of these showed, by the deferred antagonism method, bacteriocin production against gram-positive and some gram-negative indicators. eight bacteriocin producers displayed by polymerase chain reaction an enterocin structural gene: six enterococcus faecium the enterocin a, two enterococcus faecalis the enterocin p genes. the enterocins as-48, 31, l50 and 1071a/b genes were not found. regarding  the virulence factors, two vre produced gelatinase and seven were haemolytic. gelatinase gele gene was found in 19 strains and cytolysin cyll(l) gene in eight. among the strains showing the cyll(l) gene, only two e. faecalis expressed a beta-haemolysis. conclusions: our results showed the persistence of vre in food,  animal and clinical samples. many of these strains displayed antibacterial activity and sometimes different components of virulence, which could emphasize their pathogenicity. significance and impact of the study: this work indicates the need of a constant monitoring of enterococci in order to assess their possible pathogenic properties. the strains of interest in the food industry or used as probiotics should be tested for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits.

TI  == emergence of clonal complex 17 enterococcus faecium in the netherlands.
AB  == the global emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium has been characterized as the clonal spread of clonal complex 17 (cc17) e. faecium. cc17 was defined upon multilocus sequence typing and is characterized by resistance to quinolones and ampicillin and the presence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) in the majority of isolates. the recently noticed increased incidence of vancomycin-susceptible cc17 e. faecium infections in our hospital initiated a nationwide study to determine ecological changes among enterococcal infections. the data and strain collections were obtained from 26 (38%) and 9 (14%) of 66 microbiology laboratories in the netherlands. e. faecium and e. faecalis were distinguished by multiplex pcr; all e. faecium isolates were genotyped by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (mlva), and the presence of esp was identified by pcr. average numbers of ampicillin-resistant enterococcal isolates from normally sterile body sites per hospital increased from 5 +/- 1 in  1994 to 25 +/- 21 in 2005. among all enterococcal bloodstream infections, the proportions of ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (aref) increased from 4% in 1994 to 20% in 2005 (p < 0.001). all e. faecalis isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, whereas 78% of the e. faecium isolates were resistant (49% of these contained esp). genotyping revealed that 86% of aref isolates belonged to cc17, including four dominant mlva types found in > or = 3 hospitals, accounting for 64% of the aref isolates. infections caused by cc17 e. faecium has increased nationwide, especially in university hospitals due to the clonal spread of four mlva types, and seems associated with acquisition of the esp gene.

TI  == consumption of camembert cheese stimulates commensal enterococci in healthy human intestinal microbiota.
AB  == enterococci are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and the main gram-positive and facultative anaerobic cocci recovered in human faeces. they are also present in a variety of fermented dairy and meat products, and some rare isolates are responsible for severe infections such as endocarditis and meningitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of camembert  cheese consumption by healthy human volunteers on the faecal enterococcal population. a highly specific real-time quantitative pcr approach was designed and used to type enterococcal species in human faeces. two species were found, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and only the enterococcus faecalis population was significantly enhanced after camembert cheese consumption, whereas escherichia coli population and the dominant microbiota remained unaffected throughout the trial.

TI  == biogenic amine-forming microbial communities in cheese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to screen two cheese starter cultures and cheese-borne  microbial communities with the potential to produce biogenic amines in cheese during ripening. bacteria of the genera enterococcus and lactobacillus and coliform bacteria were isolated from dutch-type semi-hard cheese at the beginning of the ripening period. statistically significant counts of bacterial isolates were screened for the presence of specific dna sequences coding for tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrdc) and histidine decarboxylase (hdc) enzymes. the pcr analysis of dna from 14 enterococcus and 3 lactobacillus isolates confirmed the presence of the targetted dna sequences. simultaneously, 13 tyrdc- and 3 hdc-positive isolates were grown in decarboxylase screening medium and this was followed by hplc analysis of the produced tyramine and histamine. conventional and molecular  taxonomic analyses of the above-mentioned isolates identified the following species: enterococcus durans (7 strains), enterococcus faecalis (3 strains), enterococcus faecium (1 strain), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), lactobacillus curvatus (1 strain), lactobacillus lactis (1 strain) and lactobacillus helveticus (1 strain). all of the above enterococcus and two of the lactobacillus strains originated from contaminating microbial communities. the l. helveticus strain, which was tyrosine decarboxylase-positive and exhibited tyramine production, originated from starter culture 1 used for cheese production. comparison of partial tyrdc sequences of positive enterococcus isolates revealed 89% sequence similarity, and that of hdc-positive lactobacillus isolates revealed 99% sequence similarity.

TI  == characterization of dominant lactic acid bacteria isolated from sao jorge cheese, using biochemical and ribotyping methods.
AB  == aims: to identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) present in sao jorge cheese - one of the 11 portuguese cheeses currently bearing an appellation d'origine protegee status. methods and results: a total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening  were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. the most frequently isolated species were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecalis and  enterococcus faecium. ribotyping differentiated three l. paracasei, two e. faecalis and one lactobacillus plantarum types. enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. conclusions: the dominant lab in sao jorge cheese are l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. significance and impact of the study: our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific enterococcus and lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. hence, l. paracasei and e. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of sao jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == incidence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene in human and animal fecal sources.
AB  == the occurrence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene in the opportunistic pathogens enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium is well-documented in clinical research. recently, the esp gene has been proposed as a marker of human pollution in environmental waters; however, information on its relative incidence in various human and animal fecal sources is limited. we have determined the occurrence of the esp gene in enterococci from human (n=64) and animal (n=233) fecal samples by polymerase chain reaction using two primer sets:  one presumably specific for e. faecium (esp(fm)) and the other for both e. faecalis and e. faecium (esp(fs/fm)). we believe that this research is the first  to explore the use of esp(fs/fm) for the detection of human waste in natural environmental settings. the incidence in human sources was 93.1% esp(fm) and 100% esp(fs/fm) in raw sewage influent; 30% for both esp(fm) and esp(fs/fm) in septic  waste; and 0% esp(fm) and 80% esp(fs/fm) in active pit toilets. the overall occurrence of the gene in animal feces was 7.7% (esp(fs/fm)) and 4.7% (esp(fm));  animal types with positive results included dogs (9/43, all esp(fm)), gulls (10/34, esp(fs/fm); 2/34, esp(fm)), mice (3/22, all esp(fs/fm)), and songbirds (5/55, all esp(fs/fm)). the esp gene was not detected in cat (0/34), deer (0/4),  goose (0/18), or raccoon (0/23) feces. the inconsistent occurrence, especially in septic and pit toilet sewage, suggests a low statistical power of discrimination  between animal and human sources, which means a large number of replicates should be collected. both esp(fm) and esp(fs/fm) were common in raw sewage, but neither  one efficiently differentiated between animal and other human sources.

AB  == the aim of the work was the evaluation of different pcr-based methods to found an appropriate identification and typing strategy for environmental enterococci. environmental enterococci were isolated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. species identification was provided by combination of phenotypic (micronaut system, merlin) and molecular detection methods (fluorescent its-pcr, ddl-pcr, rep-pcr, aflp). very similar results were observed among molecular methods, however several discrepancies were recognized during comparison of molecular and  biochemical identification. seven enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. hirae, e.  casseliflavus, e. mundtii, e. faecalis, e. durans and e. gallinarum) were identified within 166 environmental isolates. the results obtained in this work attest the importance of pcr-based methods for identification and typing of environmental enterococci. the fluorescent its-pcr (fits-pcr) showed the best results in order to identify the enterococci strains, the method used the automated capillary electrophoresis to separate the pcr products in a very rapid  and precise way. the aflp method was suitable to identify and characterize the isolates, while the rep-pcr can be used for species identification.

TI  == functional and structural properties of cbpa, a collagen-binding protein from arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  == arcanobacterium pyogenes, an opportunistic pathogen of economically important food animals, is the causative agent of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle, osteomyelitis in turkeys, and pneumonia and arthritis in pigs. previous studies identified the first a. pyogenes adhesin, cbpa, a protein located on the bacterial surface which has the ability to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to the host cells. the protein has an n-terminal ligand-binding region (region a) and a c-terminal repetitive domain (region b). in this study we found that cbpa bound to almost all the collagen types tested but not to other proteins, and it displayed a propensity to interact with several collagenous peptides derived by cnbr cleavage of type i and ii collagens. the k(d) values of cbpa for type i and  ii collagens and collagen peptides determined by solid-phase binding assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were in the range of 1-15 nm. it was also found that cbpa and its a region bound fibronectin, and that collagen and fibronectin interacted with distinct subsites. anti-cbpa antibodies were effective at inhibiting both binding of isolated cbpa and bacterial adhesion to immobilized collagen, suggesting that cbpa is a functional collagen-binding adhesin. analysis of the immunological cross-reactivity of cbpa with antibodies against other bacterial collagen-binding proteins indicated that cbpa is immunologically related to ace from enterococcus faecalis but not to cna from staphylococcus aureus or acm from enterococcus faecium. far-uv and near-uv circular dichroism spectra showed that full-length cbpa and its region a are mainly composed of beta-sheet with only a minor alpha-helical component and that both the proteins have a well-defined tertiary structure.

TI  == assessment of safety of enterococci isolated throughout traditional terrincho cheesemaking: virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == enterococci account for an important fraction of the adventitious microflora of traditional cheeses manufactured in mediterranean countries from small ruminants' raw milk and play an important role in the development of suitable organoleptic characteristics of the final product. it has been suggested that animals used for food or animals that supply edible products are a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci. the main purpose of this research effort was thus to identify, to the species level, a total of 73 enterococci with high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts (as prevailing environmental conditions in  the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract), which were previously isolated  from the milk feedstock to the final product of terrincho cheesemaking, and to determine their profiles of antibiotic susceptibility, coupled with the occurrence of specific virulence factors (especially in those that might eventually be claimed to exhibit suitable probiotic and technological performances). isolates, identified by both api 20 strep and pcr methods, were found to belong to the following enterococcus species: e. casseliflavus, e. durans, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum. susceptibility of those isolates was observed to most antibiotics tested, whereas none harbored aminoglycoside resistance genes. pcr screenings for cytolysin genes (cyll(l), cyll(s), cylm, cylb, and cyla), surface adhesin genes (efaa(fs), efaa(fm), and esp), the aggregation protein gene (agg), and the extracellular metalloendopeptidase gene (gele) were performed. all isolates proved negative for cyll(l), cylm, cylb, and agg genes. both e. faecalis strains were positive for the cell wall-associated protein esp and the cell wall adhesin efaa(fs), whereas  the cell wall adhesin efaa(fm) was detected in 11 of the 12 e. faecium strains. only one strain possessed the cyll(s) determinant, and another possessed the cyla gene. incidence of virulence determinants was thus very low; hence, the enterococcal adventitious microflora tested is essentially safe.

AB  == a total of 73 isolates of enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(b) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in belgium. the erm(b) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b antibiotics (mls(b)). the isolates belonged to eight different species: enterococcus avium (eight isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), enterococcus durans (seven isolates), enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and enterococcus hirae (five  isolates). acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(o) or tet(s). in three e. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(l) or tet(m) was present. the transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the tn916/tn1545 transposon  family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(m) gene. it was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(b) gene. the use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to mls(b) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans.

TI  == new antimicrobial agents as therapy for resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci have emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infections. we conducted a literature review of newer antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci. quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have in vitro activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and are superior to vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant isolates. dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin are new glycopeptides that have superior pharmacodynamic properties compared to vancomycin. we review the antibacterial spectrum, clinical indications and contraindications, pharmacologic properties, and adverse events associated with each of these agents. daptomycin has rapid bactericidal activity for staphylococcus aureus and is approved for use in bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. linezolid is comparable to vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) pneumonia and has pharmacoeconomic advantages given its oral formulation. quinupristin/dalfopristin is the drug of choice for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections but has no activity against enterococcus faecalis. tigecycline has activity against both enterococcus species and mrsa; it is also active against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes which allows for use in intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections. a review of numerous in vitro and animal model studies shows that interaction between these newer agents and other antistaphylococcal agents for s. aureus are  usually indifferent (additive).

TI  == a new chromogenic agar medium, chromid vre, to screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == we compared the performance of a chromogenic agar medium chromid vre (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) designed to recover and identify vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from clinical specimens with bile esculin azide vancomycin (beav) agar. for this study, 120 stool specimens were plated on chromid vre and beav and examined after 24 and 48 h. at 24 h, the sensitivity and specificity were as follows: beav, 90.2% and 73%, respectively; chromid vre, 86.3% and 100.0%, respectively. furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity and specificity of chromid vre for enterococcus faecium were 85.4% and 100%, respectively, and for enterococcus faecalis, 90% and 100%, respectively. we conclude that chromid vre provides an equivalent sensitivity for the recovery of  vre from stool specimens, with improved specificity, and the added advantage of providing differentiation between vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis.

TI  == enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit: associated predictors, risk factors and seasonal patterns.
AB  == background: during and shortly after birth, newborn infants are colonized with enterococci. this study analyzes predictors for early enterococcal colonization of infants in a neonatal intensive care unit and describes risk factors associated with multidrugresistant enterococci colonization and its seasonal patterns. methods: over a 12-month period, we performed a prospective epidemiological study in 274 infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.  on the first day of life, we compared infants with enterococcal isolates detected in meconium or body cultures to those without. we then tested the association of  enterococcal colonization with peripartal predictors/risk factors by using bivariate and multivariate statistical methods. results: twenty-three percent of  the infants were colonized with enterococci. the three most common enterococcal species were e. faecium (48% of isolates), e. casseliflavus (25%) and e. faecalis (13%). fifty-seven percent of the enterococci found were resistant to three of five antibiotic classes, but no vancomycin-resistant isolates were observed. during winter/spring months, the number of enterococci and multidrug-resistant enterococci were higher than in summer/fall months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001, respectively). with respect to enterococcal colonization on the first day of life, predictors were prematurity (p = 0.043) and low birth weight (p = 0.011). with respect to colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci, risk factors were prematurity (p = 0.0006), low birth weight (p < 0.0001) and prepartal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.019). using logistic regression, we determined that gestational age was the only parameter significantly correlated with multidrug-resistant enterococci colonization. no infection with enterococci or multidrugresistant enterococci in the infants was detected. the outcome of infants with and without enterococcal colonization was the same with respect to death, necrotizing enterocolitis, intracerebral hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. conclusion: in neonatal intensive care units, an infant's susceptibility to early colonization with enterococci in general, and his or her  risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci in particular, is increased in preterm newborns, especially during the winter/spring months. the prepartal use of antibiotics with no known activity against enterococci appears to increase the risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the asia/pacific rim, europe and latin and north america collected as part of test and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  == objectives: to describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in asia/pacific rim (n = 1,947), north america (n = 24,283), latin america (n = 1,957) and europe (n = 8,796). methods: isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between january 2004 and august 2006. only one isolate per patient was accepted. in vitro mics for the isolates were determined according to the clsi (formerly nccls) guidelines. results: key organisms collected were acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), escherichia coli (n = 6,504), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035)  and staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). rates of methicillin resistance among s. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in north america (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all gram-positive isolates (mic(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/l). overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the gram-negative species, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against p. aeruginosa.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among k. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in latin america (124/282, 44.0%). conclusions: tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to antimicrobial agents at different ward levels in four north european countries.
AB  == a multicentre susceptibility study was performed on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at 3 different ward levels: primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus), in denmark, finland, norway and sweden. there was a markedly higher incidence of resistance among cons in icus compared to ghws and pccs. resistance rates were low among s.  aureus isolates and no differences were found between the ward levels. oxacillin  resistance was found among 1.6% of s. aureus and 47% of cons isolates. 14% of cons and 0.9% of s. aureus isolates were glycopeptide intermediate. the prevalence of e. faecium isolates in this study differed significantly between the ward levels with the lowest prevalence found at pccs. high level gentamicin resistant (hlgr) enterococci occurred in 11-25% of e. faecium and 6-20% of e. faecalis isolates. the hlgr rate was significantly higher among e. faecalis from  hospitalized patients (ghws and icus) compared to patients at pccs. for enterococcal isolates, no other significant differences in antimicrobial resistance were found between the ward levels. all enterococci were teicoplanin susceptible, but decreased susceptibility to vancomycin was found among 2.0% and  0.6% of the e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates, respectively.

TI  == effects of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance and removal of fecal indicator bacteria in aerated and unaerated leachfield mesocosms.
AB  == antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment systems. mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the leachfield of a septic system under aerated (air) and unaerated (leach) conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg l(-1))  to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. the mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52 days. the fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to that in septic tank effluent, gammares, for e. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the  air treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the leach treatment. for fecal streptococci,  gammares ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the air and leach treatments, respectively. no significant differences in antibiotic resistance of  fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from either treatment. tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for e. coli and from 95.9 to 100% for fecal streptococci. our results suggest that short-term addition of tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leachfield soil.

TI  == a novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  == secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." the growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. it was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kda; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other gram-positive bacteria, such as l. innocua, s. aureus 209, and lactobacillus delbrueckii b2, nor against some gram-negative species, such as escherichia coli hb101.

TI  == influx of enterococci and associated antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from ready-to-eat food to the human digestive tract.
AB  == the influx of enterococcal antibiotic resistance (ar) and virulence genes from ready-to-eat food (rtef) to the human digestive tract was assessed. three rtefs (chicken salad, chicken burger, and carrot cake) were sampled from five fast-food restaurants five times in summer (su) and winter (wi). the prevalence of enterococci was significantly higher in su (92.0% of salad samples and 64.0% of burger samples) than in wi (64.0% of salad samples and 24.0% of burger samples).  the overall concentrations of enterococci during the two seasons were similar ( approximately 10(3) cfu/g); the most prevalent were enterococcus casseliflavus (41.5% of isolates) and enterococcus hirae (41.5%) in wi and enterococcus faecium (36.8%), e. casseliflavus (27.6%), and enterococcus faecalis (22.4%) in su. resistance in wi was detected primarily to tetracycline (50.8%), ciprofloxacin (13.8%), and erythromycin (4.6%). su isolates were resistant mainly to tetracycline (22.8%), erythromycin (22.1%), and kanamycin (13.0%). the most common tet gene was tet(m) (35.4% of wi isolates and 11.9% of su isolates). the prevalence of virulence genes (gele, asa1, cyla, and esp) and marker genes for clinical isolates (ef_0573, ef_0592, ef_0605, ef_1420, ef_2144, and pathogenicity island ef_0050) was low (< or =12.3%). genotyping of e. faecalis and e. faecium using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the food contamination likely originated from various sources and that it was not clonal. our conservative estimate (single ar gene copy per cell) for the influx of tet genes  alone to the human digestive tract is 3.8 x 10(5) per meal (chicken salad). this  ar gene influx is frequent because rtefs are commonly consumed and that may play  a role in the acquisition of ar determinants in the human digestive tract.

TI  == vand and vang-like gene clusters in a ruminococcus species isolated from human bowel flora.
AB  == a vancomycin-resistant, anaerobic, gram-positive coccus containing the vand and vang-like genes (strain ccri-16110) was isolated from a human fecal specimen during a hospital surveillance program to detect carriers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain ccri-16110 with databases revealed a potentially novel ruminococcus species that was most similar (<94% identity) to clostridium and ruminococcus species. strain ccri-16110 was highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin (mics of >256 microg/ml). the complete dna sequence of the vand cluster was most similar (98.2% identity) to that of enterococcus faecium bm4339, containing the vand1 allele. an intd gene with 99% identity with that of this e. faecium strain was found to be associated  with the vand gene cluster of this novel anaerobic bacterium. strain ccri-16110 also harbors genes encoding putative vans(g), vang, and vant(g) proteins displaying 56, 73.6, and 55% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, compared to the corresponding proteins encoded by the vang1 and vang2 operons of enterococcus faecalis bm4518 and n03-0233. this study reports for the first time  an anaerobic bacterium containing the vand gene cluster. this strain also harbors a partial vang-like gene cluster. the presence of vand- and vang-containing anaerobic bacteria in the human bowel flora suggests that these bacteria may serve as a reservoir for the vand and vang vancomycin resistance genes.

AB  == in vitro growth responses of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were  tested in cell-free, fat-free bovine mammary secretions. mammary secretions were  collected during the dry period, and during early, late, and extended lactation.  sixty-three enterococcal isolates from aseptically collected bovine quarter milk  samples and bedding samples from a commercial dairy herd were tested. isolates from bovine quarter milk samples originated from mammary glands with clinical mastitis, cows with composite somatic cell score >4, postpartum milk samples, or  from routine milk samples submitted to a mastitis diagnostic laboratory. source of enterococcal isolates and the species significantly contribute to the ability  of organisms to multiply in mammary secretions from various stages of lactation.  isolates collected from milk samples of the commercial herd and isolates from milk submitted to a mastitis diagnostic lab did not display enhanced growth in mammary secretions compared with isolates from bedding. growth responses of e. faecalis were greater than those for e. faecium in secretions collected during the dry period, late lactation, and extended lactation. bacterial growth did not  differ between enterococcal species in mammary secretion collected from cows in early lactation. differences in bacterial growth between e. faecalis and e. faecium in mammary secretions may indicate differences between species in susceptibility of mammary glands during the lactation cycle.

TI  == gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (gp-bsi(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. between october 2000 and september 2006, 42 episodes of gp-bsi(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, enterococcus species in 42.9% (e faecalis, eight; e faecium, seven; e avium, two; e gallinarum, one) and staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for gp-bsi (odds ratio [or], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.089 to 0.715; p = .009). thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and s aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. it is noteworthy that all the isolates of s aureus were methicillin-resistant. ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of e faecium and 50% of e avium isolates, but active against all e faecalis and e gallinarum strains. all the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. no significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. gp-bsi, the only independent risk factor for death (or, 0.262; 95% ci, 0.106 to 0.643; p = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first  year posttransplant. in conclusion, gp-bsi(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. control measures are required to reduce the incidence of gp-bsi(s) in liver transplant recipients. these findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.

TI  == enterococcus populations in pecorino abruzzese cheese: biodiversity and safety aspects.
AB  == the presence of enterococci in pecorino abruzzese cheese during ripening was evaluated. counts were high, especially in fully ripened summer batches. seventy  strains were isolated and identified based on phenotypical and genotypical features as enterococcus faecium (48.5%), enterococcus faecalis (40%), and enterococcus durans (11.5%), with the first species predominant in spring batches and the second predominant in summer batches. high biodiversity was revealed by random amplification of polymorphic dna and a pcr assay, suggesting the presence  of autochthonous strains. e. faecium isolates were the most resistant to the tested antibiotics, especially to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and penicillin,  but all strains were susceptible to vancomycin, as confirmed by the absence of vana and vanb genes. the presence of some virulence determinants was investigated, revealing the diffusion of aggregation substance (asal) and gelatinase (gele) genes in 37.5% of e. faecalis strains. however, none of the isolates produced gelatinase in vitro, suggesting the presence of silent genes. the virulence genes were absent in e. durans. among e. faecium strains, only lab  41/1 possessed gele and asal, whose presence previously has been reported only in e. faecalis. decarboxylating activity was revealed for phenylalanine (27% of the  strains) and tyrosine (96%) but not histidine. the presence of a tyrosine decarboxylase-encoding gene was observed for all strains. a comparison of these results with those of previous studies of clinical and food isolates indicates that enterococci from pecorino abruzzese cheese have low pathogenic potential.

AB  == besides staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last  few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. in both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. in  the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these gram-positive  bacteria.

AB  == the objective was to study the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated in faecal enterococci of wild boars in portugal. one hundred and thirty-four enterococci (67 e. faecium, 54 e. hirae, 2 e. faecalis, 2 e. durans and 9 enterococcus spp.) were recovered from 67 wild boars (two isolates/sample), and were further analysed. high percentages of resistance were  detected for erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin (48.5%, 44.8%, and 17.9%, respectively), and lower values were observed for high-level-kanamycin, -streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin resistance (9%, 6.7%, 4.5%, and 3.7%, respectively). no isolates showed vancomycin or high-level-gentamicin resistance. the erm(b), tet(m), aph(3')-iiia, and ant(6)-i genes were demonstrated in all erythromycin-, tetracycline-, kanamycin-, and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. specific genes of tn916/tn1545 and tn5397 transposons were detected in 78% and 47% of our tet(m)-positive enterococci, respectively. the tet(s) and tet(k) genes were detected in one isolate of e. faecium and e. hirae, respectively. three e. faecium isolates showed quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance and the vat(e) gene was found in all  of them showing the erm(b)-vat(e) linkage. four e. faecium isolates showed ampicillin-resistance and all of them presented seven amino acid substitutions in pbp5 protein (461q-->k, 470h-->q, 485m-->a, 496n-->k, 499a-->t, 525e-->d, and 629e-->v), in relation with the reference one; a serine insertion at 466' position was found in three of the isolates. faecal enterococci from wild boars harbour a variety of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes and resistant bacteria that could eventually be transmitted to other animals or even to humans.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci isolates in india.
AB  == little attention has been paid to the problem of the spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in india. between august 2002 to march 2003, faecal and urine samples of patients from various wards of the postgraduate institute of medical education and research, chandigarh, india, were screened for vancomycin resistance. 36 vre were isolated (18 enterococcus gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 7 e. faecium and 2 e. faecalis). these isolates were characterized as low-, moderate- and high-level resistant strains by phenotypic as well as genotypic methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration determination, polymerase chain  reaction assays, sequencing of pcr products and multiple sequence alignment of van genes. correlations established between these results and the vancomycin resistance markers were designated as vana (783 bp), vanb (635 bp), vanc1 (822 bp) and vanc2 (484 bp) according to the findings of earlier workers as well as comparison with existing databases. prolonged hospital stay and vancomycin were important risk factors for both vre uti and colonization. renal dialysis, renal failure, prior aminoglycoside and third generation cephalosporin were the other significant factors for vre uti. the study also highlights the importance of screening for vre in clinical samples and recommends the institution of control measures to prevent the further spread of vre.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == molecular characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolates  from mainland china.
AB  == little is known about vancomycin-resistant enterococci in china. thirteen pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-confirmed heterogeneous vana-type vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates were obtained from five  chinese hospitals from 2001 to 2005. the isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing into nine different sequence types (sts), including five new sts  (st18, st25, st78, st203, st320, st321, st322, st323, and st335). vancomycin resistance in each isolate was encoded on conjugative plasmids; two of the plasmids, pzb18 (67 kbp) and pzb22 (200 kbp), were highly conjugative and were able to transfer at high frequencies of around 10(-4) and 10(-7) per donor cell in broth mating, respectively. none of the plasmids identified in these isolates  carried traa, which is usually conserved in the pmg1-like highly conjugative plasmid for e. faecium, implying that pzb18 and pzb22 were novel types of a highly conjugative plasmid in enterococci. thirteen tn1546-like elements encoding vana-type vre on the conjugative plasmids were classified into six types (types i to vi), and most of them contained both is1216v and is1542 insertions. the isolates carrying the type ii element were predominant. the six type elements were different from that of a vana-type enterococcus faecalis strain isolated from chinese chicken meat. the results suggested that the disseminations of vre in these areas were by tn1546-like elements being acquired by the conjugative plasmids and transferred among e. faecium strains.

TI  == protein synthesis in lactic acid and pathogenic bacteria during recovery from a high pressure treatment.
AB  == recovery of injured bacteria after high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment is a key point in food safety. in this study, protein synthesis during the recovery of meat environment bacteria listeria monocytogenes ctc1011, lactobacillus sakei 23k, l. sakei ctc494, enterococcus faecalis ctc6365 and enterococcus faecium ctc6375 after a 400 mpa hhp treatment was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. after 2 h recovery from hhp treatment, the four species induced transcription factors and proteins related to protein synthesis or fate and enzymes from energy metabolism. however, several stress proteins were specifically induced in the two l. sakei strains. proteins from the general metabolism predominated in e. faecalis and e. faecium, and stress proteins and proteases predominated in l. monocytogenes. thus, each species induced a different number of proteins and displayed a specific response  which may reflect its specific fitness status.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a chinese hospital.
AB  == in investigating the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vres) in a hospital in china, 338 enterococci were detected by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. eleven vres were found, including one vana e. faecalis, one vanb  e. faecium, three vanb e. faecalis, five vanc(1) e. gallinarum, and one vanc(2 )  e. flavescens. vitek 2, microbroth dilution, and e-test were used to determine the susceptibilities of the vres to certain antimicrobial agents; multiple-drug resistance of the 11 vres was distinct. compared with phenotypic methods, multiplex pcr rapidly detected 11 vres and provided van genotype information. this is the first study that sequenced van genes of vre isolates in china to date and found type vanb in china. because of the relatively low isolating rate, early detection of vre is vital.

TI  == glycopeptide-resistant enterococci: deciphering virulence, resistance and epidemicity.
AB  == purpose of review: since their first discovery, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens first in the us, followed by the rest of the world. in this review the most recent findings that relate to enterococcal epidemiology, virulence and glycopeptide-resistance maintenance will be discussed. recent findings: frequent horizontal gene transfer and recombination, resulting in high-level genome plasticity, facilitating rapid  responsiveness of enterococci to changing environmental conditions may have contributed to the worldwide emergence. for enterococcus faecium this has resulted in the development of a distinct genetic subspecies, clonal complex 17,  responsible for the majority of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci-related hospital burden. preliminary data also suggest that such high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes may exist within enterococcus faecalis. the last 2 years have not only disclosed novel determinants implicated in enterococcal pathogenesis, but also showed that enterococci are able to sense their environment and regulate virulence gene expression accordingly. linkage of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci to plasmid maintenance systems holds a doomed perspective for controlling antibiotic resistance emergence. summary: recent developments have improved our understanding of enterococcal population structure, pathogenesis and glycopeptide-resistance maintenance. this may contribute to the development of novel intervention strategies to prevent enterococcal infections and contain the  spread of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.

TI  == predictors of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) carriage in the first major vre outbreak in singapore.
AB  == introduction: until recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) infection or colonisation was a rare occurrence in singapore. the first major vre outbreak  involving a 1500-bed tertiary care institution in march 2005 presented major challenges in infection control and came at high costs. this study evaluates the  predictors of vre carriage based on patients' clinical and demographic profiles.  materials and methods: study patients were selected from the hospital inpatient census population during the vre outbreak (aged 16 years or more). clinical information from 84 cases and 377 controls were analysed. results: significant predictors of vre carriage included: age>65 years odds ratio (or), 1.98; 95% ci (confidence interval), 1.14 to 3.43); female gender (or, 2.15; 95% ci, 1.27 to 3.65); history of diabetes mellitus (or, 1.94; 95% ci, 1.14 to 3.30), and staying in a crowded communal ward (or, 2.75; 95% ci, 1.60 to 4.74). each additional day  of recent hospital stay also posed increased risk (or, 1.03; 95% ci, 1.01 to 1.04). conclusion: elderly diabetic females with prolonged hospitalisation in crowded communal wards formed the profile that significantly predicted vre carriage in this major hospital-wide outbreak of vre in singapore. it is imperative that active vre surveillance and appropriate infection control measures be maintained in these wards to prevent future vre outbreaks.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.

TI  == model for antibiotic optimization via neoglycosylation: synthesis of liponeoglycopeptides active against vre.
AB  == the neoglycosylation of a methoxyamine-appended vancomycin aglycon with all possible n'-decanoylglucopyranose and n'-biphenoylglucopyranose regioisomers led  to the production of a focused set of liponeoglycopeptide variants in good yields and with excellent stereoselectivity. high-throughput antibacterial assays employing a unique set of vancomycin-resistant enterococci faecalis and enterococci faecium clinical isolates revealed that the nature and regiochemistry of glycosyl lipidation modulated vancomycin-resistent enterococci potency. in contrast to prior work with lipoglycopeptides, this study reveals the glucose c3' or c4' as the optimal position for neoglycopeptide lipidation. this purely chemical method for the diversification of the glycolipid portion of lipoglycopeptide antibiotics is simple to perform on a large scale, requires minimal synthetic effort in sugar donor preparation, and provides access to highly active antibiotics that are not easily prepared by other state-of-the-art  methods.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety aspects, and biotechnological potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos).
AB  == samples from the intestinal content and carcasses of mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity, presence of genes coding bacteriocins and their expression, and potential virulence factors. enterococcus faecalis comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity followed by e. faecium, e. hirae, enterococcus spp., and the non-enterococci. although all e. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of most producer cultures. however, all e. faecium isolates showed antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoded bacteriocins, although the occurrence  in the isolates of several enterocin genes did not always correlate with a higher antagonistic activity in supernatants. the efaafm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in e. faecium, while e. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and e. hirae did not carry any of the virulence genes  examined. the rapid identification of genes coding described bacteriocins permits recognition of isolates that are potentially producers of novel bacteriocins. purification of the antimicrobial activity of e. hirae dch5 and lactococcus garvieae dcc43 revealed unique chromatographic fragments after maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the antagonistic peptides were purified to homogeneity. bacteriocinogenic e. faecium and e. hirae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of bacteriocins, and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility to most clinically relevant antibiotics. however, the presence among the enterococci of e. faecalis  strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors, raises concerns regarding their potential pathogenicity to consumers.

TI  == prevalence of streptogramin resistance in enterococci from animals: identification of vatd from animal sources in the usa.
AB  == there is considerable debate over the contribution of virginiamycin use in animals to quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) resistance in humans. in this study, the prevalence and mechanisms of streptogramin resistance in enterococci from animals and the environment were investigated. from 2000-2004, enterococci from samples were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. q/d-resistant isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration >or=4 microg/ml) were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using primers for streptogramin resistance genes (ermb, msrc, vatd and vate). from the analysis, 1029/6227 (17%) q/d-resistant non-enterococcus faecalis enterococci were identified. the majority of q/d-resistant isolates were enterococcus hirae (n=349; 34%), enterococcus casseliflavus (n=271; 26%) and enterococcus faecium (n=259; 25%). using pcr, 55.5% (n=571) were positive for ermb, 3% (n=34) for msrc, 2% (n=20) for vate and  0.3% (n=3) for vatd; 39% (n=401) were negative for all four genes. the vatd-positive samples comprised two e. faecium from chicken and one e. hirae from swine. the nucleotide sequence of vatd from the three isolates was 100% homologous to published vatd sequences. these data indicate that q/d resistance among enterococci from animals remains low despite the long history of virginiamycin use. to date, this is the first report of vatd from enterococci in  animals in the usa.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacterial isolates from the asia-pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a sentry program report (2003-2004).
AB  == medical centres in eight countries in the asia-pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined for 120 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (wt) methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa)).  oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. vancomycin resistance was higher among enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. daptomycin (mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5-1mg/l) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. all tested isolates of e.  faecalis (mic(90)=2mg/l) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90)=0.5mg/l) were  susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin mic and mbc values were slightly higher for the hvisa isolates compared with wt-mrsa, with mbc/mic ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. the mbc/mic ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hvisa. in contrast, teicoplanin mbc/mic ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against gram-positive isolates collected from asia-pacific countries, including hvisa strains.

TI  == drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  == background: drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) have become recently available. we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system (bd, sparks, md). diagnostic tools included the new smic/id-2 panel for streptococci, and the pmic/id-14 for enterococci. two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 40), enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods. test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). results: streptococci: essential agreement (ea) and categorical agreement (ca) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. major (me) and minor errors (me) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. no very major errors (vme) were produced. enterococci: ea was 97%,  ca 96%. small numbers of vme (0.9%), me (1.4%) and me (2.8%) were obtained. overall, ea and ca rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium. the mean time to results (+/- sd) was 11.8  +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. conclusion: the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast. panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.

TI  == effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb10415 on cell numbers of total  enterococcus spp., e. faecium and e. faecalis in the intestine of piglets.
AB  == sows and their piglets were fed a diet supplemented with or without the probiotic e. faecium ncimb10415 (also known as sf68). piglets were sacrificed 14, 28, 35 and 56 days after birth and dna from intestinal segments was extracted and purified. a real time pcr assay was used to distinguish enterococcus spp. (16s rdna based), e. faecium (efaafm gene), e. faecalis (efaafs gene) as well as the probiotic strain (unique plasmid sequence). extracts of autoclaved sow feces inoculated with e. faecium and e. faecalis cultures were used to calibrate real time pcr results. the probiotic strain was detected in 14 day old suckling piglets before the piglets had access to the starter diet. in piglets of the probiotic group, probiotic e. faecium cell counts were always a significant proportion of total e. faecium cells in stomach digesta (4-20%), however only a small fraction of the total enterococcus spp. cell number on day 14 and 28 in all intestinal segments (0.1-0.7%). compared to control samples, the probiotic e. faecium strain significantly (p < or = 0.05) decreased the amount of total enterococcus spp. and e. faecalis cells in the colon of 14 day old suckling piglets as well as in jejunum and colon samples one week after weaning. e. faecium cell counts were not modified on any sampling day or intestinal segment.  this study showed that the presence of probiotic e. faecium ncimb10415 coincided  with reduced total e. faecalis, but not total e. faecium cell numbers in the intestine of piglets. in view of unchanged cell numbers and ratios in sow feces,  modifications must have taken place within the intestine of suckling piglets.

AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == with the incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. these compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, s. albus, streptococcus enteridis and s. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (mic: 3.13-6.25 mug/ml). the position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except s. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely s.  albus, s. enteridis.

TI  == daptomycin antimicrobial activity tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated in european medical centers (2005).
AB  == background: daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with potent activity and broad spectrum against gram-positive bacteria currently used for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia, including right sided endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro activity of this compound and selected comparator agents tested against clinical strains of staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005. methods: a total of 4,640 strains from 23 medical centers located in 10 european countries, turkey and israel (sentry program platform) were tested for susceptibility by reference  broth microdilution methods according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines and interpretative criteria. mueller-hinton broth was supplemented to 50 mg/l ca++ for testing daptomycin. results for oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed separately. results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus varied from 2.1% in sweden to 42.5% in the united kingdom (uk) and 54.7% in ireland (29.1% overall), while vancomycin resistance rates varied from 0.0% in france, sweden and switzerland to 66.7% in the uk and 71.4% in ireland among enterococcus faecium (17.9% overall). all s. aureus strains were inhibited at daptomycin mic of 1 mg/l (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and only one coagulase-negative staphylococci strain (0.1%) showed an elevated (>1 mg/l) daptomycin mic value (4 mg/l). among e. faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest daptomycin mic value was 2 mg/l; while among e. faecium  (mic50/90, 2/4 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest mic result was 4 mg/l. conclusion: daptomycin showed excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005 and resistance to oxacillin, vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin did not compromise its activity overall against these pathogens. based on these results and those of previous publications, daptomycin appears to be an excellent therapeutic option for serious infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in europe.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == occurrence of the van genes in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from clinical isolates in korea.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from korea patients in 1998 and 2005 were tested for susceptibility to nine different antimicrobial agents, including vancomycin and teicoplanin. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for the detection of several vancomycin resistance genes such as vana ('high level'), vanb ('moderate high level'), vanc1 and vanc2 ('low level'). both e. faecalis and e. faecium exhibited a resistance of 80% and more than 60% to synercid and mupirocin, respectively. moreover, an average of 76% of all isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, lincomycin, cefotaxime, and meropenem, confirming the multiple drug resistance of most of the isolates. no resistance to vancomycin or teicoplanin was observed in the 1998 e. faecalis and  e. faecium isolates. however, the 2005 e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates exhibited resistance of 16% and 12% to vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively.  in addition, vana gene was detected in 4 strains of 2005 e. faecium isolates, thus showing a high resistance to vancomycin. no other vancomycin resistance genes, including vanb, vanc1, and vanc2, were found in our isolates. in this study, we compared the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of specific resistance genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium. the results showed that  the 2005 isolates were usually more resistant than the 1998 isolates.

TI  == a new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  == the use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. a marine bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eal fish of baluchistan coast of pakistan. this strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. in this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the  cells of p. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa), salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio aliginolyticus, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter faecium but it is not active against  g streptococci, candida albicans, aspergillus niger. minimal inhibitory concentration for gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg ml(-1) and  for gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg ml(-1).

AB  == aims: to investigate the influence of avilamycin (avm) administration and its subsequent withdrawal on the emergence and disappearance of avm-resistant enterococci in the intestine of broiler chickens. methods and results: five chicks each of c, l and h groups were given the basal diet, the basal diet supplemented with 5 g avm/ton and the basal diet supplemented with 50 g avm/ton,  respectively. the avm-resistant enterococcus faecalis population did not emerge during 30 days of the avm administration period, whereas the avm-resistant enterococcus faecium with a minimum inhibitory concentration of >512 microg ml(-1) in the faeces of chicks of the l and h groups emerged on 3 and 1 days after the avm administration, respectively. thereafter, the avm-resistant ent. faecium population density in both l and h groups maintained high levels during the avm administration period. twenty days after the avm withdrawal, the avm-resistant ent. faecium population disappeared from the intestines of both four of five chicks of l group and three of five chicks of h group. the avm-resistant ent. faecium population density in one chick from each of the groups, l and h, did not change before and after the avm removal. conclusions: the avm-resistant ent. faecium emerged during the avm administration, and disappeared from the intestine of most chicks after the avm withdrawal. however,  the avm-resistant ent. faecium persisted in some chicks 20 days after avm withdrawal. significance and impact of the study: our results suggest that introducing an avm withdrawal period could minimize the risk of avm-resistant ent. faecium becoming carcass contaminants, and that prudent antibiotic use alone is not sufficient to stem emergence of the avm-resistant ent. faecium.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from north america and europe: a report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == increases in prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have been documented globally since its emergence in the 1980s. a sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2003) objective monitored vre isolates with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility trends, geographic resistance variability, and clonal dissemination. in 2003, vre isolates from north america (united states and canada, n = 839, 26 sites) and europe (n = 56, 10 sites) were susceptibility tested using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) reference methodologies. based on resistance profiles, 155 isolates displayed similar multidrug-resistant (mdr) profiles and were temporally related; these were subsequently submitted for typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). most of the submitted isolates were enterococcus faecium (91.0%) and enterococcus faecalis (7.8%). among vre, the vana phenotype was more prevalent in north america (76%) than europe (40%), and all isolates had elevated resistance rates to other antimicrobial classes including the following: 1) chloramphenicol resistance among e. faecalis being greater in north america than in europe (28.6% versus 7.1%, respectively) but reversed among e. faecium (0.5% and 15.0%, the latter due to clonal occurrences); 2) ciprofloxacin resistance in north america >99% for both species and in europe varying from 85.7% to 87.5%; 3) rare occurrences of linezolid resistance in north america (0.8% to 1.8%) due to g2576u ribosomal mutation; 4) higher quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance observed among european e. faecium strains (10.0% versus 0.6%); and 5) higher rifampin resistance rates among european e. faecalis (21.4% versus 5.4%). thirty-five mdr  epidemic clusters were identified by pfge in 21 north american and 2 european medical centers including the following: 1) vana (20 sites, 27 clonal occurrences) and vanb (1 site, 2 clonal occurrences); 2) elevated quinupristin/dalfopristin mic results (not vatd/e, 3 sites); and 3) chloramphenicol resistance (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-positive strains, 3 sites). the esp gene, part of the putative e. faecium pathogenicity island and a  marker for the clonal complex-17 lineage, was detected in 76% of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. clonal spread appears to be a dominant factor of mdr vre dissemination on both continents, and further monitoring is critical to assist in the control of these resistant pathogens.

TI  == characterizing an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci using hidden markov models.
AB  == background: antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens can arise in epidemic clusters or sporadically. genotyping is commonly used to distinguish epidemic from sporadic vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). we compare this to a statistical method to determine the transmission characteristics of vre. methods  and findings: a structured continuous-time hidden markov model (hmm) was developed. the hidden states were the number of vre-colonized patients (both detected and undetected). the input for this study was weekly point-prevalence data; 157 weeks of vre prevalence. we estimated two parameters: one to quantify the cross-transmission of vre and the other to quantify the level of vre colonization from sporadic sources. we compared the results to those obtained by  concomitant genotyping and phenotyping. we estimated that 89% of transmissions were due to ward cross-transmission while 11% were sporadic. genotyping found that 90% had identical glycopeptide resistance genes and 84% were identical or nearly identical on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). there was some evidence, based on model selection criteria, that the cross-transmission parameter changed throughout the study period. the model that allowed for a change in transmission just prior to the outbreak and again at the peak of the outbreak was superior to other models. this model estimated that cross-transmission increased at week 120 and declined after week 135, coinciding  with environmental decontamination. significance: we found that hmms can be applied to serial prevalence data to estimate the characteristics of acquisition  of nosocomial pathogens and distinguish between epidemic and sporadic acquisition. this model was able to estimate transmission parameters despite imperfect detection of the organism. the results of this model were validated against pfge and glycopeptide resistance genotype data and produced very similar  results. additionally, hmms can provide information about unobserved events such  as undetected colonization.

AB  == vana-type human (n=69), animal (n=49), and food (n=36) glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) from different geographic areas were investigated to study their possible reservoirs and transmission routes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed two small genetically related clusters, m39 (n=4) and m49 (n=13), representing enterococcus faecium isolates from animal and human  feces and from clinical and fecal human samples. multilocus sequence typing showed that both belonged to the epidemic lineage of cc17. purk allele analysis of 28 selected isolates revealed that type 1 was prevalent in human strains (8/11) and types 6 and 3 (14/15) were prevalent in poultry (animals and meat). one hundred and five of the 154 vana gre isolates, encompassing different species, origins, and pfge types, were examined for tn1546 type and location (plasmid or chromosome) and the incidence of virulence determinants. hybridization of s1- and i-ceui-digested total dna revealed a plasmid location in 98% of the isolates. human intestinal and animal e. faecium isolates bore large (>150 kb) vana plasmids. results of pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  and sequencing showed the presence of prototype tn1546 in 80% of strains and the  g-to-t mutation at position 8234 in three human intestinal and two pork e. faecium isolates. there were no significant associations (p>0.5) between tn1546 type and gre source or enterococcal species. virulence determinants were detected in all reservoirs but were significantly more frequent (p<0.02) among clinical strains. multiple determinants were found in clinical and meat enterococcus faecalis isolates. the presence of indistinguishable vana elements (mostly plasmid borne) and virulence determinants in different species and pfge-diverse populations in the presence of host-specific purk housekeeping genes suggested that all gre might be potential reservoirs of resistance determinants and virulence traits transferable to human-adapted clusters.

AB  == objectives: the study was undertaken to investigate vancomycin-resistant (vana) enterococcus faecalis isolates carrying aggregation substance (as) gene(s) for their ability to co-transfer vana and as genes. methods: six vana clumping-positive e. faecalis isolates (five human and one food sample) carrying  one or more as genes (prgb, asa1, asa373) were analysed for co-transfer of vana and as genes to e. faecalis jh2-2 and enterococcus faecium 64/3. results: e. faecalis isolates harboured one or multiple plasmids carrying vana, one or more as gene(s) or both. vana was transferred to jh2-2 (frequencies of 10(-3)-10(-6))  from all donors and to 64/3 (10(- 6)-10(- 8)) only from donors from humans. as genes were detected in 51/60 (85%) of jh2-2 and in 20/50 (40%) of 64/3 vana transconjugants (prgb, asa1, asa373 or prgb asa373), of which a total of 53.6% were clumping-positive. the plasmid content of jh2-2 transconjugants from the same donor was either identical to that of the donor or it was completely different, suggesting different mechanisms for co-transfer (location on the same  pheromone plasmid, mobilization of vana plasmids by the pheromone-inducible conjugation system, rearrangement of plasmid content during matings). after induction with pheromones, a marked increase in adhesion to caco-2 cells was observed in four isolates and in some jh2-2 transconjugants, all clumping-positive. conclusions: findings suggest that co-transfer of vana and as  genes may be a common feature of e. faecalis isolates. since as is recognized as  a virulence factor, this feature might contribute to the emergence of strains with enhanced ability to cause infection and disease in humans.

TI  == enterococci from appenzeller and schabziger raw milk cheese: antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, and persistence of particular strains in the products.
AB  == enterococci are natural residents of human and animal intestinal tracts, and grow to high numbers in a variety of cheeses. the aim of this study was to determine the diversity of enterococci in two types of artisanal raw milk cheese (schabziger and appenzeller) and to investigate whether particular strains with triple resistance against chloramphenicol (chl), tetracycline (tet), and erythromycin (ery) persist in the production system. of 46 cheese samples, a total of 312 enterococcus strains were isolated over a 5-month period on selective agar plates containing chl, tet, or, ery. enterococcus faecalis was the predominant species (80.7%), followed by enterococcus faecium (5.1%), and enterococcus durans (11.7%). according to the phenotypic resistance patterns, a selection of 150 strains was analyzed with pcr for the presence of genes encoding resistance to ery (erea, ereb, mpha, erma, ermb, ermc, mrsa/mrsb, mefa/mefe), and tet (tetm, tetl). because virulence factors have been linked to the pathogenicity of enterococci, the strain selection was also tested for the presence of the following virulence factors: agg, gele, cyl, esp, efaafs, efaafm, cpd, cob, and ccf. all tested strains contained at least two of the nine virulence genes taken  into analysis. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of the isolates showed a limited persistence of several strains over a period of 1 to 2 months in schabziger, and more than 2 months in appenzeller. finally, the enterococcal flora in the two types of cheeses seems to be rather unrelated. within 150 strains from 25 different cheese samples (11 appenzeller and 14 schabziger), 41 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns could be identified, and only 1 of these was found in enterococci from both types of cheese.

AB  == only 9 (11.2%) out of 80 studied bacterial strains were able to utilize iron saturated 2-oxo acids and hydroxyacids and grow on o-phenantroline containing media. these strains belonged to enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium species and were isolated from clinical material. iron sources utilized by all of these strains were fe(iii) complexes with pyruvic, 2-oxobutyric, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric, 2-oxo-3-methylvaleric, 2-oxoisocaproic and 2-oxoadipic acids. none of the nine strains released 2-oxoacids to environment during growth  in iron excess fe+ medium and iron deficient--fe- (chelex) medium. in fe- (phenantroline) medium, when the growth was strongly inhibited, only pyruvic acid was released. iron uptake from 59fe(iii)-pyruvate was depended on iron deficiency during growth: cells harvested from fe- (phenantroline) medium have acquired the  most amount of iron. 2,4-dinitrofenol was a strong inhibitor of 59fe(iii) iron uptake. release of pyruvic acid is not subject to negative derepression and does  not require the presense of iron as its inductor. it appears in the environment as a response to growth inhibiting stress caused by the iron deficiency but contrary to siderophores are not specially synthesized for iron assimilation. therefore, it is only primary metabolism products released by damaged, but metabolic active cells.

AB  == laspartomycin c (1), a lipopeptide antibiotic related to amphomycin, consists of  a cyclic peptide core and an aspartic acid unit external to the core and linking  this to a c15-2,3-unsaturated fatty acid. this was reported initially to be active against staphylococcus aureus, and more recent studies have shown that it  is active against vre, visa, and mrsa isolates. the enzymatic cleavage of the fatty acid tail was accomplished with a deacylase produced by actinoplanes utahensis and resulted in two peptides, designated peptide 1 and peptide 2. semisynthetic derivatives of both peptides have been made, and the principal requirement for biological activity appears to be the presence of an acylaspartic acid.

AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == specificity of l,d-transpeptidases from gram-positive bacteria producing different peptidoglycan chemotypes.
AB  == we report here the first direct assessment of the specificity of a class of peptidoglycan cross-linking enzymes, the l,d-transpeptidases, for the highly diverse structure of peptidoglycan precursors of gram-positive bacteria. the lone functionally characterized member of this new family of active site cysteine peptidases, ldt(fm) from enterococcus faecium, was previously shown to bypass the d,d-transpeptidase activity of the classical penicillin-binding proteins leading  to high level cross-resistance to glycopeptide and beta-lactam antibiotics. ldt(fm) homologues from bacillus subtilis (ldt(bs)) and e. faecalis (ldt(fs)) were found here to cross-link their cognate disaccharide-peptide subunits containing meso-diaminopimelic acid (mesodap(3)) and l-lys(3)-l-ala-l-ala at the  third position of the stem peptide, respectively, instead of l-lys(3)-d-iasn in e. faecium. ldt(fs) differed from ldt(fm) and ldt(bs) by its capacity to hydrolyze the l-lys(3)-d-ala(4) bond of tetrapeptide (l,d-carboxypeptidase activity) and pentapeptide (l,d-endopeptidase activity) stems, in addition to the common cross-linking activity. the three enzymes were specific for their cognate  acyl acceptors in the cross-linking reaction. in contrast to ldt(fs), which was also specific for its cognate acyl donor, ldt(fm) tolerated substitution of l-lys(3)-d-iasn by l-lys(3)-l-ala-l-ala. likewise, ldt(bs) tolerated substitution of mesodap(3) by l-lys(3)-d-iasn and l-lys(3)-l-ala-l-ala in the acyl donor. thus, diversification of the structure of peptidoglycan precursors associated with speciation has led to a parallel evolution of the substrate specificity of the l,d-transpeptidases affecting mainly the recognition of the acyl acceptor. blocking the assembly of the side chain could therefore be used to combat antibiotic resistance involving l,d-transpeptidases.

TI  == in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  == aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of  85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction,  showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in  the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.

TI  == effect of banning vancomycin analogue avoparcin on vancomycin-resistant enterococci in chicken farms in taiwan.
AB  == avoparcin, a vancomycin analogue, was banned as a feed additive in taiwan in 2000. a nationwide surveillance was conducted to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) on chicken farms between 2000 and 2003. among the 1021 e. faecalis and 967 e. faecium isolates studied, resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, high-level aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol either increased or remained high except vancomycin. the proportion of vre decreased, between 2000 and 2003, from 13.7% (22/161) to 3.7% (11/299) for e. faecalis, and 3.4% (4/119) to 0% (0/300) for e. faecium. only 8.8% (7/80) of the chicken farms surveyed harboured vre in 2003 compared with 25% (15/60) in 2000. all vre were resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. all vre possess the vana gene but nearly all (79 of 83 isolates) were susceptible to teicoplanin, indicating vanb phenotype. some clones were detected from different  farms in various regions over the years. we conclude that the frequency of vre in chicken farms decreased in association with a ban on avoparcin; and the continued presence of vre may be due to the ability of some strains to persist in the farms, transfer of vancomycin resistance determinants or co-selection by the continued use of other antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == prevalence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes genes among isolates of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in iran.
AB  == disks containing 120 microg of gentamicin were used to detect high-level gentamicin-resistant phenotype (hlgr) among isolates of enterococcus faecalis (n  = 79) and e. faecium (n = 35). these isolates were collected from three hospitals in tehran during 2002-2004. the macrobroth dilution assay was then used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of gentamicin. the susceptibility of isolates against amikacin, netilmicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin were also determined by kirby-bauer method. all isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays targeting aminoglycoside modifying enzyme (ames) genes including aac(6 ')-aph(2 "), aph(2 ")-ib, aph(2 ")-ic, aph(2  ")-ia, aph(2 ")-id, aph(3 ')-iiia, and ant(4 ')-ia. fifty-nine isolates (52%) showed hlgr phenotype. all isolates with hlgr phenotype and those showing 64 < mic < 500 microg/ml contained aac(6 ')-aph(2 "). the aph(3 ')-iiia was found in 61% of the isolates with hlgr phenotypes and in 65% of isolates with mic < 500. coexistence of aac(6 ')-aph(2 ") and aph(3 ')-iiia gene among hlgr isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium were 60% and 65%, respectively. the gene aph(2 ")-ic was  amplified in two isolates of e. faecium. the results of pcr for aph(2 ")-id, ant(4 ')-ia and aph(2 ")-ib genes were negative. the aac(6 ')-aph(2 ") was the most frequent gene encoding resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides followed by aph(3 ')-iiia. isolates lacking these genes were susceptible to all aminoglyocosides tested in this study.

TI  == native microbial colonization of drosophila melanogaster and its use as a model of enterococcus faecalis pathogenesis.
AB  == enterococci are commensal organisms of the gastrointestinal (gi) tracts of a broad range of mammalian and insect hosts, but they are also leading causes of nosocomial infection. little is known about the ecological role of enterococci in the gi tract consortia. to develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of drosophila. in a survey of laboratory-reared drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. among these organisms were  several species of enterococci, including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinaraum, and enterococcus durans, as well as a previously detected but uncultured enterococcus species. drosophila could be cured of enterococcal carriage by antibiotic treatment and could be reassociated  with laboratory strains. high-level colonization by a well-characterized strain expressing the enterococcal cytolysin was found to be detrimental to drosophila compared to the effect of an isogenic, noncytolytic control. the anatomical distribution of enterococci in the drosophila gi tract was determined by immunohistochemical staining of thin sections of naturally colonized and reassociated flies.

TI  == a review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

TI  == appropriateness of empiric gentamicin and vancomycin therapy for bacteremias in chronic dialysis outpatient units in the era of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == bacteremias in inpatient chronic hd units have been described, but there is little information on bacteremias in ambulatory hd units. to determine the frequency of bacteremia and pathogen distribution in ambulatory chronic hd units, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 107 bacteremias in 5 chronic ambulatory hd units over a 3 year period. the object of the study was twofold. the first objective was to determine if bacteremias in ambulatory hd setting were substantially different in frequency or type than in the inpatient hd setting. secondly, febrile patients suspected of having bacteremia in chronic hd patients  are often empirically treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. chronic hd patients require repeated and frequent venous access for hd. bacteremias are common in chronic hd patients and may be primary or secondary and are often related to venous access site infections. the distributions of bacteremia pathogens in chronic hd patients are predominantly reflective of skin flora, i.e., staphylococci and to lesser extent aerobic gram-negative bacilli. after s. aureus (msra/mssa) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons), enterococci are the next most important gram-positive pathogens in bacteremic hd patients. most strains of e. faecalis are sensitive to vancomycin and for practical purposes should be considered as vancomycin sensitive enterococci (vse). in contrast, most strains of e. faecium are resistant to vancomycin and should be considered as vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre). we retrospectively reviewed 107 patients  on chronic ambulatory hd to determine the adequacy of empiric vancomycin and gentamicin prophylaxis. we found amikacin is preferred to gentamicin and that meropenem is an effective alternate substitution for gentamicin and vancomycin combination therapy.

AB  == fifty antibiotic-resistant enterococcus strains were isolated from raw sewage of  a wastewater treatment plant and from the same sewage after trickling through a 25-cm sand column, which retained >99% of the initial population. all 50 enterococcus isolates were resistant against triple sulfa and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and none were resistant against vancomycin. most of the isolates from raw sewage were resistant to more antibiotics than the isolates from sand column effluent. one enterococcus isolate from raw sewage (no. 61) and  one enterococcus isolate from sand column effluent (no. 95) had ten antibiotic resistances each. isolate no. 95 maintained its resistances in the absence of antibiotics during the whole study. it was compared with isolate no. 70, which was one of the isolates, being resistant only against the two sulfonamides. phenotypically and biochemically, the two organisms were strains of enterococcus  faecalis. sequence analysis of partical 16s rdna allowed alignment of isolate no. 95 as a strain of enterococcus faecium and of isolate no. 70 as a strain of e. faecalis. e. faecium strain no. 95 carried at least six different plasmids, whereas for e. faecalis strain no. 70, no discrete plasmid band was seen on the gels.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. the clinical significance of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant s pneumoniae,  and multidrug-resistant s pneumoniae is discussed. the clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and e faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) infections are reviewed. differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are described.  finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of ha-mrsa and community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) infections are compared.

TI  == [study of probiotic properties of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) strain].
AB  == bacteriocinogenic culture lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) was tested according to the basic requirements to probiotic strains. the reidentification of the strain was carried out using a set of methods including pcr. it was confirmed that the strain belongs to the species l. plantarum. the studied culture expressed antagonistic activity with respect to enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. the susceptibility test to 57 antibiotics of different groups showed that the strain was resistant to oxacillin, cefepyme, lomefloxacin, polymyxin, nalidixic acid and the antifungal antibiotics. high adhesive properties of the microorganism to the human epithelial cells (medium adhesion index was 4.6-5.6; microorganism adhesion index was 4.9-5.9) were shown. obtained results allow to recommend l. plantarum g3/3(13) for the construction of probiotics.

TI  == genetic analysis of bacteriocin 43 of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a total of 636 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates obtained  between 1994 and 1999 from the medical school hospital of the university of michigan were tested for bacteriocin production. of the 277 (44%) bacteriocinogenic strains, 21 were active against e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, and listeria monocytogenes. of those 21 strains, a representative bacteriocin of strain vre82, designated bacteriocin 43, was found  to be encoded on mobilizable plasmid pdt1 (6.2 kbp). nine open reading frames (orfs), orf1 to orf9, were presented on pdt1 and were oriented in the same direction. the bacteriocin 43 locus (bac43) consists of the bacteriocin gene baca (orf1) and the immunity gene bacb (orf2). the deduced baca product is 74 amino acids in length with a putative signal peptide of 30 amino acids at the n terminus. the bacb gene encodes a deduced 95-amino-acid protein without a signal  sequence. the predicted mature baca protein (44 amino acids) showed sequence homology with the membrane-active class iia bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria  and showed 86% homology with bacteriocin 31 from e. faecalis yi717 and 98% homology with bacteriocin rc714. southern analysis with a bac43 probe of each plasmid dna from the 21 strains showed hybridization to a specific fragment corresponding to the 6.2-kbp ecori fragment, suggesting that the strains harbored the pdt1-like plasmid (6.2 kb) which encoded the bacteriocin 43-type bacteriocin. the bac43 determinant was not identified among non-vre clinical isolates.

TI  == fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy in bacteriology: towards a reference method for bacteria discrimination.
AB  == rapid and reliable discrimination among clinically relevant pathogenic organisms  is a crucial task in microbiology. microorganism resistance to antimicrobial agents increases prevalence of infections. the possibility of fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy to assess the overall molecular composition of microbial cells in a non-destructive manner is reflected in the specific spectral fingerprints highly typical for different microorganisms. with the objective of using ft-ir spectroscopy for discrimination between diverse microbial species and strains on a routine basis, a wide range of chemometrics techniques need to be applied. still a major issue in using ft-ir for successful bacteria characterization is the method for spectra pre-processing. we analyzed different  spectra pre-processing methods and their impact on the reduction of spectral variability and on the increase of robustness of chemometrics models. different types of the enterococcus faecium bacterial strain were classified according to chromosomal dna restriction patterns produced by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). samples were collected from human patients. collected ft-ir spectra were  used to verify if the same classification was obtained. in order to further optimize bacteria classification we investigated whether a selected combination of the most discriminative spectral regions could improve results. two different  variable selection methods (genetic algorithms (gas) and bootstrapping) were investigated and their relative merit for bacteria classification is reported by  comparing with results obtained using the entire spectra. discriminant partial least-squares (di-pls) models based on corrected spectra showed improved predictive ability up to 40% when compared to equivalent models using the entire  spectral range. the uncertainty in estimating scores was reduced by about 50% when compared to models with all wavelengths. spectral ranges with relevant chemical information for enterococcus faecium bacteria discrimination were outlined.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) isolates in a  polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in new york. s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus species, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. for vrsa isolates, vancomycin mics ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. vrsa isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the vana gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in vrsa and e. faecium isolates from the biofilm. plasmid analysis revealed that the vrsa isolate acquired the 100-kb e. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the mrsa plasmid. the tetracycline resistance genes tet(u) and tet(s), not previously detected in s. aureus isolates, were identified in the vrsa isolates. additional resistance elements in the vrsa isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermb-aade-sat4-apha-3, msra (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-ia. multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and  enterococci, including vana, tet(s), and tet(u), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. the potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.

TI  == high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in korea: a konsar program in 2004.
AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of high-dose daptomycin with and without coadministration of gentamicin against isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus species.
AB  == the purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (sbts) of daptomycin alone and in combination with gentamicin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococci to determine if there might be any benefit to the addition of the aminoglycoside. a multiple-dose, randomized crossover study was performed in 11 healthy volunteers to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of 6 mg/kg of body weight daptomycin once daily with or without 1 mg/kg gentamicin every 8 h. sbts were determined against  clinical isolates of nosocomial (mrsa 494) and community-acquired (ca-mrsa 44) methicillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (vsef 49452), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref 80), and quality control strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (atcc 29213) and vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis (atcc 29212). enhancement of bactericidal activity was evaluated by calculating and comparing the areas under the bactericidal curve (aubc) for each dosing regimen against each isolate. the area  under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h and clearance for daptomycin alone were 645 +/- 91 microg.h/ml and 9.47 +/- 1.4 mg/h/kg, respectively, compared with 642 +/- 69 microg.h/ml and 9.45 +/- 1.0 mg/h/kg for daptomycin plus gentamicin. daptomycin alone displayed sustained bactericidal activity against five of the six isolates over the entire 24-h dosing interval; bactericidal activity was maintained for 8 h against vref 80. mean aubcs for daptomycin alone  ranged from 935 to 1,263 and 36 to 238 against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, respectively, compared with 902 to 972 and 34 to 213 against staphylococci and enterococci when coadministered with gentamicin. the results of this study suggest that the addition of gentamicin does not alter the pharmacokinetic profile or enhance the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against staphylococcal or enterococcal isolates.

TI  == in vitro development of resistance to dx-619 and other quinolones in enterococci.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the molecular events involved in the development of quinolone resistance in enterococci. methods: clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were exposed to inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations of dx-619, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. mutational frequencies were calculated and susceptibility changes were determined. the quinolone resistance determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra and parc in less-susceptible mutants were amplified by pcr and sequenced. results: single-step mutants of e. faecalis and e. faecium were selected with all drugs. there were no differences in the frequencies of mutant selection among drugs, with frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-8). all single-step mutants were inhibited by 0.03-1 mg/l dx-619, 0.25-8 mg/l moxifloxacin, 0.5-8 mg/l gatifloxacin, 1-16 mg/l levofloxacin and 1-32 mg/l ciprofloxacin. no qrdr changes were observed in single-step mutants. less-susceptible mutants selected after five passages on agar containing subinhibitory quinolone concentrations were inhibited by 0.12-8 mg/l dx-619, 1-64 mg/l moxifloxacin, 2-64 mg/l gatifloxacin and 2-128 mg/l levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. qrdr changes were detected in only 9 of the 20 fifth-passage mutants, suggesting that mutations outside the purported qrdrs and/or other resistance mechanisms were also involved. conclusion: the relatively high frequencies at which single-step mutants were selected with all drugs indicate that caution is necessary if quinolones are to be considered for monotherapy of serious enterococcal infections. dx-619, the most potent quinolone, may have potential as an anti-enterococcal agent if sufficient concentrations can be safely attained in vivo.

TI  == resistance of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs to gastrointestinal tract and antagonistic effect against escherichia coli k88.
AB  == the intestinal flora plays an important role in health and wellbeing of different organisms. indigenous microflora can be innocuous or pathogenic. consumption of food supplemented with beneficial microorganisms as probiotics provides a good health state and this can be maintained and recovered. currently, probiotic strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are widely used in humans as well as animals. swine industry would benefit with the application of probiotics, mainly  to overcome diarrheal diseases produced by different causes, as a pathogenic e. coli k88. the aim of this work was to isolate strains of enterococcus from gastrointestinal tract of pigs to use them as probiotic. two strains of e. faecalis, 2 of e. mundii and 7 of e. faecium were isolated with characteristics of resistance to acid ph, tolerance to biliary salts and a high antagonistic activity (>80%) against e. coli k88. based on their characteristics and species affinity, we believe that these strains could be administered to pigs as a probiotic.

TI  == evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time pcr applied to the total dna of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  == in order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for taqman real-time rcr on dna of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and dna  background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rdna targets. primer/probe assays for real-time pcr (taqman) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, meca, and taxon-specific 23s rdna sequences for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. the amplification of their gene targets in dna extracts of wastewater ("wastewater dna") and reference strains ("reference dna") was compared with their amplification in "model dna" which was composed of wastewater dna and reference dna. target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. for the detection of  the resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, and meca as well as the enterococci directed pcr only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater dna matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. the taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of p. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. for the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to p. aeruginosa a sybr green assay was employed. competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. with the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of p. aeruginosa in wastewater dna.

TI  == activity and expression of a virulence factor, gelatinase, in dairy enterococci.
AB  == in order to understand the virulence potential of dairy enterococci, 35 isolates  from raw ewe's milk and traditionally fermented cheeses, identified as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus dispar and enterococcus hirae, were screened for their capacity to produce gelatinase and for the presence of the genes gele, spre, fsra, fsrb and fsrc. studies correlating gelatinase production with maintenance and subculture of the  isolates in the laboratory environment, and growth in different media were performed. these studies were conducted with two dairy isolates identified as e.  faecalis and e. durans, and one clinical isolate, e. faecalis og1-10. rt-pcr was  used for detection of transcripts of the above mentioned genes. results demonstrated that the virulence factor gelatinase is disseminated among the genus enterococcus and that dairy isolates are capable of producing gelatinase at comparable levels with clinical isolates, although this capacity is easily lost during conservation by freezing in the laboratory. therefore, gelatinase production potential of dairy enterococci may be underestimated. the gene gele was present in all studied isolates. the same was observed for the fsr operon, either complete or incomplete, revealing that the gelatinase genetic determinants, so far only described in e. faecalis, are a common trait in the genus. this work describes for the first time the detection of the complete fsr-gele operon in other species than e. faecalis, namely e. faecium and e. durans. the loss of expression of this virulence factor under laboratory culture  conditions correlated with the loss of one or more genes of the regulatory fsr operon, although the gene gele was maintained, demonstrating that a complete fsr  operon is required for a positive gele phenotype. independent of the detection of any gelatinase activity, if both gele and the complete fsr operon are present in  the cell, all genes are transcribed, as revealed by rt-pcr, suggesting that regulation of gelatinase activity can also be post-transcriptional. the silent behavior of gele was only observed in e. faecalis, but not in e. durans, suggesting different modulation mechanisms of gelatinase activity in these two species. overall, these findings reopen the issue of food safety of enterococci and reinforce the need to further study the mechanisms responsible for triggering the virulence factor gelatinase in non-pathogenic enterococcal environmental isolates.

TI  == a field study of the microbiological quality of fresh produce of domestic and mexican origin.
AB  == produce is responsible for an increasingly larger proportion of foodborne disease outbreaks. in particular, the globalization of the food supply may introduce new  food safety risks and allow widespread distribution of contaminated food, particularly produce. the objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the overall quality of domestic and mexican produce throughout the packing process; (ii) examine changes in microbiological quality of both domestic and mexican produce at each stage of production and processing; and (iii) evaluate the prevalence of select pathogens on fresh produce, including leafy green, herbs, melons, and vegetables. furthermore, we also sought to characterize the antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis  strains isolated from fresh produce. a total of 466 produce and matching environmental swab samples was collected from various locations in packing sheds  in the southern us from november 2002 through december 2003. these samples were assayed by enumerative tests for total aerobic bacteria (apc), total coliforms, total enterococcus, and e. coli. produce samples were also analyzed for the presence of salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, shigella, and e. coli o157:h7. a  total of 112 e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates were further screened for antibiotic resistance using a panel of seventeen antibiotics. overall, the microbiological quality of fresh produce ranged from 4.0 to 7.9 log(10) cfu/g (apc); less than 1.0 log(10) to 4.5 log(10) cfu/g (coliforms); less than 1.0 log(10) to 4.0 log(10) cfu/g (e. coli); and less than 1.0 log(10) to 5.4 log(10)  cfu/g (enterococcus). no salmonella, shigella, or e. coli o157:h7 were detected from the 466 25-g produce samples tested. however, three domestic cabbage samples were found to be positive for l. monocytogenes. of the enterococcus isolates, e.  faecium had a higher degree of resistance to antibiotics in general, while enterococcus spp. isolated from mexican produce had a higher degree of antibiotic resistance when compared to strains isolated from produce samples of domestic origin. despite increased attention to the role of imported produce in foodborne  disease, this study does not support the assumption that domestic produce is of higher microbial quality than mexican produce.

AB  == the locations of the genetic determinants for enterocin l50 (entl50a and entl50b), enterocin q (entq), and enterocin p (entp) in the multiple bacteriocin  producer enterococcus faecium strain l50 were determined. these bacteriocin genes occur at different locations; entl50ab (encoding entl50a and entl50b) are on the  50-kb plasmid pciz1, entqa (encoding entq) is on the 7.4-kb plasmid pciz2, and entp (encoding entp) is on the chromosome. the complete nucleotide sequence of pciz2 was determined to be 7,383 bp long and contains 10 putative open reading frames (orfs) organized in three distinct regions. the first region contains three orfs: entqa preceded by two divergently oriented genes, entqb and entqc. entqb shows high levels of similarity to bacterial atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, while entqc displays no significant similarity to any known protein. the second region encompasses four orfs (orf4 to orf7), and orf4 and orf5 display high levels of similarity to mobilization proteins from e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis. in addition, features resembling a transfer origin region (orit) were found in the promoter area of orf4. the third region contains  three orfs (orf8 to orf10), and orf8 and orf9 exhibit similarity to the replication initiator protein repe from e. faecalis and to repb proteins, respectively. to clarify the minimum requirement for entq synthesis, we subcloned and heterologously expressed a 2,371-bp fragment from pciz2 that encompasses only the entqa, entqb, and entqc genes in lactobacillus sakei, and we demonstrated that this fragment is sufficient for entq production. moreover, we also obtained  experimental results indicating that entqb is involved in abc transporter-mediated entq secretion, while entqc confers immunity to this bacteriocin.

TI  == expression of virulence-related genes by enterococcus faecalis in response to different environments.
AB  == enterococci are ubiquitous organisms used to both improve the flavor and texture  of fermented foods, and provide protective mechanisms as either a probiotic or antimicrobial additive. however, two species, e. faecalis and e. faecium, are also associated with 10% of nosocomial infections of the bloodstream, wounds, urinary tract and heart. while the genes involved in the pathogenicity of these organisms are slowly identified along with the mechanisms behind their regulation, the environmental signals involved in the conversion to pathogenicity remain unclear. the distribution of virulence genes was determined in 13 e. faecalis isolates from medical, food and animal sources. regardless of their source of isolation, all isolates harbored between eight and thirteen virulence genes. relative differences in expression of the virulence associated genes clpp, clpx, gls24, agg, efaa, gele, and cylbl(l) were examined in e. faecalis tmw 2.63  and tmw 2.622 exposed to different environments (lb, bhi, respective supernatants, pig fecal extract, lb+6.5% nacl, lb+ph5, lb+6.5% nacl+ph5, and sausage medium) using rt-pcr and lightcycler technology. significant differences  in expression were influenced by growth phase, environment, and isolate, which suggests that these three factors be taken into consideration during the selection of enterococci for use in foods or as probiotics rather than their source of isolation or set of virulence genes.

AB  == background: enterococci are the third leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi). vancomycin resistant enterococci are common and provide treatment challenges; however questions remain about vre's pathogenicity and its  direct clinical impact. this study analyzed the inflammatory response of enterococcal bsi, contrasting infections from vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible isolates. methods: we performed a historical cohort study  on 50 adults with enterococcal bsi to evaluate the associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and mortality. we examined sirs scores 2 days prior through 14 days after the first positive blood culture. vancomycin resistant (n = 17) and susceptible infections (n = 33) were compared. variables significant in univariate analysis were entered into a logistic regression model  to determine the affect on mortality. results: 60% of bsi were caused by e. faecalis and 34% by e. faecium. 34% of the isolates were vancomycin resistant. mean apache ii (a2) score on the day of bsi was 16. appropriate antimicrobials were begun within 24 hours in 52%. septic shock occurred in 62% and severe sepsis in an additional 18%. incidence of organ failure was as follows: respiratory 42%, renal 48%, hematologic 44%, hepatic 26%. crude mortality was 48%. progression to  septic shock was associated with death (or 14.9, p < .001). there was no difference in a2 scores on days -2, -1 and 0 between the vre and vse groups. maximal sir (severe sepsis, septic shock or death) was seen on day 2 for vse bsi  vs. day 8 for vre. no significant difference was noted in the incidence of organ  failure, 7-day or overall mortality between the two groups. univariate analysis revealed that ap2>18 at bsi onset, and respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hematologic and hepatic failure were associated with death, but time to appropriate therapy >24 hours, age, and infection due to vre were not. multivariate analysis revealed that hematologic (or 8.4, p = .025) and cardiovascular failure (or 7.5, p = 032) independently predicted death. conclusion: in patients with enterococcal bsi, (1) the incidence of septic shock  and organ failure is high, (2) patients with vre bsi are not more acutely ill prior to infection than those with vse bsi, and (3) the development of hematologic or cardiovascular failure independently predicts death.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among faecal enterococci from healthy individuals in portugal.
AB  == analysis of 247 faecal enterococcal isolates from 99 healthy portuguese individuals during 2001 revealed the presence of enterococci resistant to vancomycin (5%) and highly resistant to streptomycin (52%), kanamycin (40%) or gentamicin (11%). most isolates were also resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. the vana (two tn1546 types), vanc1, erm(b), aac(6')-aph(2'')-ia, aph(3')-iiia, vat(e) and vat(d) genes were detected. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin were related to portuguese poultry isolates described previously. e. faecium isolates that were highly resistant to vancomycin or gentamicin harboured different housekeeping purk alleles associated previously with different hosts.

TI  == safety and potential risks of enterococci isolated from traditional fermented capers.
AB  == a collection of 17 enterococci isolates obtained from fermentations of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) were investigated for incidence of known virulence determinants, antibiotic resistance and production of biogenic amines. molecular  identification revealed the presence of enterococcus faecium (nine isolates), enterococcus faecalis (4), e. avium (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens (1). alpha-haemolytic activity was detected in two e. avium and one e. faecalis isolates, and beta-haemolytic activity was detected in e. casseliflavus/flavescens. the haemolytic component cylb was detected by pcr amplification in three non-haemolytic isolates and in e. casseliflavus/flavescens. the collagen adhesin ace gene and the endocarditis associated antigen gene efaa(fm) were detected in two isolates each. genes encoding sex pheromone precursors (cpd, cob, ccf) were detected in e. faecalis and e. casseliflavus/flavescens. other presumed virulence genes (agg, gele, cylm, cyla and efaa(fs)) were not detected. all isolates were resistant to rifampicin,  erythromycin and ciprofloxacin, and some were also resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin. vancomycin resistance was not detected. tyrosine decarboxylation was detected in all e. faecium isolates. given the high resistance of enterococci to environmental conditions, and their implication in opportunistic infections, the incidence of potential virulent enterococci in foods (especially those of a higher risk-like home-made foods) should be carefully studied.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == the clinical impact of linezolid susceptibility reporting in patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == linezolid remains a mainstay of therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vres), but resistance has emerged. we describe a cohort of 20 patients with linezolid-intermediate or resistant vre (lirvre) reported by etest and disk diffusion testing, 18 of whom demonstrated linezolid susceptibility by agar dilution on further investigation. patients with reported lirvre were matched based on culture site and enterococcal species to patients with linezolid-susceptible vre (lsvre) in a 1:3 ratio. patients with reported lirvre developed more nosocomial infections (p = .04), had more central lines placed (p  = .04), and underwent more computed tomography scans related to vre infection (p  = .02). multivariate analysis revealed increased surgical procedures related to vre infections (p = .008), increased linezolid use during hospital stay (p = .03), and delayed culture and susceptibility results compared with those with lsvre (p = .006). therefore, inaccurate detection and reporting of lirvre by disk diffusion and etest is associated with increased patient morbidity and resource use.

TI  == immunochemical characterization of polysaccharide antigens from six clinical strains of enterococci.
AB  == background: enterococci have become major nosocomial pathogens due to their intrinsic and acquired resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. their increasing drug resistance prompts us to search for prominent antigens to develop vaccines against enterococci. given the success of polysaccharide-based vaccines  against various bacterial pathogens, we isolated and characterized the immunochemical properties of polysaccharide antigens from five strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. results: we cultured large batches of each strain, isolated sufficient quantities of polysaccharides, analyzed their chemical structures, and compared their antigenic specificity. three classes of polysaccharides were isolated from each strain, including a polyglucan, a teichoic acid, and a heteroglycan composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, mannosamine, and glucosamine. the polyglucans from all six strains are identical and appear to be dextran. yields of the teichoic acids were generally low. the most abundant polysaccharides are the heteroglycans. the six heteroglycans are structurally different as evidenced by nmr spectroscopy. they also differ in their antigenic specificities as revealed by competitive elisa. the heteroglycans are not immunogenic by themselves but conjugation to protein carriers significantly enhanced their ability to induce antibodies. conclusion: the six clinical strains of enterococci express abundant, strain-specific cell-surface heteroglycans. these polysaccharides may provide a molecular basis for serological typing of enterococcal strains and antigens for the development of vaccines against multi-drug resistant enterococci.

AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the species distribution and antibiotic resistance of enterococci with a special view for vancomycin resistance, isolated from stool and rectal swab samples of cattle farmers and cattles in denizli region, turkey. all the specimens were inoculated onto enterococcosel agar plate  and into enterococcosel broth supplemented with and without vancomycin (6 microg/ml). the agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, while broth cultures were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. enterococcus spp. were isolated from 96 (86.4%) of 111 farmers' and 65 (90.2%) of 72 cattles' specimens. the most commonly isolated species from both humans and animals were e. faecalis (39.6% and %32.3%, respectively), e. faecium (28.1% and 24.6%, respectively) and e. raffinosus (8.3% and 13.8%, respectively). none of the isolates were found to be resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. one high-level streptomycin (300 microg) resistant e. faecium, and six (2 e. faecalis, 2 e. durans, 2 e. hirae) high-level gentamicin (120 microg) resistant strains have been isolated from the specimens of cattle farmers and cattles, respectively. there was no significant difference between the rectal swabs and stool specimens  for the isolation of enterococcus spp. (p>0.05). enterococcosel broth was found to be more sensitive than enterococcosel agar for the isolation of enterococcus spp. (p=0.001). it was concluded that the lack of vancomycin resistant enterococci may be related to the prohibition of avoparcin use in our country.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == ecology of antibiotic resistance genes: characterization of enterococci from houseflies collected in food settings.
AB  == in this project, enterococci from the digestive tracts of 260 houseflies (musca domestica l.) collected from five restaurants were characterized. houseflies frequently (97% of the flies were positive) carried enterococci (mean, 3.1 x 10(3) cfu/fly). using multiplex pcr, 205 of 355 randomly selected enterococcal isolates were identified and characterized. the majority of these isolates were enterococcus faecalis (88.2%); in addition, 6.8% were e. faecium, and 4.9% were e. casseliflavus. e. faecalis isolates were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline (66.3%), erythromycin (23.8%), streptomycin (11.6%), ciprofloxacin (9.9%), and kanamycin (8.3%). tetracycline resistance in e. faecalis was encoded  by tet(m) (65.8%), tet(o) (1.7%), and tet(w) (0.8%). the majority (78.3%) of the  erythromycin-resistant e. faecalis isolates carried erm(b). the conjugative transposon tn916 and members of the tn916/tn1545 family were detected in 30.2% and 34.6% of the identified isolates, respectively. e. faecalis carried virulence genes, including a gelatinase gene (gele; 70.7%), an aggregation substance gene (asa1; 33.2%), an enterococcus surface protein gene (esp; 8.8%), and a cytolysin  gene (cyla; 8.8%). phenotypic assays showed that 91.4% of the isolates with the gele gene were gelatinolytic and that 46.7% of the isolates with the asa1 gene aggregated. all isolates with the cyla gene were hemolytic on human blood. this study showed that houseflies in food-handling and -serving facilities carry antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent enterococci that have the capacity  for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria.

TI  == characterization of the ends and target site of a novel tetracycline resistance-encoding conjugative transposon from enterococcus faecium 664.1h1.
AB  == enterococcus faecium 664.1h1 is multiply antibiotic resistant and mercury resistant. in this study, the genetic support for the tetracycline resistance of  e. faecium 664.1h1 was characterized. the tet(s) gene is responsible for tetracycline resistance, and this gene is located on the chromosome of e. faecium 664.1h1, on a novel conjugative transposon. the element is transferable to enterococcus faecalis, where it integrates into a specific site. the element was  designated efctn1. the integrase of efctn1 is related to the integrase proteins found on staphylococcal pathogenicity islands. we show that the transposon is flanked by an 18-bp direct repeat, a copy of which is also present at the target  site and at the joint of a circular form, and we propose a mechanism of insertion and excision.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the united states, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are of particular concern. in the united states, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by mrsa, and percentages continue to rise. outbreaks of hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are typically the result of clonal spread by mrsa being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. ha-mrsa strains are generally multidrug resistant. vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious mrsa infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant s aureus (vrsa) have recently emerged in the united states. community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) is also increasing. soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of ca-mrsa, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. the mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa, but susceptibilities to non-beta-lactam antibiotics often differ. ca-mrsa exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does ha-mrsa. the proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to enterococcus faecium. clonal  spread of vre has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. the relations between antibiotic use and vre colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [status and drug resistance surveillance of enterococcus infection in patients with severe hepatitis].
AB  == objective: to analyze the infection status and the drug resistance of enterococci in patients with severe hepatitis to guide future treatment. methods: all bacteria from infected patients with severe hepatitis were cultured with bact/alert120 automation instrument (aksu) and identified with vitek-ams60 (biomerieux). drug sensitivities of the isolated enterococci were tested with 11  antibacterial agents. results: among the 112 isolated enterococci, enterococcus faecalis was the most preponderant bacterium, and the second was e. faecium. their isolation rates were 79.5% and 14.3%, respectively. 57.1% of all the enterococci were found in the ascetic fluid of patients with severe hepatitis. fifty-eight (51.8%) isolated enterococci were found to be high level aminoglycoside resistant (hlar), 19 (17.0%) enterococci were ampicillin-resistant enterococcus (are) and 7 (6.3%) were both hlar and are. the susceptive rates of the enterococci to vancomycin and teicoplanin were very high, namely 96.4% and 100%, respectively. no vancomycin or teicoplanin resistant enterococci were found, but 4 enterococci were mildly sensitive to vancomycin. conclusion: enterococcus faecalis is the most prevalent species isolated in severe hepatitis  patients infected with enterococcal infection. from our study, vancomycin and teicoplanin are the drugs of first choice to treat those infections.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic study of gelatinase and beta-haemolysis activities in faecal enterococci of poultry in portugal.
AB  == the detection of gelatinase and beta-haemolysis activities was carried out in 83  faecal enterococci (43 enterococcus faecalis, 33 e. faecium, five e. durans and two e. hirae) of poultry origin. in addition, the presence of genes of the gele-fsrabc locus and of the cyl operon (cyll(l), cyll(s), cyla, cylb and cylm) were studied by polymerase chain reaction and correlated with gelatinase and beta-haemolysis production, respectively. most of our e. faecalis isolates were gelatinase-positive (88%), being this activity not frequent in the other enterococcal species (2.5%). only one of the 33 e. faecium isolates showed a positive gelatinase reaction. all enterococci that showed gelatinase activity harboured the gele and fsrabc genes, although these genes were also detected in four e. faecalis and one e. durans gelatinase-negative isolates. most of our non-e. faecalis gelatinase-negative isolates did not harbour gele-fsrabc genes. a high proportion of faecal enterococci of poultry origin harboured genes of the cyl operon (71%), although only 7% contained the five cyl tested genes (all of them e. faecalis). only one isolate of our series could express beta-haemolysis,  harbouring the whole cyl operon. the cyll(s) genotype was the most prevalent in our enterococci (39%) and also the most prevalent among our e. faecalis isolates  (60%). other genotypes detected were the following ones (% of enterococci): cyla  + cylb + cylm (13%), cyll(l) + cyla (4%), cyll(l) (4%), cyll(l) + cyla + cylb + cylm (2%), cyll(l) + cyla + cylm (1%) and cyla + cylm (1%). both phenotypic and genotypic assays are important to evaluate the virulence potential of enterococci.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == identification and characterization of enterococci from bryndza cheese.
AB  == aims: to identify enterococci isolated from sheep milk cheese--bryndza, and to compare differences in the composition of enterococcal microflora affected by the season, and to evaluate the potential presence of vancomycin resistance and virulence determinants. methods and results: bacterial strains were isolated during analysis of bryndza cheese and identified on the genus and species level by phenotypic methods and with commercial biochemical sets. the identification of the species, enterococcus faecium, ent. durans and ent. faecalis, was confirmed by pcr using species-specific primers for ddl genes. pcr was also used for assessment of presence of vana and vanb genes and virulence determinants gele, agg and cytolysin genes namely: cyll(l), cyll(s), cylm, cylb and cyla. among 308  enterococcus sp. strains, 177 isolates were proved to be ent. faecium, 59 to be ent. durans and 41 to be ent. faecalis. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. agar plate testing confirmed their absence. gene gele, however, was found in 20 ent. faecalis isolates, but only 13 of them showed gelatinase-positive phenotype. seven isolates had five cytolysin genes, but none  of the isolates exhibited a positive haemolytic phenotype. four isolates possessed the agg gene. the prevalence of ent. faecium species was highest in samples from the winter season harvest. conclusions: ent. faecium is the dominant enterococcal species in bryndza cheese and the most prevalent in the winter season product. none of the enterococcus sp. strains was proved to have vana or vanb genes and the vancomycin resistance. significance and impact of the study: to our knowledge, this is the first report of enterococcal microflora in bryndza  cheese and its evaluation for the presence of vana and vanb genes as well as virulence determinants.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

AB  == aims: to characterize bacteriocin production, antimicrobial spectrum and plasmid  content in bacteriocinogenic enterococci from foods. methods and results: bacteriocinogenic enterococcus faecium (14 isolates) and enterococcus faecalis (three isolates) showed two different patterns of bacteriocin production in liquid broth: exponential-phase and stationary-phase production. bacteriocin concentrates from all enterococci were inactivated by trypsin, but seldom by heat (100-117 degrees c), extremes of ph (2.0 to 9.0) or reducing agents (such as dithiothreitol). all bacteriocin concentrates were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes, and most were also active against many ent. faecalis and ent. faecium isolates. enterococci clustered in three main groups according to their plasmid content (which included plasmids from 2.0 to 53 kb). several isolates from different foods showed almost identical plasmid profiles. the enterocin p structural gene (entp) was detected by hybridization on plasmids  of c. 19, 26 and/or 35-38 kb. conclusions: enterococci from food show different patterns of bacteriocin production and different plasmid content in spite of carrying similar bacteriocin-encoding genes. significance and impact of the study: this study provides information on the diversity of bacteriocinogenic enterococci from food sources carrying apparently similar enterocin genes.

TI  == identification of tn5397-like and tn916-like transposons and diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) in enterococci from humans, pigs and poultry.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the sequence diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) and its location on mobile elements in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from humans, pigs and poultry in denmark. methods: a total  of 76 isolates were screened for tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like transposons using pcr. tet(m) was sequenced in 15 of the isolates and compared with tet(m) sequences submitted to genbank (phylogenetic analysis and signs of recombination). plasmids were extracted, filter-mating experiments were performed and tn5397-like transposons were further characterized in selected isolates. results: in 8 of 13 isolates of e. faecium from broilers, tet(m) was present on tn5397-like transposons, whereas tet(m) was predominantly associated with tn916/tn1545-like transposons in e. faecium from pigs and humans, as well as in e. faecalis from humans, pigs and broilers (50 of 63 isolates). the tet(m) genes  were divided into three major subgroups according to the phylogenetic analysis. subgroup i consisted of tet(m) from clostridium difficile and e. faecium associated with tn5397-like elements, subgroup ii consisted of tet(m) located on  tn916/tn1545 family transposons and subgroup iii consisted of tet(m) associated with composite elements containing several resistance genes. we found evidence of recombination both within and between these groups. moreover, we identified an e. faecium isolate with both tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like elements. conclusions: this study showed that enterococci contain diverse tet(m) genes present on different mobile elements, which may suggest that enterococci play an  important role in the evolution and horizontal spread of mobile elements carrying tet(m). this is the first report of tn5397-like elements in enterococci.

TI  == characterisation and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from enterococci isolated from food.
AB  == the genetic determinants responsible for the resistances against the antibiotics  tetracycline [tet(m), tet(o), tet(s), tet(k) and tet(l)], erythromycin (erma,b,c; mefa,e; msra/b; and erea,b) and chloramphenicol (cat) of 38 antibiotic-resistant  enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains from food were characterised. in addition, the transferability of resistance genes was also assessed using filter mating assays. the tet(l) determinant was the most commonly detected among tetracycline-resistant enterococci (94% of the strains), followed  by the tet(m) gene, which occurred in 63.0% of the strains. tet(k) occurred in 56.0% of the resistant strains, while genes for tet(o) and tet(s) could not be detected. the integrase gene of the tn916-1545 family of transposons was present  in 81.3% of the tetracycline resistant strains, indicating that resistance genes  might be transferable by transposons. all chloramphenicol-resistant strains carried a cat gene. 81.8% of the erythromycin-resistant strains carried the ermb  gene. two (9.5%) of the 21 erythromycin-resistant strains, which did not contain  erma,b,c, erea,b and mpha genes harboured the msrc gene encoding an erythromycin  efflux pump, which was confirmed by sequencing the pcr amplicon. in addition, all e. faecium strains contained the msrc gene, but none of the e. faecalis strains.  transfer of the genetic determinants for antibiotic resistance could only be demonstrated in one filter mating experiment, where both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were transferred from e. faecalis fair-e 315 to the e. faecalis og1x recipient strain. our results show the presence of various types of resistance genes as well as transposon integrase genes associated with transferable resistances in enterococci, indicating a potential for gene transfer in the food  environment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcal isolates from southern region of brazil.
AB  == in the present study, a total of 455 enterococcal isolates, recovered from patients living in the city of porto alegre, state of rio grande do sul, brazil,  during the period from july 1996 to june 1997, were identified to the species level by conventional biochemical and microbiological tests, and assayed for their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. the genetic diversity of antimicrobial resistant strains was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis of smai restricted chromosomal dna. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (92.8%). other species identified were: e. faecium (2.9%),  e. gallinarum (1.5%), e. avium (1.1%), e. hirae (0.7%), e. casseliflavus (0.4%),  e. durans (0.4%) and e. raffinosus (0.2%). the overall prevalence of isolates with high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides was 37.8%. hlr to gentamicin  was found in 24.8%. no strains with acquired resistance to vancomycin were found. pfge analysis showed the predominance of clonal group a, comprising strains isolated from different clinical specimens obtained from patients in three hospitals. these results suggest intra and inter-hospital dissemination of one predominant clonal group of e. faecalis isolates with hlr to gentamicin in the hospitals included in this study.

TI  == genes encoding bacteriocins and their expression and potential virulence factors  of enterococci isolated from wood pigeons (columba palumbus).
AB  == samples of the intestinal content and carcasses of wood pigeons (columba palumbus) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity. enterococcus faecium comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity, followed by enterococcusfaecalis and enterococcus columbae. pcr amplification of genes coding bacteriocins and determination of their nucleotide  sequence, and the use of specific antipeptide bacteriocin antibodies and a noncompetitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, permitted characterization of enterococci coding that described bacteriocins and their expression. the efaafm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in e. faecium, whereas e. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and e. columbae did not carry any of the virulence genes examined. although all e. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of producer cells. purification of the antagonistic activity of e. columbae plch2 showed multiple chromatographic fragments after matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the active peptide(s) had not yet purified to homogeneity. bacteriocinogenic e. faecium and e. columbae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of enterocins and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility of most relevant clinical antibiotics. however, the presence among the enterococci of e.  faecalis strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors is an issue that must be considered further.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

TI  == aslfm, the d-aspartate ligase responsible for the addition of d-aspartic acid onto the peptidoglycan precursor of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == d-aspartate ligase has remained the last unidentified peptide bond-forming enzyme in the peptidoglycan assembly pathway of gram-positive bacteria. here we show that a two-gene cluster of enterococcus faecium encodes aspartate racemase (racfm) and ligase (aslfm) for incorporation of d-asp into the side chain of the  peptidoglycan precursor. aslfm was identified as a new member of the atp-grasp protein superfamily, which includes a diverse set of enzymes catalyzing atp-dependent carboxylate-amine ligation reactions. aslfm specifically ligated the beta-carboxylate of d-asp to the epsilon-amino group of l-lys in the nucleotide precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide. d-iso-asparagine was not a substrate of aslfm, indicating that the presence of this amino acid in the peptidoglycan of e. faecium results from amidation of the alpha-carboxyl of d-asp after its addition to the precursor. heterospecific expression of the genes encoding racfm and aslfm in enterococcus faecalis led to production of stem peptides substituted by d-asp instead of l-ala2, providing evidence for the in vivo specificity and function of these enzymes. strikingly, sequencing of the cross-bridges revealed that substitution of l-ala2 by d-asp is tolerated by the d,d-transpeptidase activity of the penicillin-binding proteins both in the acceptor and in the donor substrates. the aslfm ligase appears as an attractive target for the development of narrow spectrum antibiotics active against multiresistant e. faecium.

TI  == beta-nitrostyrene derivatives as potential antibacterial agents: a structure-property-activity relationship study.
AB  == a multidisciplinary project was developed, combining the synthesis of a series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives and the determination of their physicochemical parameters (redox potentials, partition coefficients), to the evaluation of the corresponding antibacterial activity. a complete conformational analysis was also performed, in order to get relevant structural information. subsequently, a structure-property-activity (spar) approach was applied, through linear regression analysis, aiming at obtaining a putative correlation between the physicochemical parameters of the compounds investigated and their antibacterial  activity (both against standard strains and clinical isolates). the beta-nitrostyrene compounds displayed a lower activity towards all the tested bacteria relative to the beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene analogues. this was observed particularly for the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene (ivb) against the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium). the spar results revealed the existence of a  clear correlation between the redox potentials and the antibacterial activity of  the series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives under study.

TI  == transfer of vancomycin resistance transposon tn1549 from clostridium symbiosum to enterococcus spp. in the gut of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the vancomycin resistance vanb2 gene cluster is disseminated worldwide and has been found in phylogenetically remote bacterial genera. the vanb2 operon is part  of conjugative transposons tn1549/tn5382, but conjugative transposition of these  elements has not been demonstrated. we have obtained transfer of a tn1549-like element (referred to herein as "tn1549-like") from clostridium symbiosum mlg101 to enterococcus faecium 64/3 and enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice and to e. faecium 64/3 in vitro. retransfer of tn1549-like from an e. faecium transconjugant also containing tn916 to e. faecium bm77 was obtained in vitro, albeit at a very low frequency. transfer efficiency was found to be both donor and recipient dependent. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of total smai-digested dna of 48 transconjugants indicated in 27 instances the acquisition of ca. 34 kb of dna. two transconjugants harbored two copies of the transposon. sequencing of the flanking regions of tn1549-like in 48 transconjugants revealed 29 integration events in 26 loci in the e. faecium genome, and two hot spots for insertion were identified. integration of the transposon was associated with the acquisition of 5 (n = 18) or 6 (n = 7) bp of donor dna or with 5-bp duplications of target dna in the remaining transconjugants. these data demonstrate functionality of the tn1549-like element and attest that the transfer of the vanb operon between enterococci and human commensal anaerobes occurs in the intestinal environment.

TI  == heterologous expression of glycopeptide resistance vanhax gene clusters from soil bacteria in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to determine whether glycopeptide resistance gene clusters from soil bacteria could be heterologously expressed in enterococcus faecalis and adapt to the new host following exposure to vancomycin. methods: the vanhax clusters from paenibacillus thiaminolyticus pt-2b1, paenibacillus apiarius pa-b2b and amycolatopsis coloradensis dsm 44225 were separately cloned in an appropriately constructed shuttle vector containing the two-component regulatory system (vanrs) of tn1546. the complete vana(pt) operon (vanrshaxy) from p. thiaminolyticus pt-2b1 was cloned in the same shuttle vector  lacking enterococcal vanrs. all plasmid constructs were electroporated into e. faecalis jh2-2 and the mics of vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined for each recombinant strain before and following exposure to sublethal concentrations of vancomycin. results: the vanhax clusters from p. thiaminolyticus and p. apiarius conferred high-level vancomycin resistance (mic > or = 125 mg/l) in e. faecalis jh2-2. in contrast, cloning of the vanhax cluster from a. coloradensis did not result in a significant increase of vancomycin resistance (mic = 0.7 mg/l). resistance to vancomycin was not observed after cloning the complete vana(pt) operon from p. thiaminolyticus (mic = 2 mg/l), but this recombinant rapidly adapted to high concentrations of vancomycin (mic = 500 mg/l) following exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of this antibiotic. conclusion: the results showed that vana(pt) in p. thiaminolyticus is a possible ancestor of vana-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. experimental evidence supported the hypothesis that enterococci did not acquire glycopeptide resistance directly from glycopeptide-producing organisms such as a. coloradensis.

TI  == use of competitive dna hybridization to identify differences in the genomes of bacteria.
AB  == although recent technological advances in dna sequencing and computational biology now allow scientists to compare entire microbial genomes, comparisons of  closely related bacterial species and individual isolates by whole-genome sequencing approaches remains prohibitively expensive for most laboratories. here we report the development and testing of a biochemical approach for targeted sequencing of only those chromosomal regions that differ between two dna preparations. the method, designated gfe (genome fragment enrichment) uses competitive solution hybridization and positive selection to obtain genomic dna fragments that are present in one pool of fragments but not another. repeated comparisons of the genomes of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium led to the identification of 225 putative genome-specific dna fragments. species and strain  variations within these fragments were confirmed by both experimental and bioinformatic analyses. the e. faecalis genome-specific sequences identified included both a preponderance of those predicted to encode surface-exposed proteins, as well as several previously described unique marker regions embedded  within highly conserved rrn operons. the gfe strategy we describe efficiently identified genomic differences between two enterococcal genomes, and will be widely applicable for studying genetic variation among closely related bacterial  species.

TI  == measurement of ampicillin, vancomycin, linezolid and gentamicin activity against  enterococcal biofilms.
AB  == background: enterococci frequently cause biofilm infections but susceptibility of clinical isolates growing in biofilms has not been investigated. the minimum biofilm eradicating concentration (mbec) has been suggested as a guide to treatment of biofilm infections. we measured an alternative endpoint, the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) and compared the results with mic and mbc. objectives: to compare the mic, mbc and mbic of ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid against enterococcal biofilms, to assess the impact of additional gentamicin and correlate findings with clinical outcome. methods: mic and mbc were measured using standard techniques. mbics were measured using a modification of the calgary biofilm device method. fifty-eight enterococcal isolates from episodes of intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection were tested. results: tolerance to ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid was seen in 93%, 100%  and 93% of isolates, respectively. mic(90)s of ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid were all 4 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis isolates. mbc(90)s of ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid for e. faecalis isolates were 1024, >128 and 2048 mg/l, respectively. mbic(90)s of ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid for e. faecalis isolates were 8192, 4096 and 4096 mg/l, respectively. results for enterococcus faecium were similar for vancomycin and linezolid but this species was generally more resistant to ampicillin. adding 10 mg/l gentamicin had a variable effect on mic, mbc or mbic, which was not predictable by gentamicin susceptibility on disc testing. conclusions: very high concentrations of ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid are required to inhibit enterococcal biofilms in vitro. combining these agents with gentamicin significantly reduced mic, mbc and mbic against only a proportion of enterococcal isolates. no correlation between mbic and outcome was found.

TI  == comparative study of vana gene transfer from enterococcus faecium to enterococcus faecalis and to enterococcus faecium in the intestine of mice.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci represent a large reservoir in animals because of the use of avoparcin as a growth promoter in europe. these strains of animal origin enter the food chain and can either colonize the human gut or transfer their resistance genes to the human microbiota. in this study, we compared the transfer of vancomycin resistance from resistant animal enterococcus faecium to sensitive human enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. we analysed these transfers in dibiotic mice and human faecal flora-associated mice. vana transfer from animal e. faecium to human e. faecalis occurred in dibiotic mice. the transconjugants appeared rapidly and persisted at levels between 3.0 and 4.0 log10 colony-forming units g(-1) of faeces. in human faecal flora-associated mice, vana gene transfer was not detected towards e. faecalis but was possible between e. faecium strains. our experiments revealed the possibility of vana transfer from animal e. faecium to human e. faecalis in vitro and in vivo in the  intestine of dibiotic mice. however, intraspecies transfer of vana gene seems more common than interspecies transfer among enterococci.

AB  == following the identification of two clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from intensive care unit (icu) patients, a surveillance programme detected that six of eight icu patients were colonised by vre. standard epidemic control measures were instituted in the icu. during a 16-month period, 13 (2.5%) of 509 icu patients had vre-positive swabs upon admission, and 43 (8.7%) of 496 vre-negative patients were colonised by vre in the icu. patients who acquired vre in the icu had a longer icu stay (p < 0.0001). no other statistically significant differences were demonstrated. two patients had documented infection (infection/colonisation index, 3.6%; overall vre infection frequency, 0.4%), but both recovered and were discharged. vre colonisation did not increase the mortality rate. automated ribotyping identified three clusters containing, respectively, the first 52 enterococcus faecium isolates, two enterococcus faecalis isolates, and two further isolates of e. faecium. multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that two e. faecium isolates representative of the two ribotypes belonged to sequence types 78 and 18, and that these two isolates belonged to the epidemic lineage c1, which includes isolates with a wide circulation in northern italy. the outbreak was controlled by continuous implementation of the infection control programme, and by the opening of a new unit with an improved structural design and hand-washing facilities.

AB  == the o acetylation of peptidoglycan occurs specifically at the c-6 hydroxyl group  of muramoyl residues. using a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography-based organic acid analysis and carbohydrate analysis by high-ph anion-exchange chromatography, we determined that strains of entercoccus durans,  e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. hirae produce o-acetylated peptidoglycan. the levels of o acetylation ranged from 19% to 72% relative to the muramic acid content, and they were found to vary with the growth phase of the culture. increases of 10 to 40% in o acetylation were observed with cultures entering the  stationary phase. cells of e. faecalis in the viable but nonculturable (vbnc) state had the highest levels of peptidoglycan o acetylation. the presence of this modification to peptidoglycan was shown to inhibit the action of hen egg white lysozyme in a concentration-dependent manner. zymography using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels containing either o-acetylated or chemically de-o-acetylated peptidoglycan was used to monitor the production of specific autolysins in e. faecalis. differences in the expression of specific autolysins were observed with the age of the culture, and vbnc e. faecalis produced the highest levels of these enzymes. this technique also permitted classification of the enterococcal autolysins into enzymes that preferentially hydrolyze either o-acetylated or non-o-acetylated peptidoglycan and enzymes that  show no apparent preference for either substrate type.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of enterococci and related bacteria in an urban wastewater  treatment plant.
AB  == the main objective of this work was to study the ecology of enterococci and related bacteria in raw and treated wastewater from a treatment plant receiving domestic and pretreated industrial effluents in order to assess the influence of  treatment on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes among this group  of bacteria. the predominant species found in the raw wastewater were entercoccus hirae, entercoccus faecium and entercoccus faecalis. wastewater treatment led to  a reduction in e. hirae (alpha<0.1) and an increase in e. faecium (alpha<0.1); the relative proportions of e. faecalis remained the same in the raw and in the treated wastewater. among the isolates tested, no vancomycin resistance was observed among the enterococci. entercoccus faecium and e. faecalis showed resistance prevalence values reaching 33%, 40% and 57% for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively. antibiotic-resistant  strains of enterococci were not eliminated by wastewater treatment. a positive selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterococci was indicated by a significant increase in resistance prevalence (alpha<0.02) in treated wastewater compared with the raw wastewater.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes associated with non-enterococcus faecalis, non-enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == objectives: to compare risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes in patients  with enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus mundtii bacteremia (cases) with those in patients with enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (controls). design: a retrospective case-control study. setting: a 725-bed, university-affiliated, academic medical center. patients: the clinical microbiology database at northwestern memorial hospital from january 1994 to may 2003 was searched to identify cases; each case was matched to one control on the basis of date of admission. results: thirty-three cases were identified and matched with 33 controls. the mean duration of hospital stay was longer (29.7 vs 17.2 days; p = .03) and the mean time to acquisition of bacteremia was greater (16.5 vs 6.3 days; p = .003) for cases than controls. cases were more likely to have underlying hematologic malignancies (p < .001), to have been treated with corticosteroids (p = .02), and to be neutropenic (p = .003). controls were more likely to have an indwelling bladder catheter (p = .01), and cases were more likely to have the gastrointestinal tract as a source of infection (p = .007) and to have concurrent cholangitis (p = .002). there were no differences in severity  of illness or in mortality rates. conclusions: compared with patients with e. faecalis bacteremia, patients with non-e. faecalis, non-enterococcus faecium enterococcal bacteremia were more likely to have a hematologic malignancy, prior  treatment with corticosteroids, neutropenia, and cholangitis; longer duration of  hospital stay was also identified as a clinical feature. however, non-e. faecalis, non-e. faecium species are not associated with any differences in mortality.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == construction of improved temperature-sensitive and mobilizable vectors and their  use for constructing mutations in the adhesin-encoding acm gene of poorly transformable clinical enterococcus faecium strains.
AB  == inactivation by allelic exchange in clinical isolates of the emerging nosocomial  pathogen enterococcus faecium has been hindered by lack of efficient tools, and,  in this study, transformation of clinical isolates was found to be particularly problematic. for this reason, a vector for allelic replacement (ptex5500ts) was constructed that includes (i) the pwv01-based gram-positive repats replication region, which is known to confer a high degree of temperature intolerance, (ii) escherichia coli orir from puc18, (iii) two extended multiple-cloning sites located upstream and downstream of one of the marker genes for efficient cloning  of flanking regions for double-crossover mutagenesis, (iv) transcriptional terminator sites to terminate undesired readthrough, and (v) a synthetic extended promoter region containing the cat gene for allelic exchange and a high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2'')-id, to distinguish double-crossover recombination, both of which are functional in gram-positive and gram-negative backgrounds. to demonstrate the functionality of this vector, the vector was used to construct an acm (encoding an adhesin to collagen from e. faecium) deletion mutant of a poorly transformable multidrug-resistant e. faecium endocarditis isolate, tx0082. the acm-deleted strain, tx6051 (tx0082deltaacm), was shown to lack acm on its surface, which resulted in the abolishment of the collagen adherence phenotype observed in tx0082. a mobilizable derivative (ptex5501ts) that contains orit of tn916 to facilitate conjugative transfer from the transformable e. faecalis strain jh2sm::tn916 to e. faecium was also constructed. using this vector, the acm gene of a nonelectroporable e. faecium wound isolate was successfully interrupted. thus, ptex5500ts and its mobilizable derivative demonstrated their roles as important tools by helping to create the first reported allelic replacement in e. faecium; the constructed this acm deletion mutant will be useful for assessing the role of acm in e. faecium pathogenesis using animal models.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated in faecal enterococci from healthy humans, poultry and pets in portugal.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated were studied in 440 enterococci (227 enterococcus faecium, 177 enterococcus faecalis, 32 enterococcus hirae and 4 enterococcus durans) recovered from 220 faecal samples of healthy humans, poultry and pets in portugal. higher levels of resistance were detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol in poultry isolates (10.5%, 97%, 87.5% and 16%, respectively) compared with human isolates (0%, 26%, 31.5% and 5%, respectively); intermediate levels of resistance for these antibiotics were found in pet isolates. thirty-three per cent of the e. faecium isolates of poultry origin showed quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance. high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin was detected in 1-7% of isolates in our series of enterococci. the aac(6')-aph(2''), aph(3')-iiia, erm(b) and tet(m) genes were demonstrated in most of the gentamicin-, kanamycin-, erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant isolates, respectively. the vat(e) gene  was found in 39% of the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium isolates of poultry origin.

TI  == association between enterococcus bacteraemia and death in neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == fatality rates and prognostic factors for mortality due to enterococcus spp. bacteraemia have not yet been fully defined in the setting of neutropenic patients affected with haematological malignancies. we have performed a retrospective, multi-centre cohort study on 98 episodes of enterococcus bacteraemia occurring in patients hospitalised from january 1984 to december 2001 at the oncohaematology units in two tertiary-care hospitals (verona hospital and  vicenza hospital, in north-east italy). e. faecalis was isolated in 52 cases (53%), e. faecium in 39 (39.8%), e. avium in four, e. durans in one, and untyped  enterococcus spp. in two other cases; vancomycin resistance was detected in 15 (15.3%) isolates. a global mortality rate of 41.8% (41/98 cases) was revealed; enterococcus spp. bacteraemia was associated with a fatal outcome in 29/98 cases  (29.5%). the following variables were independently associated with an increased  risk of death by multivariate analysis of survival: age > or =50 years (or 3.74;  95% ci 1.35-10.32), pneumonia (or 4.70; 95% ci 1.67-13.20), and shock (or 13.7; 95% ci 1.23-152.43), while the initial phase of haematological disease (responsive to chemotherapy) appeared to be protective (or 0.23; 95% ci 0.008-0.64, p level 0.005); however, pneumonia alone (or 7.2, 95% ci 2.52-20.88)  was independently associated with fatal outcome by multivariate analysis for death related to enterococcal bacteraemia. in our experience, the poor outcome proper to enterococcal bacteraemia appears to be directly related to underlying disease, patient's age, presence of pneumonia and shock; in contrast, severe neutropaenia, antibiotic resistance, and species of enterococcus do not appear to affect the fatality rate significantly.

TI  == activity of a new oral streptogramin, xrp2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus,  e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a  and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as  with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.

TI  == organization of heat shock dnak and groe operons of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium is a frequently antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogen  that is commonly recovered from hospitalized patients. the genetic organization of the dnak operon was analyzed and was shown to consist of at least four heat shock genes, hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj. the dnak/j intergenic region was 140 bp shorter than in e. faecalis. the dnak operon was expressed from a putative sigma(a)-type  promoter (phrca) upstream of the hrca start codon and was preceded by two conserved circe sequences. northern hybridization revealed the presence of multiple mrnas in the dnak operon. conversely, the groe operon was transcribed as a single mrna. induction of dnak and groel genes occurred in response to either heat shock or exposure to other stress agents.

TI  == a re-emerging class of antimicrobial agents: streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin) in the management of multiresistant gram-positive nosocomial cocci in hospital setting.
AB  == multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, are emerging pathogens in the setting of immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, especially when surgery or invasive procedures are of concern, and patients are admitted in intensive care units. the spectrum of antimicrobial compounds available for an effective treatment of these infection is significantly threatened by the emerging and spread of glycopeptide-resistant strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a novel streptogramine association, which represents an effective response to most of these problems, due to its innovative mechanim of action, its maintained activity against multiresistant pathogens, and its possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds. problems related to the epidemiology of multiresistant gram-positive infection, potential clinical indications of quinupristin/dalfopristin, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of this compound and its derivatives, are outlined on the ground of  a review of available literature evidences.

TI  == pleiotrophic effects of 2 enterococcus faecalis saga-like genes, sala and salb, which encode proteins that are antigenic during human infection, on biofilm formation and binding to collagen type i and fibronectin.
AB  == background: we have shown previously that enterococcus faecium saga has broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins. in the present study, 2 saga-like genes, sala and salb, were identified in enterococcus faecalis. methods: we compared the sala and salb mutants; their parental strain,  og1rf; and the salb-complemented strain for binding to ecm proteins and biofilm formation. results: the salb mutant (tx5123) grew more slowly but showed greater  binding (approximately 10%-20% of cells bound) to fibronectin (fn) and collagen type i (ci) than did og1rf (approximately 1% of cells bound) (p<.001). although tx5123 showed decreased biofilm formation in tryptic soy broth plus 0.25% glucose (tsbg) (p<.001 vs. og1rf), a marked increase in biofilm formation was shown by tx5123 but not by og1rf when they were grown in tsbg plus horse serum (hs) or tsbg plus fn, and the increase was coincident with increased attachment and hydrophobicity of tx5123. complementation of the salb mutant restored the wild-type phenotypes. conclusions: whether salb expression is ever sufficiently low in vivo to enhance adherence to ecm proteins or the serum-elicited increase in biofilm formation seen with the salb mutant in vitro is not currently known, but it is a potential way in which this organism could increase its adherence and biofilm formation during infection.

TI  == pathogenesis of implant infections by enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are commensals of human and animal intestinal tract that have emerged in the last decades as a major cause of nosocomial infections of bloodstream, urinary tract and in infected surgical sites. enterococcus faecalis is responsible for ca. 80% of all enterococcal infections while enterococcus faecium accounts for most of the others; among the most relevant risk factors for development of enterococcal infections is the presence of implanted devices. the  pathogenesis of such infections is poorly understood, but several virulence factors have been proposed. among them, the ability to form biofilm has recently  been shown to be one of the most prominent features of this microorganism, allowing colonization of inert and biological surfaces, while protecting against  antimicrobial substances, and mediating adhesion and invasion of host cells and survival within professional phagocytes. biofilm formation has been shown to be particularly important in the development of prosthetic valve enterococcal endocarditis and stent occlusion. enterococci are also able to express other surface factors that may support colonization of both inert and biological surfaces, and that may be involved in the invasion of, and survival within, the host cell.

TI  == acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired  antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in faecal enterococci of wild animals in portugal.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility was tested in 140 non-selected enterococci (73 enterococcus faecalis, 45 e. faecium and 22 of other species) recovered from faecal samples of 77 wild animals in portugal. susceptibility testing for 11 antibiotics (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and ciprofloxacin) was determined by disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. forty-four isolates (31.4%) showed susceptibility to all the antibiotics tested (5.5% of e. faecalis; 62.2% of e. faecium; and 78.6% of e. hirae). neither ampicillin-resistance nor acquired-vancomycin-resistance was detected and 1.4% of the isolates showed high-level-resistance for gentamicin or streptomycin. tetracycline and erythromycin resistances were shown in 28.6% and 20.1% of the isolates, respectively. antibiotic resistance genes were studied by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing and tet(m) + tet(l), erm(b) or aac(6')-aph(2'') genes were detected in most of tetracycline-, erythromycin- or gentamicin-resistant enterococci respectively. genes encoding virulence factors were studied by pcr and a wide variety of virulence genes were detected in most of e. faecalis isolates but were rarely found in e. faecium and not detected in the other species. the prevalence of genes encoding virulence factors in e. faecalis was as follows: cpd (98.6%), gele (75.3%), agg (30.1%), fsr (17.8%), ace (9.6%) and esp (4.1%). low percentages of antibiotic resistance was found in the  faecal enterococci of wild animals but a wide variety of virulence genes were detected among e. faecalis isolates although were rare in the other species.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the eastern himalayas.
AB  == sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the eastern himalayan regions of nepal and india. a total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. a total of 189 strains of lab were isolated  from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. lab were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including api system as lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactococcus plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. lab strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. some strains of lab showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. none of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. this paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of eastern  himalayas.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the host response against enterococcus faecalis used in probiotic preparations.
AB  == along with other lactic acid bacteria, enterococci are used in food products and  as health promoting agents. the safety of these products must be ensured, because they contain potentially pathogenic microorganisms. here we present an in vitro opsonophagocytic assay that closely mimics the protective human immune response to enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. a collection of closely related e. faecalis isolates used as probiotics showed different susceptibilities to opsonic killing, suggesting that some of these isolates possess a capsule while other do not. this information may be helpful in assessing the safety of a  given bacterial isolate used and could detect likely enterococcal candidates for  probiotic preparations.

TI  == effect of growth promotant usage on enterococci species on a poultry farm.
AB  == the species population of enterococci isolated from four poultry houses for six grow-outs on one farm was determined. two houses on the farm were control houses  and did not use any antimicrobials, while two other houses on the farm used flavomycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin during different poultry grow-outs. litter, chick boxliners, feed, and poultry carcass rinses were obtained from each house and cultured for the presence of enterococci. nine species of enterococci (enterococcusfaecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. casselifiavus, e. cecorum, e. durans, e. gallinarum, e. hirae, and e. malodoratus) were identified from the study. enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from chick boxliners (n=176; 92%) and carcass rinses (n=491; 69%), whereas e. faecium was found more frequently in litter (n=361; 77%) and feed (n=67; 64%). enterococcus faecalis (n=763; 52%) and e. faecium (n=578; 39%) were isolated most often from the farm and houses, regardless of antimicrobial treatment. fifty-two percent of e. faecalis and 39% of e. faecium were isolated from both control (n=389 and 295, respectively) and treatment (n=374 and 283, respectively) samples. this study indicates that antimicrobial usage on this farm did not alter the resident population of enterococci.

TI  == phene plate (php) biochemical fingerprinting. a screening method for epidemiological typing of enterococcal isolates.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) is currently considered the gold standard for genotyping of enterococci. however, pfge is both expensive and time-consuming. the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the php system can be used as a reliable clinical screening method for detection of genetically related isolates of enterococci. if so, it should be possible to minimize the number of isolates subjected to pfge typing, which would save time and money. ninety-nine clinical enterococcal isolates were analysed by php (similarity levels 0.90-0.975) and pfge (similarity levels < or =3 and < or =6 bands) and all possible pairs of isolates were cross-classified as matched or mismatched. we found that the probability that a pair of isolates (a and b) belonging to the same type according to php also belong to the same cluster according to pfge, i.e. p(a(pfge)=b(pfge) * a(php)=b(php)), and the probability that a pair of isolates of different types according to php also belong to different clusters according to pfge, i.e. p(a(pfge) not equalb(pfge) * a(php) not equalb(php)), was relatively high for e. faecalis (0.86 and 0.96, respectively), but was lower for e. faecium (0.51 and 0.77, respectively). the concordance which shows the probability that php and pfge agree on match or mismatch was 86%-93% for e. faecalis and 54%-66% for e. faecium, which indicates  that the php method may be useful for epidemiological typing of e. faecalis in the current settings but not for e. faecium.

TI  == occurrence of antibiotic resistant enterococci in clinical specimens from a pediatric hospital.
AB  == enterococcal infection has become a major clinical problem and e. faecalis and e. faecium are the most frequently isolated species. however, the isolation of other species (e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. durans) from clinical materials was  reported recently. the aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance of 97 species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of upper silesian health  center of child and mother in katowice. each strain was tested for susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and synercid (quinupristine/ dalfopristine) by the e-test method. fifty three percent of studied enterococci demonstrated high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) (mic > 1024 microg/ml). sixty three strains of e. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin (mic 1-4 microg/ml), but 5 strains demonstrated low sensitivity (3 strains with mic = 6 microg/ml and 2 strains with mic = 24 microg/ml). all studied enterococci were sensitive to teicoplanin (mic < 2 microg/ml). a high percentage of e. faecium (70%) resistant to synercid was demonstrated (mic = 2-24 microg/ml). infection control and monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity among isolated hospital strains may prevent the transmission of resistant strains in a  pediatric hospital.

TI  == detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  == aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. in an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 ame genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a japanese hospital, two uncommon ame genes, ant(9)-ia and a novel aph(2") allele,  aph(2")-ie, were detected. ant(9)-ia had been reported only in staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ant(9)-i, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. the ant(9)-ia gene was detected in three strains, a  single strain each of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium. nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for s. aureus and considered to be located on tn 554. the new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-ie, was identified in three e. faecium strains. the aph(2")-ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-id reported in e. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-ia, aph(2")-ib, or aph(2")-ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. in contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. three e. faecium strains having aph(2")-ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-id in  e. casseliflavus. such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie.

TI  == evidence of vancomycin resistance gene transfer between enterococci of human origin in the gut of mice harbouring human microbiota.
AB  == objectives: potential intra- and inter-species transfers of vancomycin resistance genes (vana gene cluster) between enterococcus strains were evaluated in the gut  of heteroxenic mice harbouring a human microbiota. methods: mice colonized with a stable population of e. faecium 64/3 or e. faecalis jh2-2 recipient strain and harbouring an enterococci-free human microbiota were obtained. donor strain e. faecium hc-vi2 of clinical origin was administered orogastrically to these mice and transfers were evaluated over time in faecal samples. results: only intraspecies transfers were detected in the digestive tract (dt) of mice harbouring a human microbiota. e. faecium 64/3 transconjugants were detected at several sampling times over the 60 day experiment to levels up to 10(3) cfu/g of  faeces, but they did not steadily colonize the dt. conclusions: here, we show for the first time that transfer of the vana gene cluster can occur between enterococcus strains in the dt colonized with a human microbiota and in the absence of selective pressure. the colonization properties of other enterococci transconjugants and the influence of vancomycin intake should be further investigated since transfers in the dt of animals and humans might contribute to  emergence and dissemination of new vancomycin-resistant bacteria.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci isolated from patients in a university hospital in southern italy.
AB  == objectives: we evaluated the genetic and molecular basis of high-level resistance to gentamicin and amikacin in 91 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a university hospital in southern italy from 1987 to 2003. methods: antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated by disc diffusion and microdilution methods. genotyping was performed by pfge and dendrogram analysis.  aminoglycoside resistance genes were analysed by multiplex pcr. aminoglycoside resistance gene transfer was performed by filter mating. results: in our strain collection, 44% of e. faecalis and 52% of e. faecium were high-level-resistant to gentamicin. fifty-two pfge profiles were identified for e. faecalis and 15 for e. faecium. although the majority of pfge patterns were single isolates, four patterns (two for e. faecalis and two for e. faecium) were isolated each in 8 and 4, and 6 and 4 different patients, respectively. the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene  was responsible for high-level resistance to gentamicin and amikacin in e. faecalis and e. faecium; the aph(2'')-id gene responsible for resistance to gentamicin was also isolated in e. faecium; the aph(3')-iiia and ant(4')-ia genes responsible for resistance to amikacin were also isolated in e. faecalis and e. faecium. high-level resistance to gentamicin, along with the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene, was transferred at a frequency of about 10(-5) to 10(-8) per recipient cell in 14 of 17 e. faecalis and 3 of 4 e. faecium different genotypes. conclusions: the spread of the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene was responsible for high-level resistance to gentamicin and amikacin among enterococci isolated from patients in our geographical area.

TI  == fluorescent in situ hybridization with specific dna probes offers adequate detection of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in clinical samples.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are among the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections. reliable and quick identification of e. faecalis and e. faecium is important for accurate treatment and understanding their role in the pathogenesis of infections. fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of whole bacterial cells with oligonucleotides targeted at the 16s rrna molecule leads to a reduced time to identification. in clinical practice, fish therefore can be used in situations in which quick identification is necessary for optimal  treatment of the patient. furthermore, the abundance, spatial distribution and bacterial cell morphology can be observed in situ. this report describes the design of two fluorescent-labelled oligonucleotides that, respectively, detect the 16s rrna of e. faecalis and the 16s rrna of e. faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus villorum and enterococcus saccharolyticus. different protocols for the application of these oligonucleotides with fish in different clinical samples such as faeces or blood cultures are given. enterococci in a biofilm attached to a biomaterial were also visualized. embedding of the biomaterial preserved the morphology and therefore the architecture of the biofilm could be observed. the usefulness of other studies describing fish for detection of enterococci is generally hampered by the fact that they have only focused on one material and one protocol to detect the enterococci. however, the results of this study show that the probes can be used  both in the routine laboratory to detect and determine the enterococcal species in different clinical samples and in a research setting to enumerate and detect the enterococci in their physical environment.

TI  == the n-terminal domain of enterococcal surface protein, esp, is sufficient for esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococci have emerged as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream,  surgical site, and urinary tract infections. more recently, enterococci have been associated with biofilms, which are bacterial communities attached to a surface and encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix. the enterococcal cell surface-associated protein, esp, enhances biofilm formation by enterococcus faecalis in a glucose-dependent manner. mature esp consists of a nonrepeat n-terminal domain and a central region made up of two types of tandem repeats followed by a c-terminal membrane-spanning and anchor domain. this study was undertaken to localize the specific domain(s) of esp that plays a role in esp-mediated biofilm enhancement. to achieve this objective, we constructed in-frame deletion mutants expressing truncated forms of esp in an isogenic background. by comparing strains expressing the mutant forms of esp to those expressing wild-type esp, we found that the strain expressing esp lacking the n-terminal domain formed biofilms that were quantitatively less in biovolume than the strain expressing wild-type esp. furthermore, an e. faecalis strain expressing only the n-terminal domain of esp fused to a heterologous protein anchor formed biofilms that were quantitatively similar to those formed by a strain expressing full-length esp. this suggested that the minimal region contributing to esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in e. faecalis was confined to the nonrepeat n-terminal domain. expression of full-length e. faecalis esp in heterologous host systems of esp-deficient lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecium did not enhance biofilm formation as was observed for e. faecalis. these  results suggest that esp may require interaction with an additional e. faecalis-specific factor(s) to result in biofilm enhancement.

AB  == aims: to determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. methods and results: faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. high levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. bacterial isolates presumptively identified as enterococcus on mei media were speciated. the predominant species found in both water and sediment included enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. a number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mei media were subsequently identified as species other than enterococcus. at both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. conclusions: high levels of enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. significance and impact of the study: resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.

TI  == campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., verocytotoxic escherichia coli, and antibiotic resistance in indicator organisms in wild cervids.
AB  == faecal samples were collected, as part of the national health surveillance program for cervids (hop) in norway, from wild red deer, roe deer, moose and reindeer during ordinary hunting seasons from 2001 to 2003. samples from a total  of 618 animals were examined for verocytotoxic e. coli (vtec); 611 animals for salmonella and 324 animals for campylobacter. a total of 50 samples were cultivated from each cervid species in order to isolate the indicator bacterial species e. coli and enterococcus faecalis / e. faecium for antibiotic resistance  pattern studies. salmonella and the potentially human pathogenic verocytotoxic e. coli were not isolated, while campylobacter jejuni jejuni was found in one roe deer sample only. antibiotic resistance was found in 13 (7.3%) of the 179 e. coli isolates tested, eight of these being resistant against one type of antibiotic only. the proportion of resistant e. coli isolates was higher in wild reindeer (24%) than in the other cervids (2.2%). e. faecalis or e. faecium were isolated from 19 of the samples, none of these being reindeer. all the strains isolated were resistant against one (84%) or more (16%) antibiotics. a total of 14 e. faecalis-strains were resistant to virginiamycin only. the results indicate that  the cervid species studied do not constitute an important infectious reservoir for either the human pathogens or the antibiotic resistant microorganisms included in the study.

TI  == enumeration and antibiotic resistance patterns of fecal indicator organisms isolated from migratory canada geese (branta canadensis).
AB  == thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. to determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory canada geese (branta canadensis) on the maryland eastern shore, we isolated enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. samples were obtained in october 2002, january 2003, and march 2003. thermotolerant e. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0x10(7) colony forming units (cfu)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0x10(2)-1.0x10(7) cfu g-1 wet weight of feces. primary isolates of  each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. greater than 95% of e. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin g, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no e. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. the tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination  among e. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) profiles were calculated: fall (e. coli=0.499; enterococci=0.234), winter (e. coli=0.487; enterococci=0.389), and spring (e. coli=0.489; enterococci=0.348). e. faecalis and e. faecium, which are  recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin p, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, in escherichia coli.
AB  == the cloning and expression of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, was studied in escherichia coli. pcr-amplified products of the preenterocin p gene (entp) or entp plus the putative entp immunity gene (entip), were cloned in plasmid petblue-1 under the control of the inducible t7lac promoter. although target genes in derivative plasmids pjg01 (entp) and pjg02 (entp plus entip) did not generate products with  antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the e. coli tuner(de3)placi host. the use of specific antibodies and an elisa permitted the detection and quantification of entp in the supernatant (sn), cellular soluble protein fraction (csf), and inclusion bodies (ib) of e. coli tuner(de3)placi cells transformed with either pjg01 or pjg02. functional entp from the supernatants of e. coli tuner(de3)placi  (pjg01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. a purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active entp from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. the e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of entp, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.

TI  == enterocin as-48rj: a variant of enterocin as-48 chromosomally encoded by enterococcus faecium rj16 isolated from food.
AB  == the bacteriocinogenic strain rj16 isolated from goat cheese has been identified as enterococcusfaecium by species-specific pcr, dna-rrna hybridization and rdna sequencing. purified bacteriocin from strain rj16 is a carboxypeptidase a-resistant peptide with a molecular mass (7125 da) very close to the cyclic peptide enterocin as-48. bacteriocin from strain rj16 and as-48 show identical antibacterial spectra, although the former is slightly less active on strains of  listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. producer strains show cross-immunity. pcr amplification of total dna from strain rj16 with primers for the as-48 structural gene and sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed an almost identical sequence (99.5%), except for a single mutation that predicts the change of glu residue at position 20 of as-48 to val. therefore, bacteriocin produced by e. faecium rj16 should be considered a variant of as-48, which we call as-48rj. pcr amplification revealed that strain rj16 contains the complete as-48. gene cluster. hybridization with probes for as-48 gene cluster revealed a chromosomal  location of as-48 genes in strain rj16, being the first example of a chromosomal  location of this bacteriocin trait. strain rj16 produced enzymes of interest in food processing (esterase, esterase lipase and phytase activities), and did not decarboxylate amino acids precursors for biogenic amines. strain rj16 did not exhibit haemolytic or gelatinase activities, and pcr amplification revealed the lack of genes encoding for known virulence determinants (aggregation substance, collagen adhesin, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigens, as well as haemolysin and gelatinase production). strain rj16 was resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 mgl(-1)) and levofloxacin (mic > 4 mgl(-1)) and showed intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin and erythromycin, but was sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline,  quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. altogether, results from this study suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain may have a potential use in food preservation.

TI  == the susceptibility to growth-promoting antibiotics of enterococcus faecium isolates from pigs and chickens in europe.
AB  == objectives: to establish the susceptibility of enterococcus faecium isolates from pigs and chickens to antimicrobial growth promoters that either were or had been  in use in the european union. methods: samples were taken at abattoirs in two successive years (mid-1998-mid-1999, year 1; mid-1999-mid-2000, year 2) from chickens (france, the netherlands, sweden, uk) and pigs (denmark, the netherlands, spain, sweden). e. faecium was isolated from faecal samples at national laboratories and sent to a central laboratory where mics of avilamycin,  avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin were determined. microbiological breakpoints were allocated on the basis of mic distributions, and comparison was made between host species, country of origin and year of sample. results: in total, 2567 isolates were obtained from chickens  and 1742 from pigs. in all countries, resistance to avoparcin (banned in 1997) was uncommon, but resistance to bacitracin and flavophospholipol was common (and  was probably largely intrinsic). the prevalence of resistance was similar in chicken and pig isolates, with the exception of avilamycin, to which resistance was commoner among chicken isolates. the removal of four compounds as growth promoters (bacitracin, spiramycin, tylosin, virginiamycin) between years 1 and 2  appeared to result in a significant decrease in resistance to three of them-spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, with no change in resistance to bacitracin, but an increase in resistance to avilamycin (not discontinued). associated resistance was shown between some of the compounds. conclusions: resistance prevalence declined rapidly following removal of growth promoters in pigs and chickens, suggesting that in the absence of selective pressure, a susceptible population began to replace phenotypically resistant strains. associated resistance between different compounds, where seen, could have resulted from either shared resistance mechanisms or from carriage of resistance  genes on the same plasmid. multiresistance to streptogramins, macrolides and glycopeptides was rare.

TI  == [enterococcal bacteremia at nimes university hospital].
AB  == purpose of the study: the aim of this study was the description of enterococcal bacteremia and the evaluation of their resistance evolution to antibiotics and the virulence profile of these isolates. patients and methods: we have studied all the bacteremia caused by enterococcus spp. from the 1st of july 2003 until the 30th of june 2004 at nimes university hospital. for each isolate, population, clinical and microbiological data were collected. multiplex pcr allowed for the identification of glycoprotein resistant phenotypes and furthermore, to identify  the main virulence genes found in the enterococci. results: thirty-three strains  were identified from 33 patients (60.6% male) with a median age of 68 years (median: 3-96). the vital prognostic was calculated in 63.6% of the cases (maccabe > or =1); seven patients died during their hospitalization (21.2%). the  infections were nosocomial in 60.6% of the cases. no epidemic was observed. the principal comorbidities were cardiovascular and digestive pathologies. in addition, 54.5% of patients had had a surgical intervention. enterococcus faecalis (87.9%) was the cause of infection in the majority of cases followed by  enterococcus faecium. most of the infections were monomicrobial (75.8%). e. faecalis was sensitive to amoxicillin and to glycopeptides but was resistant to norfloxacin, erythromycin and pristinamycin. the same observations were made for  the e. faecium with the exception of amoxicillin. e. faecalis had the maximum number of virulence genes and e. faecium the least. conclusion: the enterococcal  bacteremia had mainly a nosocomial origin. the isolates came from digestive tract flora but also from catheters. the mortality rate was 21.2%. a developing sensitivity to erythromycin and pristinamycin was observed in comparison to the data of the onerba (2002-2003). only one isolate was resistant to glycopeptide. this was the first european e. faecium containing the vand allele. this isolate proved fatal to the patient. the dark evolution of enterococcal bacteremia and their frequent nosocomial origin induce to promote studies intended for better knowing the risk factors of such infections.

TI  == control of listeria monocytogenes in model sausages by enterocin as-48.
AB  == in this work we describe the control of listeria monocytogenes cect 4032 in sausage by adding the enterocin as-48 producer strains enterococcus faecalis a-48-32 and enterococcus faecium s-32-81, and also by adding a semi-purified preparation of the bacteriocin. addition of preformed as-48 caused a significant  decrease (p<0.01) in the number of viable listeria even at the lowest bacteriocin concentration tested (112 au/g). at a higher concentration (225 au/g) listeria were below the detection level (1.99 log units/g) in meat at 3 days of incubation but growth of listeria was observed again after 9 days. for an as-48 concentration of 450 au/g, no viable listeria were detected after 6 and 9 days of incubation. when e. faecalis a-48-32 was used as inoculum at approximately 10(7)  cfu/g, listeria counts decreased progressively from start of experiment, being below detection level at day 9. the best results were obtained with e. faecium s-32-81, since listeria were undetectable at 6 days of incubation. bacteriocin concentrations in samples reached concentrations of 60 and 80 au/g for strains a-48-32 and s-32-81, respectively. these results clearly indicate that as-48 can  be used in the control of l. monocytogenes in sausages.

TI  == [factors of virulence and mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides in clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with high-level gentamicin resistance].
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium are grampositive commensal bacteria that may become pathogenic under the selection pressure. in view of natural resistance and effective mechanisms of genetic transfer, the treatment of enterococcal diseases  is rather complicated. aminoglycosides are clinically relevant antimicrobials that are frequently prescribed in practice since having good pharmacokinetics and showing synergism with beta-lactam and glycopeptides. one of the major mechanisms involved in aminoglycoside resistance is inactivation of the antibiotic agent by  aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (agmes) differing in the capacity for inactivation of specific types of aminoglycosides. the factors of virulence are also involved in enterococcal pathogenicity but their role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases remains unclear. production of beta-hemolysin (hly), gelatinase (gel), and aggregation substance (as), and synthesis of enterococcal surface protein (esp) are among the most frequently studied potential virulence factors.

TI  == acquisition of resistant bowel flora during a double-blind randomized clinical trial of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for intraabdominal infections.
AB  == bowel colonization with resistant bacteria can develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. we compared the impact of two antimicrobial regimens often used to treat intraabdominal infections on susceptibility patterns of bowel flora at the end of therapy. in a double-blind clinical trial, adults with complicated intraabdominal infection requiring surgery were randomized to receive piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) or ertapenem (1 g once a day) for 4 to 14 days. rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of study  therapy to determine the acquisition rates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to the study drug, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella species, pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. treated patients were assessable for the acquisition of resistant bacteria if appropriate specimens were obtained at both time points. enterobacteriaceae resistant to the treatment received were acquired during study therapy by 8/122 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (6.6%) compared to 0/122 assessable ertapenem recipients (p = 0.007). neither esbl-producing e. coli or klebsiella species nor p. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam was  isolated from patients in either treatment group. imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa was acquired by two of the ertapenem recipients (1.6%) versus zero of  the piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (p = 0.50). vancomycin-resistant enterococci were acquired during therapy by 8/125 assessable ertapenem recipients (6.4%) versus 2/123 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (1.6%; p = 0.10). in this study, the acquisition of resistant enterobacteriaceae occurred significantly more often in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam than in those treated with ertapenem.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

AB  == the effect of high-pressure (hp) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (lab) produced in situ on the survival of escherichia coli o157:h7  in cheese was investigated. cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml. seven different bacteriocin-producing lab were added at approximately 10(6) cfu/ml as adjuncts to the starter. cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 mpa for 10 min or 500 mpa for 5 min, at 10 degrees c in both cases. after 60 days, e. coli o157:h7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized were 5.1 log cfu/g. a higher inactivation of e. coli o157:h7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing lab when 300 mpa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). application of 500 mpa eliminated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab were synergistic and reduced e. coli o157:h7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 50 and addition of nisin  a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, enterocin i-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab completely inactivated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. the application of  reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing lab is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance to imipenem and ampicillin in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == we found ampicillin- and imipenem-resistant isolates of vana-possessing enterococcus faecalis with mics of 8 to 16 microg/ml and 4 to 32 microg/ml, respectively. there have been few reports about penicillin- and imipenem-resistant e. faecalis. two mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in e. faecalis, the production of beta-lactamase and the overproduction of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), have been reported. the resistant isolates in the current study did not produce any beta-lactamases and analysis of the pbps showed no overproduction. however, the affinities of pbp4 for beta-lactams in the resistant strains were lower than those of susceptible strains but the affinities of other pbps for beta-lactams did not change. accordingly, whole pbp4 fragments  from these resistant isolates were sequenced. two amino acid substitutions at positions 520 and 605 were observed in the highly resistant strains compared to the susceptible ones, pro520ser and tyr605his, and a single tyr605his amino acid  substitution was found in the low-resistance strains. these two point mutations exist in the region between the active-site-defining motifs sdn and ktg of the penicillin-binding domain, the main target of beta-lactams. a strong correlation  was seen between these substitutions and decreasing affinities of pbp4 to beta-lactams. in e. faecalis, resistance due to mutations in pbps has not been reported, though it has in enterococcus faecium. our results suggest that development of high-level resistance to penicillins and imipenem depends on point mutations of pbp4 at positions 520 and 605.

TI  == survivability of vancomycin resistant enterococci and fitness cost of vancomycin  resistance acquisition.
AB  == aims: to investigate the survivability of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre)  under dry starvation conditions and the fitness cost of vancomycin resistance. methods: vre colonies on cotton swabs were incubated at room temperature in a sterile box and cultured weekly until cultures no longer showed growth. negative  swabs inoculated into brain heart infusion (bhi) broth were subcultured to blood  agar after 24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation to resuscitate viable but non-culturable cells. stability of the vancomycin resistance determinant and of the dna fingerprint pattern was determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and repetitive pcr, respectively. tests for fitness cost were carried out on the same vre isolates and 28 hospital vancomycin sensitive enterococci (vse) isolates by incubation and measurement of optical density using a microplate reader and comparing maximum growth rate and lag phase duration between vre and vse, using independent samples t tests. results: mean maximum time of recovery by primary culture was 8.5 weeks for enterococcus faecalis vre and 21.8 weeks for e. faecium vre. two of two e. faecalis isolates were resuscitated after 24 hours in  bhi broth, and two of five e. faecium isolates after 72 hours. no fitness cost of vancomycin resistance was demonstrated. conclusions: vre can survive for prolonged periods in a dry starvation state, retaining their genetic complement,  including vancomycin resistance determinants, and show little or no fitness cost  of vancomycin resistance. thus, the rate of entry required for vre to become, and remain, endemic in the community is relatively small.

AB  == a rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  (vre) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in taiwan was  found. the noticeable rise of mrsa and vre was significantly correlated with the  increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones  (pearson's correlation coefficient, p < 0.05). minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of mrsa (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. all of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/l of tigecycline, and all mrsa isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/l, including two isolates of mrsa with heteroresistance to vancomycin. daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic90, 2 mg/l) than against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic90, 4 mg/l). decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and mrsa to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (mic90, 8 mg/l). linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant gram-positive organisms.

TI  == [microbiological external quality assurance program (meqap)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

TI  == bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

TI  == effect of endodontic procedures on enterococci, enteric bacteria and yeasts in primary endodontic infections.
AB  == aim: to detect enterococci, enteric bacteria and yeast species from the canals of teeth with primary endodontic infections before and after canal preparation and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of enterococcal strains isolated from infected root canals. methodology: twenty-five single-rooted teeth with pulp necrosis, intact pulp chambers and periradicular lesions were selected for study. samples were collected from canals before and after instrumentation. amongst isolated microorganisms from infected root canals only enterococci, enteric bacteria and yeasts were identified by biochemical tests. the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated enterococci strains was evaluated by the etest system. results: microorganisms were isolated from 92% of the samples following intracoronal access, 22% were enterococci, enteric bacteria or yeast species. after biomechanical preparation, these species were no longer detected.  after 7 days without intracanal dressing, 100% of the canals contained microorganisms, 52% of which were target species. however, after using paramonochlorophenol [prp (2.0 g), rinosoro and polyethylene glycol (400 equal parts up to 100 ml)] as an intracanal dressing for 7 days, enteric bacteria and yeasts were not detected; only enterococci were still present. all strains of enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin, but exhibited variable susceptibility to rifampin and ciprofloxacin. conclusions: enterococci, enteric bacteria and yeasts were present in primary endodontic infections. enterococci, particularly enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium were resistant to removal by root canal preparation followed by intracanal dressing.

TI  == the prevalence of fecal colonization of enterococci, the resistance of the isolates to ampicillin, vancomycin, and high-level aminoglycosides, and the clonal relationship among isolates.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract carriage of enterococci was searched in 150 hospitalized patients and 100 outpatients, and clonal relatedness of the isolates and their resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and high-level streptomycin and gentamicin were investigated. a stool sample or rectal swab collected from each patient was inoculated into appropriate media within an hour. enterococcus species were identified by using conventional biochemical tests, api-20 strep assay, and bbl crystal kit. antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using  kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to  detect vana and vanb genes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) methods were used for molecular typing of the strains. enterococci were isolated from 90 (60%) of the specimens collected from 150 inpatients. of these 90 isolates, 37 (41%) had high-level gentamicin resistance, 36 (40%) had high-level streptomycin resistance, and 50 (55.6%) had ampicillin resistance. fecal colonization was found in 30% of the outpatients. resistances to ampicillin, high-level streptomycin, and gentamicin were 13%, 10%, and 3%, in these patients' isolates,  respectively. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were detected by both agar diffusion and pcr assays in our study. both typing procedures were applied on 78  enterococcus strains isolated from inpatients. ap-pcr typing showed that 30 (50.8%) of the 59 e. faecium and 5 (50%) of the 10 e. faecalis strains were clonally related. these values were found to be 12 (20.3%) and two (20%) by pfge, respectively. the typing procedures did not find any clustered strains in the six e. durans and three e. avium isolates. neither pfge nor ap-pcr result was significantly different among the sensitive and resistant strains. our results indicate that the high prevalence of colonization with ampicillin and highlevel aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci is an important problem in our medical center. the high clonal diversity among the isolates indicates limited spread of  antibiotic-resistant strains between patients.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in turkey.
AB  == susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, high-level  resistance to aminoglycosides (gentamicin and streptomycin) and beta-lactamase production were investigated among 264 consecutive clinical enterococcal isolates in turkey. disc diffusion test was used to detect resistance to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  was determined both by standard agar screening and by disc diffusion methods. the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each isolate for ampicillin,  vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined by the microbroth dilution technique.  the isolates were found to consist of enterococcus faecalis (78%), enterococcus faecium (9%) and enterococcus spp. (12%). in all strains, the penicillin and ampicillin resistance ratios were 27% and 26%, respectively. enterococcus faecalis was more susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin than the other strains. none of the strains were resistant to glycopeptides. high-level aminoglycoside resistance was found in 16% e. faecalis and 88% e. faecium for gentamicin, and 35% and 44%, respectively, for streptomycin. there were no differences between the two methods used to determine the aminoglycoside resistance rates in the enterococcal isolates. no beta-lactamase-producing isolates were detected in either species. in conclusion, to determine the resistance of enterococci to the penicillin group of drugs by the disc diffusion  method, both penicillin and ampicillin discs should be evaluated. in serious enterococcal infections, before starting combined therapy, high-level aminoglycoside resistance should be investigated.

TI  == genotypic diversity and epidemiology of high-level gentamicin resistant enterococcus in a chinese hospital.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antibiotics resistance of enterococcus, the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ame) and homology of high-level gentamicin resistant (hlgr) enterococcus in clinical specimens for the implementation of effective infection control measures. methods: the resistance of 13 antimicrobial agents was determined by kirby-bauer (k-b) or agar dilution method. and the hlgr  and high-level streptomycin resistant (hlsr) isolates were screened by agar screen. production of beta-lactamases was tested by the nitrocefin disc method. the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was used to analyze the homology of hlgr isolates from in-patients. results: no isolates resistant to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin were found. ampicillin-resistant isolates did not produce beta-lactamases and 68 hlgr isolates were screened at the rate of 64.2%. the positive rate of aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia was 86.8% and 3 isolates had the new ame gene designated aph(2'')-ie mostly similar to aph(2'')-id. among 51 hlgr isolates from in-patients, pfge grouped 17 enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) isolates into 4 clusters (a-d), and 33 enterococcus faecium (e. faecium) isolates into 8 clusters (a-h), of which the a cluster is the main. conclusions: hlgr has become the important antibiotic resistance pathogen causing nocosomial infection. and the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia gene was the main aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene leading to hlgr.

TI  == contribution of enterococci to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the production chain of swine meat commodities.
AB  == thirty-six samples, including fecal specimens, dry feedstuffs, raw and processed  pork meat products, and dry fermented sausages, were collected from two production chains of swine meat commodities and analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotic resistance (ar) genes. specific pcr assays carried out on dna extracted directly from the samples revealed a high incidence of the genes tet(k) (80.5%), ermb (66.7%), and tet(m) (66.7%). feces and feedstuffs gave the largest  number of positive amplifications. to elucidate the contribution of enterococci to the occurrence and spread of ar, 146 resistant enterococci were isolated, and  their identity, genetic fingerprints, and ar gene profiles were determined by means of molecular techniques. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were the predominant isolated species (43.8 and 38.4%, respectively); other enterococcus species identified were e. durans (8.9%), e. hirae (2.7%), e. gallinarum (2.1%), e. mundtii (2.1%), and e. casseliflavus (2.1%). a number of isolates displayed a complex ar gene profile comprising up to four different resistance determinants. the genes tet(m) and ermb were highly diffused, being present in 86.9 and 84.9%, respectively, of the isolates. the application of amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting was particularly valuable to monitor the resistant enterococcal isolates along the production chain and to  individuate steps in which contamination might occur. in fact, isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium showing the same amplified fragment length polymorphism profile and ar gene pattern were detected in samples taken at different steps of  the food chain suggesting three cases of bacterial clonal spread.

TI  == colonization by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci in intensive care unit patients: epidemiology and clinical relevance.
AB  == a cohort study was performed to investigate the risk factors for colonization with high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci (hlare) in intensive care unit (icu) patients. colonization was investigated by performing surveillance samples during icu stay. clonal relatedness of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. eighty-six patients with an icu stay of >48 h were included; two were colonized with hlare at admission, and 24 (28.5%) acquired hlare during their stay in the icu. hlare were initially isolated from rectal swabs alone. thirty-five percent of enterococcus faecalis and 57% of e. faecium showed high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin. most isolates were clonally unrelated. using multi-variate analysis, the only variable associated with hlare colonization was previous antimicrobial use. five patients  had hlare isolated from clinical samples, three of them with infection; in all of these, colonization with the same clone had been detected previously by surveillance samples. we conclude that most infections due to hlare in the icu are preceded by previous colonization, and that antimicrobial use is the main risk factor for colonization.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and virulence factors among clinical and food enterococci isolated in slovakia.
AB  == the resistance to antibiotics and the distribution of virulence factors in enterococci isolated from traditional slovak sheep cheese bryndza was compared with strains from human infections. the occurrence of 4 enterococcal species was  observed in 117 bryndza-cheese isolates. the majority of strains were identified  as e. faecium (76 %) and e. faecalis (23 %). several strains of e. durans and 1 strain of e. hirae were also present. more than 90 % of strains isolated from 109 clinical enterococci were e. faecalis, the rest belonged to e. faecium. the resistance to 6 antimicrobial substances (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, higher concentration of gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline and vancomycin) was tested in clinical and food enterococci. a higher level of resistance was found in clinical than in food strains and e. faecium had a higher resistance than e. faecalis; no resistance to vancomycin was detected. the occurrence of 3 virulence-associated genes, cyla (coding for hemolysin), gele (coding for gelatinase) and esp (coding for surface protein) was monitored. differences were  found in the distribution of cyla gene between clinical and bryndza-cheese e. faecalis strains; in contrast to clinical strains (45 %), cyla gene was detected  in 22 % of food isolates. the distribution of 2 other virulence factors, gele and esp, was not significantly different in the two groups of e. faecalis strains. cyla and gele genes were not detected in e. faecium but more than 70 % of clinical e. faecium were positive for esp, even thought none of the 79 e. faecium cheese isolates contained this gene.

TI  == microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. a total of 137 oligonucleotides (26  to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. the microarrays (arraytubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of bacillus  anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pre25. analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. in both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. the arraytube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known  in gram-positive bacteria. this technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == objectives: the existing therapeutic options for complicated urinary tract infections (uti) caused by gram-positive uropathogens are not always optimal. therefore, newer antimicrobials have to be assessed. methods: the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin was tested versus linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (enterococci on ly), against pathogens from three different collections: (1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis of the urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multicenter study comprising 37 urological centers throughout germany. (3) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates of patients and staff within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (only tested against enterococci) were determined by an agar dilution method using a multipointer with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point. results: for all methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 25), mrsa (n = 49), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 129), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), for enterococcus faecalis (n = 289), and for enterococcus faecium (n =  4) the mics ranged up to 2 mg/l (daptomycin, linezolid), up to 4 mg/l (vancomycin), and up to 8 mg/l (ampicillin, enterococci only) indicating that all strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. conclusions: according to the in vitro activity daptomycin may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus,  daptomycin should be evaluated in a clinical study.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcal blood isolates at a pediatric care hospital in india.
AB  == enterococci are one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. in recent years, enterococci have become increasingly resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. from april to october 2001, a study was conducted to speciate and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of 50 isolates of enterococci from bacteremic children. these isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to the commonly used antibiotics. screening for vancomycin resistance was done by the agar screen method, and the results were confirmed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) using the agar dilution method. it was observed that 33 isolates were enterococcus faecium, followed by e. faecalis (10), e. durans (4), and e. dispar (3). seventy-two percent of strains were resistant to ampicillin, 46% to amoxicillin + clavulanic  acid, 72% to ciprofloxacin, 54% to doxycyclin, and 74% to erythromycin. sixty-six percent of isolates showed high-level gentamicin resistance and 42% showed high-level streptomycin resistance. four strains showed raised mic to vancomycin  (8 microg/ml). it was concluded that multidrug resistant e. faecium is emerging as an important agent of bacteremia in children.

TI  == genetic diversity and safety aspects of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  == aims: to determine the biodiversity of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo and fuet) at species and strain level by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. methods and results: species-specific pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rrna and soda genes were used to identify enterococcal population. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species followed by e. faecalis, e. hirae and e. durans. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr revealed species-specific clusters and allowed strain  typing. sixty strains of 106 isolates exhibited different rapd profiles indicating a high genetic variability. all the e. faecalis strains carried virulence genes (efaafs, esp, agg and gele) and all e. faecium isolates carried efaafm gene. enterococcus faecalis showed higher antibiotic resistance than the other species. only one e. faecium strain showed vana genotype (high-level resistance to glycopeptides) and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates showed vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes (low-level resistance only to vancomycin) respectively. conclusions: e. faecalis has been mainly associated with virulence factors and antimicrobial multi-resistance and, although potential risk for human health is low, the presence of this species in slightly fermented  sausages should be avoided to obtain high quality products. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal population of slightly fermented sausages has been thoroughly characterized. several relevant safety aspects have been revealed.

TI  == daptomycin: a new drug class for the treatment of gram-positive infections.
AB  == daptomycin is the first member of a new class of bactericidal antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptides. in september 2003, daptomycin was approved for the treatment of gram-positive infections associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. a key feature of daptomycin is its rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against significant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (vre). daptomycin also has a unique mechanism of action, no  cross-resistance with any other class of antibiotic and a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect in vitro. in the united states, daptomycin has been approved for use at a dose of 4 mg/ kg once daily in the treatment of s. aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), three beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) and e. faecalis associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. in addition, daptomycin is undergoing a phase iii evaluation for the treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis due to s. aureus. with its once-daily dosing, favorable safety profile and low potential for resistance, daptomycin is a powerful new antibiotic therapy against gram-positive infections.

TI  == clonal spread of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strain among bloodstream-infecting isolates in italy.
AB  == recent data indicated that the rate of vancomycin resistance in bloodstream-infecting enterococcal isolates in italy is one of the highest in europe. the aims of this study were to characterize bloodstream-infecting vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) obtained from various italian hospitals and to establish whether the isolates were clonally related. during the years 2001 to 2003, a total of 39 vre isolates were obtained from 19 hospital laboratories in various areas of italy. species identification and resistance genotypes of the isolates were obtained by multiplex pcr. further characterization included antibiotic susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of smai-digested genomic dna, detection of virulence genes (esp and hyl), and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) of selected isolates. vre were identified as 31 enterococcus faecium (vrefm) isolates and 8 e. faecalis isolates. all but one isolate carried the vana gene; one vrefm isolate carried the vanb gene. analysis of the pfge profiles showed that 28 vrefm isolates shared a similar electrophoretic profile, designed type 1, and were clonally related. all type 1 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin and were positive for the esp gene. mlst identified an allelic profile (st78) comprising purk allele 1, belonging to the c1 clonal lineage, characteristic of human infection and hospital outbreak isolates. the vanb-carrying vrefm isolate, of pfge type 2, was shown to be a single-locus variant of st78. our data indicate that the recent increase in the number of bloodstream infections caused by vre in italy is due to the spread of a hospital-adapted, multidrug-resistant vrefm clone belonging to an internationally disseminated lineage.

AB  == the proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant  to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. in the usa in 2000, the national nosocomial infections  surveillance system reported that >50% of staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). the emergence of community-acquired mrsa is a new concern. mrsa are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. the increasing prevalence of mrsa contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus have been reported. therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against gram-positive pathogens. daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the usa. the two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the usa.

TI  == bacterial 2-component signal transduction systems: a fluorescence polarization screen for response regulator-protein binding.
AB  == two-component signal transduction systems are the primary means by which bacteria sense environmental change and integrate an adaptive response. in pathogenic bacteria, 2-component signal transduction (tcst) kinases are involved in the expression of virulence and antibiotic resistance. this makes bacterial tcst systems attractive targets for pharmacologic intervention. this paper describes a fluorescence polarization assay that quantifies the binding between bacterial dna promoter segments and their cognate response regulator proteins. using the van rstcst system from enterococcus faecium, which encodes vancomycin resistance, the authors demonstrate inhibition of response regulator protein/promoter segment binding with a known inhibitor. observed binding constants were comparable to those reported in surface plasmon resonance measurements and gel shift measurements.

TI  == [inhibition of hemolytic activity of staphylococcus aureus 3-hemolysin by an exosubstance produced by some enterococcus faecalis strains].
AB  == objective: accidentally, some enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. the study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and  to characterize the inhibitory agent. materials and methods: ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of e. faecalis and nine wild e. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: columbia agar base (bbl, 211124), columbia agar (bio merieux, 51026), blood agar base (bio-rad, 64524), blood agar  base (columbia) (ferosa, 1-034), columbia blood agar base (himedia, m114), blood  agar base no. 4 (imuna), columbia agar base (merck, 10455) and columbia agar base (oxoid, cm331). the exosubstance produced by e. faecalis strains was isolated by  means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. results: thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of e. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. two out of five e. faecalis type strains and none of e. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of blood agar base no. 4 (imuna) and columbia agar base (bbl) at ph 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees c for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. the inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated  with the ability of strains to produce protease. conclusion: about one third of wild e. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.

TI  == occurrence of insertion sequences within the genomes and tn1546-like elements of  glycopeptide-resistant enterococci isolated in brazil, and identification of a novel element, isefa5.
AB  == insertion sequences (is) occur widely within the tn1546-like elements responsible for vana glycopeptide resistance in enterococci from several countries. as such insertions can be used as epidemiological markers and for studying horizontal transfer of gene clusters, we investigated the distribution of is6770, is1542, is1216v, is1476, and is1251 elements in 26 vana enterococcus faecium and 21 vana  enterococcus faecalis from brazil. pcr, using genomic dna as a template, indicated that most of the isolates contained is6770 (97%), is1216v (87%) and is1476 (72%) elements. is1251 was also detected, but at a higher frequency in e.  faecium (80%) than in e. faecalis (14%). none of the isolates harboured is1542. only two of 47 isolates had is elements within their tn1546-like elements; one possessed is1251 between vans and vanh, as reported in the united states; another possessed a novel is element, designated isefa5, located between vanx and van y.  this novel element was found in the genomic dna of 25 (96%) e. faecium and ii (52%) e. faecalis. in stability studies, no is-mediated changes were detected in  the tn1546-like elements of 25 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) monitored over 11 months. these results suggest that the occurrence of is in brazilian isolates is similar to that reported in american isolates, but that these elements occur rarely within the vana gene clusters. as patterns of is carriage did not correlate with the pfge type of the vre, the prevalence of is elements in genomic dna of vre is not a useful epidemiological marker. however, the presence  of is-modified tn1546-like elements, which appear to be rare in brazil, could be  a useful molecular marker in local epidemiological studies to monitor the evolution and horizontal transmission of vana elements.

TI  == emergence of unusual species of enterococci causing infections, south india.
AB  == background: enterococci tend to be one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections, with e. faecalis and e. faecium accounting up to 90% of the clinical  isolates. nevertheless, the incidence of other species of enterococci from clinical sources shows an alarming increase with the properties of intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics including beta-lactams and glycopeptides. thus  proper identification of enterococci to species level is quintessential for management and prevention of these bacteria in any healthcare facility. hence this work was undertaken to study the prevalence of unusual species of enterococci causing human infections, in a tertiary care hospital in south india. methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south india from  july 2001 to june 2003. isolates of enterococci were collected from various clinical specimens and speciated using extensive phenotypic and physiological tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed and interpreted as per nccls guidelines. whole cell protein (wcp) fingerprinting of enterococci were done for species validation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and analyzed computationally. results: our study showed the prevalence of unusual (non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci) and atypical (biochemical variant) species of enterococci as 19% (46 isolates) and 5% (12 isolates) respectively. the 7 unusual species (46 isolates) isolated and confirmed by phenotypic characterization includes: 15 e. gallinarum (6.2%), 10 e. avium (4.1%), 6 e. raffinosus (2.5%), 6 e. hirae (2.5%), 4 e. mundtii (1.7%), 3 e. casseliflavus-including the two atypical isolates (1.2%) and 2 e. durans (0.8%). the 12 atypical enterococcal species (5%) that showed aberrant sugar reactions in conventional phenotyping were confirmed as e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus respectively by wcp fingerprinting. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing depicted the emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance among different species apart from intrinsic vancomycin resistance by some species, while all the species tested were susceptible for linezolid and teicoplanin. conclusion: our study reveals the emergence of multi-drug resistance among unusual species of enterococci posing a serious therapeutic challenge. precise identification of enterococci to species level enables us to access the species-specific antimicrobial resistance characteristics, apart from knowing the epidemiological pattern and their clinical significance in human infections.

TI  == evaluation of the evigene vre detection kit for detection of vana and vanb genes  in vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the evigene vre detection kit and compare it with pcr, considered the gold standard for detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the correlation between the mic values of vancomycin and teicoplanin using the epsilon test was also determined. in the  evigene vre detection kit, dna probes specific for bacterial target dna sequences are bound to microwell plates. a hundred and ten vre (104 enterococcus faecium and six enterococcus faecalis) and 45 vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium were tested. all vre strains were found to be positive for the vana genotype using the evigene vre detection kit. all results obtained with the evigene vre detection kit were confirmed by pcr. mic results for the strains also correlated highly with the pcr and kit results. the evigene vre detection kit should be used in preference to other methods for detecting resistance genes in all strains, since  it is less time-consuming, does not require the handling of hazardous chemicals and has the same specificity as pcr.

TI  == determination of antibiotic resistance and resistance plasmids of clinical enterococcus species.
AB  == to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern and resistance plasmids, we studied 23 antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of enterococcus spp. which caused infection in bayindir-ankara hospital, turkey. biochemical and physiological identification tests were applied by the vitek system and compared  with the results of protein profiles by sds-page. from 23 isolates, 20 were identified as e. faecalis, 2 as e. faecium and 1 as e. gallinarum. twenty four antibiotics belong to 10 different groups were used in susceptibility tests. multiple antibiotic resistance was determined in 10 of 23 enterococcus spp. overall resistance to the used antibiotics was 47.3% and low level resistance was 16.6%. among the isolates tested, 8.7% demonstrated high level gentamicin resistance, 17.4% demonstrated high level streptomycin resistance, and 43.5% demonstrated penicillin resistance. high level vancomycin resistant enterococcus  spp. rate was 34.8%, and 60.9% exhibited low level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. they contain plasmids which varied in numbers between 1 and 11 and the plasmid sizes ranged from 2.08 to 56.15 kb. in curing experiments with acriflavine, two different plasmids were shown in different molecular sizes of 33.49 and 13.6 kb while the first determined glycopeptide and penicillin resistance, the second one determined either glycopeptide or penicillin resistance in two different e. faecalis strains. on the other hand, a 22.58 kb plasmid, determining kanamycin resistance, was detected in an e. faecium strain.  after the curing experiments, an elimination of 37.17 and 44.47 kda protein bands was shown in e. faecium efa1 and e. faecalis efa13 in sds-page, respectively. this survey indicates the increase of antibiotic-resistant enterococci, especially to vancomycin in our hospital isolates.

TI  == homofermentative lactic acid bacteria of a traditional cheese, comlek peyniri from cappadocia region.
AB  == comlek peyniri is a typical artisanal cheese in central anatolia. this type of cheese was made by using the indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora of cow or ewes' milk. majority of the samples were taken from fresh cheese because the aim was to isolate homofermentative lab. initially 661 microbial isolates were obtained from 17 cheese samples. only 107 were found to be homofermentative lab.  these isolates were selected and identified by using both phenotypic and molecular methods. phenotypic identification included curd formation from skim milk, catalase test, gram staining and light microscopy, growth at different temperatures and salt concentrations, arginine hydrolysis, gas production from glucose, and carbohydrate fermentation. molecular identification was based on the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) of  the 16s rrna gene-its (internally transcribed spacer) region. by combining the phenotypic and molecular identification results, isolates belonging to each of the following genera were determined at species or subspecies level: 54 lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 3 ec. faecalis, 2 ec.  durans, 10 ec. sp., 15 lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and 2 lb. casei  strains. technological characterisation was also performed by culturing each of the strains in uht skim milk, and by monitoring ph change and lactic acid production at certain time intervals through the 24 h incubation. results of the  technological characterisation indicated that 33% of the isolates (35 strains) were capable of lowering the ph of uht milk below 5.3 after 6 h incubation at 30  degrees c. thirty four of these strains were lc. lactis subsp. lactis, and only one was an ec. faecium strain.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == this study reports the results about antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil. the identification of strains at species level was performed by conventional biochemical tests, api 20 strep (biomerieux), and polymerase chain reaction assay. the species distribution was e. faecium (34%), followed by e. faecalis (33%), e. gallinarum (23.7%), e. casseliflavus (5.2%), e. avium (1%), and e. hirae (1%). intrinsic resistance to vancomycin characterized by presence of vanc genes was found in e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. the high prevalence of vanc phenotype enterococci is very important because these species  have been reported as causing a wide variety of infections. vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium or e. faecalis were not found and no one isolate of these species was  a beta-lactamase producer. thirteen clinical isolates of enterococci (13.4%) showed multiresistance patterns, which were defined by resistance to three classes of antibiotics plus resistance to at least one aminoglycoside (gentamicin and/or streptomycin). the resistance to several antimicrobials shown by enterococcal strains obtained in this study is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.

AB  == we determined the groesl sequences (groes, groel, and the intergenic spacer) of 10 clinically relevant enterococcus species and evaluated the feasibility of identifying enterococcus species on the basis of these sequences. seven common clinical enterococcus species, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. raffinosus, and e. hirae, and three less common enterococcus species, e. cecorum, e. durans, and e. mundtii, were examined in this study. we found that the groes genes of these enterococcal species are identical in length (285 nucleotides) and contain an unusual putative start codon, gtg. the lengths and sequences of the intergenic regions (spacers between  the groes and groel genes) are quite variable (17 to 57 bp in length) among enterococcus species but are conserved in strains within each species, with only  a few exceptions. considerable variation of groes or groel sequences was also observed. the evolutionary trees of groes or groel sequences revealed similarities among enterococcus species. however, the overall intraspecies variation of groes was less than that of groel. the high interspecies variation and low intraspecies variation indicate that the groes and spacer sequences are more useful than groel for identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species. the sequences of these two genetic traits, groes and spacer, can be determined by a single pcr and direct sequencing and may provide important information for the differentiation of closely related species of enterococcus.

TI  == drug resistance in fecal enterococci in hong kong.
AB  == our purpose was to estimate the rate of carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in hospitalized patients in a district hospital and in healthy  subjects in the community in hong kong. rectal swabs were collected from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and stool specimens were collected  from all patients presenting with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea over a 2-month period. stool specimens were also collected from healthy subjects in the  community. specimens were enriched and cultured on selective media for the isolation of enterococci. all isolates were identified, and their minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin was determined. susceptibility to other antibiotics was investigated. samples yielded 125 isolates of enterococci, the majority of isolates being enterococcus faecalis (75) and e. faecium (35). nine of 11 strains of e. gallinarum and 2 of 2 strains of e. casseliflavus isolated from hospitalized patients were intermediately resistant to vancomycin, but no strains highly resistant to vancomycin were isolated. resistance to other drugs,  including the fluoroquinolones, was present, and a high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was found in 37% and 46% of strains, respectively. colonization with vre remains low in hong kong. this result is supported by the low level of isolation of vre from infections in the region and may be attributable to low levels of vancomycin use. high-level aminoglycoside resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance are common, and continued monitoring for vre is suggested.

AB  == background/aims: enterococci have been implicated in persistent root canal infections but their role in the infection process remains unclear. this study investigated the virulence, phenotype and genotype of 33 endodontic enterococcal  isolates. methods: phenotypic tests were conducted for antibiotic resistance, clumping response to pheromone, and production of gelatinase, hemolysin and bacteriocin. genotype analysis involved polymerase chain reaction amplification of virulence determinants encoding aggregation substances asa and asa373, cytolysin activator cyla, gelatinase gele, gelatinase-negative phenotype ef1841/fsrc, adherence factors esp and ace, and endocarditis antigen efaa. physical dna characterization involved pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna, and plasmid analysis. results: potential virulence traits expressed  included production of gelatinase by enterococcus faecalis (n=23), and response to pheromones in e. faecalis culture filtrate (n=16). fourteen strains produced bacteriocin. five strains were resistant to tetracycline and one to gentamicin, whereas all were susceptible to ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fusidic acid, kanamycin, rifampin, streptomycin and vancomycin. polymerase chain reaction products encoding efaa, ace, and asa were detected in all isolates; esp was detected in 20 isolates, cyla in six isolates, but asa373 was never detected. the gelatinase gene (gele) was detected in all isolates of e. faecalis (n=31) but not in enterococcus faecium (n=2); a 23.9 kb deletion sequence corresponding to the gelatinase-negative phenotype was detected in six of the eight e. faecalis isolates that did not produce gelatinase. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analyses revealed genetic polymorphism with clonal types evident. plasmid dna was detected in 25 strains, with up to four plasmids per strain and a similar (5.1 kb) plasmid occurring in 16 isolates. conclusions: phenotypic and genotypic evidence of potential virulence factors were identified in endodontic enterococcus spp., specifically production of gelatinase and response to pheromones.

TI  == adhesion properties of enterococci to intestinal mucus of different hosts.
AB  == the adhesive capacity of selected enterococci to human, canine and porcine intestinal mucus was investigated in order to select for potential probiotic strains with good adhesive properties for human or animal use. the adhesion to the human intestinal mucus of the tested strains was found to range from log10 3.8 to log10 8.6 cfu per microtitre plate well. the highest adhesion to the human intestinal mucus was found among strains from horse faeces, dog faeces and dog feed. the adhesion to canine mucus was observed to range from log10 3.8 to log10  8.3 cfu/well, with the highest adhesive capacity among strains from dog faeces, horse faeces and dog's feed; on average log10 7.9, 7.3 and 7.0 cfu/well, respectively. isolates from dogs did not bind at higher levels to canine mucus than to human mucus. a strong correlation was observed for the adhesion to human  and canine intestinal mucus (p < 0.0001) and also between porcine and canine or human mucus (p < 0.05 for both). when comparing the adhesion of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, no statistical significant differences were observed for any of the tested mucus types. the tested enterococcus strains were found to exhibit a strain dependent on in vitro adhesion to human, canine and porcine intestinal mucus and did not exhibit host specificity in their adhesion, though some sources appeared to contain more adhesive strains than others. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the in vivo adhesion to intestinal mucus of a large number of enterococci from different sources.

TI  == genotypic and technological characterization of enterococci isolated from artisanal fiore sardo cheese.
AB  == a total of 118 enterococcal strains isolated from artisanal fiore sardo cheese were characterized technologically and genetically. the presence of potential virulence factors was also investigated. strains were classified as ec. faecium (84 strains), ec. durans (24 strains) and ec. faecalis (10 strains). rapd-pcr analysis with two different primers (m13 and xd9) confirmed species identification and proved useful for the detection of interstrain variations, especially among ec. faecium isolates. most strains could hydrolyse casein and had weak acidifying activity in milk. none of the isolates produced lipolytic reactions. gelatinase activity was observed in two strains of ec. faecalis and one strain of ec. durans. beta-haemolysis on horses' blood was never detected in  any of the strains, independently of species. most strains produced tyramine from tyrosine but none decarboxylated lysine, histidine or ornithine. overall, a wide  spectrum of resistance was observed. almost all strains were resistant to the aminoglycosides, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, neomycin, and to the semisynthetic penicillin, oxacillin, but resistance to vancomycin was not widespread among our strains: only one ec. faecium and one ec. durans strain were found to be vancomycin resistant. our results show a certain diversity in technological traits of the enterococcal strains isolated from artisanal fiore sardo, together with a low incidence of some potentially pathogenic traits of health concern.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus by the  vitek 2 system, and comparison with two nccls reference methods.
AB  == we evaluated the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). the results obtained with the vitek 2 system were compared to those obtained using two nccls  reference methods. the vitek 2 system produced mics for penicillin g, erythromycin and vancomycin that were very similar to those of the reference agar-dilution test with all results being within a twofold dilution. when mics of teicoplanin for these isolates were measured by the agar-dilution method and vitek 2 system, there was one 'very major' error and seven 'minor' errors. there  were no 'major' errors for any of the antibiotics tested. when the results obtained by the micro broth-dilution method were compared with those obtained by  the vitek 2 system, there was one 'very major' error for teicoplanin by the vitek 2 system, as was the case with the agar-dilution method. there were two 'minor' errors for erythromycin and seven 'minor' errors for teicoplanin. there were no 'major' errors for any of the antibiotics tested. the 35 vre strains identified phenotypically by the vitek 2 advanced expert system included nine of enterococcus faecalis and 23 of enterococcus faecium. neither enterococcus avium  nor enterococcus hirae were identified. a total of 32 phenotypes were classified  into 22 vana and 10 vanb strains. pcr genotyping demonstrated 23 vana+ and nine vanb+ strains. there were differences between the vitek 2 system results and those of pcr. overall, 54.3 % of the test results were obtained within 7 h. all mic values for the 35 vre isolates were determined within 13 h of completing incubation. the vitek 2 system is a simple method for accurately detecting vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus and can be used to rapidly determine mics.

TI  == vancomycin resistance, esp, and strain relatedness: a 1-year study of enterococcal bacteremia.
AB  == the prevalence of esp, a gene associated with infection-derived and outbreak strains, in enterococcal blood isolates from 2002 was determined. fifty-five of 137 (40.1%) enterococcus faecalis isolates, 30 of 58 (51.7%) e. faecium isolates, 1 of 1 e. raffinosus isolate, 0 of 4 e. gallinarum isolates, and 0 of 1 e. casseliflavus isolate were positive. esp wasn't associated with vancomycin resistance (vr) or clinical service. vr e. faecium isolates were less genetically diverse than vancomycin-susceptible strains. a large cluster of vr isolates, belonging to esp-positive e. faecium, was revealed. these data support the hypothesis that esp and vr may contribute to dissemination of particular clones.

AB  == a multiplex pcr assay was developed for detection of the six types of glycopeptide resistance characterized in enterococci and for identification of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis at the species level. primers targeting the genes vana, vanb, vanc, vand, vane, vang, and ddl of e. faecium and e. faecalis and nuc of s. aureus and a chromosomal portion specific to s. epidermidis were designed to allow amplification of fragments with various sizes. this specific and sensitive technique allows detection of glycopeptide-resistant strains, in particular methicillin-resistant s. aureus, that may escape phenotype-based automated rapid methods.

AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == towards the establishment and standardization of a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa.
AB  == the objective of this study was to establish a repeatable, standardized laboratory procedure for monitoring the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and food of animal origin in south africa, with reagents prepared in-house. the emergence of resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria can be limited by implementing a veterinary antimicrobial drug policy, in which inter alia systematic monitoring and prudent use play essential  roles. the bacteria included in this study represented three different categories, namely zoonotic bacteria (salmonella), indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) and veterinary pathogens (mannheimia haemolytica). thirty isolates of each species were collected with the aim of standardizing the laboratory methodology for a future national veterinary surveillance and monitoring programme. susceptibility to ten  selected antimicrobial drugs was determined by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. the method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used as the standard. multi-well plates containing varying dilutions of antimicrobial drugs and prepared in-house for mic determinations, yielded repeatable results. storage of  plates for 2 months at -70 degrees c did not influence results meaningfully. within this limited sample of bacteria, mic results did not indicate meaningful resistance against any of the ten selected antimicrobial drugs. the findings of the study will be used to establish a national veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa. to allow for international comparison of data, harmonisation of the surveillance and monitoring programme in accordance with global trends is encouraged. ideally it should be combined with a programme monitoring the quantities of antimicrobial drugs used. the aim is to contribute to slowing down the emergence of resistance  and the problems associated with this phenomenon by means of the rational use of  antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci of animal origin.
AB  == objective: we evaluated the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from animal farms and the potential relation of resistance to antimicrobial use. methods: enterococci from faecal samples from 18 beef cattle,  18 dairy cattle, 18 swine, 13 chicken, and eight turkey farms were prospectively  evaluated over a 6 year period from 1998 to 2003. results: we evaluated 1256 isolates of enterococcus faecium and 656 isolates of enterococcus faecalis. none  was vancomycin resistant. quinupristin/dalfopristin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin resistance rates in e. faecium were 2%, 0% and 55% in beef cattle, 8%, 7% and 47% in dairy cattle, 21%, 1% and 47% in swine, 85%, 12% and 23% in chicken, and 52%,  13% and 24% in turkey isolates, respectively. for e. faecalis, gentamicin resistance rates were 0% in beef cattle, 24% in dairy cattle, 37% in swine, 32% in chicken, and 29% in turkey isolates, whereas 12%, 9%, 21%, 64% and none of isolates from beef, dairy, swine, chicken, and turkey farms, respectively, were resistant to ciprofloxacin. quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance in e. faecium was more common on chicken and turkey farms using virginiamycin (p<0.0001 for both) compared with farms not using a streptogramin, gentamicin resistance was more common on dairy farms using gentamicin (p<0.0001) compared with farms not using this antibiotic, and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on turkey and dairy farms using enrofloxacin compared with those with no enrofloxacin use (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). for e. faecalis, gentamicin resistance was more frequently detected on dairy and swine farms using gentamicin (p<0.0001 and  p=0.0052, respectively) and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on beef farms using enrofloxacin (p<0.0001) compared with farms not using these antimicrobials. pfge showed multiple strain types with some clones common between animals of the same animal species. conclusions: this study shows the presence of a significant reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci among farm animals. resistance was more common on farms using antimicrobial agents.

TI  == successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. to evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for  osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). pathogens were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). after a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. during week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. during week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. we recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect  hematologic abnormalities. we conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive strains collected worldwide.
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide recently released for clinical use in the treatment of serious gram-positive infections in hospitalized patients. we evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against recently isolated multidrug-resistant gram-positive clinical strains. a total of 386 isolates were  selected from a large collection of strains from more than 70 centers located in  europe, north america, and south america. the strains were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in mueller-hinton broth with 50 mg/l ca++ against daptomycin. daptomycin was the most potent compound tested against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae with mic50/90 values at < or =0.12  and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. daptomycin was also highly active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcal strains with various resistance patterns. enterococcus faecium showed higher daptomycin mic values (mic90, 4 microg/ml) when compared to e. faecalis (mic90, 1 microg/ml). in summary, resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or penicillin among the gram-positive isolates did not adversely influence daptomycin activity. daptomycin showed a significant potency and spectrum against gram-positive species, including multidrug-resistant strains, and may represent a reasonable therapeutic option for infections caused by these important pathogens.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance in enterococci.
AB  == background: tolerance can be defined as the ability of bacteria to grow in the presence of high concentrations of bactericide antimicrobics, so that the killing action of the drug is avoided but the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) remains the same. we investigated vancomycin tolerance in the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from different clinical specimens. methods: vancomycin was obtained from sigma chemical co. we studied 100 enterococci strains. fifty-six and 44 of enterococcus strains were idendified as e. feacalis and e. faecium, respectively. to determine mics and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), we inoculated strains from an overnight agar culture to muller-hinton broth and incubated them for 4-6 h at 37 degrees c with  shaking to obtain a logarithmic phase culture. the inoculum was controlled by performing a colony count for each test. we determined mbc values and mbc/mic ratios to study tolerance to vancomycin. vancomycin tolerance was defined as a high mbc value and an mbc/mic ratio > or =32. results: fifty-six and 44 of the enterococcus strains were identified as e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. thirty-one e. faecium and 48 e. faecalis were found to be susceptible to vancomycin and these susceptible strains were included in this study. the mics of susceptible strains ranged from < or =1 to 4 mg/l, the mbcs were > or =512 mg/l.  tolerance was detected in all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains. the standard e. faecalis 21913 strain also exhibited tolerance according to the high mbc value and the mbc/mic ratio. we defined the tolerant strains as having no bactericidal  effect and mbc/mic > or =32. we found that a 100% tolerance was present in susceptible strains. conclusions: one of the hypotheses for tolerance is that tolerant cells fail to mobilize or create the autolysins needed for enlargement and division. our data suggests that tolerance may compromise glycopeptide therapy of serious enterococci infections. to add an aminoglycoside to the glycopeptide therapy unless mbcs are unavailable can be useful in the effective treatment of serious enterococcus infections.

AB  == the susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant (vre) and vancomycin-susceptible (vse) enterococci to 10 antimicrobial agents was evaluated. the strains, belonging to different species, were isolated in italy from raw meat products, farm animals, and human clinical infections in the years 1997-2000. high frequency of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was observed in all the groups of strains. on the contrary, chloramphenicol was the only drug that showed a relatively low rate of resistance in all the groups examined. in general, the resistance rates observed for vse did not differ from those observed for vre of the same species and origin. some differences could be noticed among the different enterococcal species, with enterococcus faecium strains being usually more resistant to beta-lactams, and enterococcus faecalis strains more resistant  to gentamicin. however, the strongest differences were observed when the strains  were compared according to their source, the human isolates being usually more resistant than the isolates of animal origin. no significant difference was observed between isolates of swine and poultry origin. among vre e. faecium, multiple resistance was much more frequent among the human strains (90%) than among poultry (48.9%) and swine (26.5%) strains. these results show that in italy vre isolates from human clinical infections are usually more resistant than isolates from meat products and farm animals, and possess different antimicrobial resistance profiles.

TI  == enterococcus gallinarum carrying the vana gene cluster: first report in brazil.
AB  == in 2000, enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin was first reported at a tertiary hospital in porto alegre, southern brazil. the resistance spread to other hospitals and surveillance programs were established by hospital infection  committees to prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. in february 2002, an isolate initially identified at the genus level as enterococcus was obtained by surveillance culture (rectal swab) from a patient admitted to a hospital for treatment of septic arthritis in the shoulder. the isolate proved to be resistant to vancomycin by the disc diffusion method and confirmed by an e-test resulting in a minimal inhibitory concentration of > or = 256 microg/ml. this isolate was sent to a reference laboratory (laboratorio especial de bacteriologia e epidemiologia molecular, faculdade de ciencias farmaceuticas de ribeirao preto, usp) for further study and proved to be an e. gallinarum by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using specific primers for the species. due to the phenotype of unusually high vancomycin resistance, the isolate presumably had the resistance genes (vana and vanb) and this was confirmed by pcr, which indicated the presence of the vana gene. a 10.8-kb tn1546-related transposon was  also identified by long-pcr. interspecies transfer of the vancomycin-resistance gene from the donor e. gallinarum was performed in a successful conjugation experiment in vitro, using e. faecium ge-1 and e. faecalis jh22 as receptors. this is the first report of the detection of a vana determinant naturally acquired by e. gallinarum in brazil, indicating the importance of characterizing  vre by both phenotype and genotype methods.

AB  == recently increase of enterococcal infections has been observed. these bacteria, mainly enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are members of the normal flora of gastrointestinal tract but also are typical opportunistic pathogens. enterococci are characterized by natural resistance to numerous antibiotics (among them cephalosporins), and also by easy acquired resistance to antibiotics. infections caused by multiresistant strains are difficult in treatment, chronic,  recurrent and sometimes fatal are described. enterococcal infections are caused often by e. faecalis, rarely by e. faecium. in the last years other species of enterococci have been isolated from different clinical materials (e. casseliflavus, e. avium, e. durans, e. gallinarum). the aim of this study was to  analyze the antibiotics susceptibility of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine of children with urinary tract infection (uti), hospitalized in the upper silesian health center of child and mother or treated ambulatory. susceptibility  of the 130 strains of e. faecalis and 41 e. faecium to: penicillin, tetracycline, high level of aminoglycoside (gentamycin 120 microg and streptomycin 300 microg), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin was  estimated. all isolated strains of e. faecalis (100%) were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and to nitrofurantoin, 96% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 43% to ciprofloxacin and 28% to tetracycline. all strains of e. faecium were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), 32% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 19% to tetracycline 14% to ciprofloxacin and 50% to nitrofurantoin. twenty two strains of e. faecalis (17%) and twelve strains of e. faecium (29%) were demonstrated high level resistance to aminoglycosides (hlar). among hlar strains of enterococci, were observed strains of high level resistance only to streptomycin, high level resistance only to gentamycin and high level resistance to both aminoglycosides.  the hlar strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium were also resistant to other antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. the most frequent cause  of child urinary tract infection was e. faecalis, with high sensitivity to penicillins, glycopeptides and nitrofurantoin. the increased role of e. faecium and other strains of enterococci also has been shown. these species demonstrated  sensitivity to glycopeptides, but resistance to other antibiotics, routinely used for treatment of uti as well as to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == [surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: vira study 2004].
AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  == in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic  infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary  lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus strains isolated from poultry faeces.
AB  == we have investigated the resistance of enterococcus isolated from poultry faeces  to antibiotics commonly used as therapy of enterococcal infections. identification was made by the method of facklam and collins. minimal inhibitory  concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined and high level aminoglycoside resistance was investigated. genes codifying high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) were determined by pcr. fifty five enterococcus strains were isolated (63.6% e. faecalis, 12.7% e. mundtii, 9.1% e. faecium, 7.3% e. casseliflavus, 3.7% e. durans and 3.6% e. hirae). none of the strains were resistant to van, tec, p or am. hlar was found in 34.5% of strains for sm, 27.3% for km and 7.3% for gm. the gene for the bifunctional enzyme was found only in one strain, that showed hlar to gm and km.  fourteen strains harboured the gene aph(3')-iii, being 11 resistant to km and str, and three resistant to gm, km and str. the remaining six strains showed hlar to str, but were negative for the three genes tested by pcr. the gene ant(4'4") was not detected in any of the strains. no unexpected vancomycin resistance was detected. the resistance rates among poultry strains were lower than those found  among human strains isolated from hospital patients in recent canary studies.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci recovered  from brazilian intensive care units.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of brasilia, brazil. conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. enterococcus faecalis (76%) and e. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species.  no enterococci showed the vana or vanb vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. only the intrinsically resistant species e. gallinarum (n=2) and e. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanc1 and vanc2/3, respectively. we found e. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). nine e. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the  minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were 16 microg/ml (n=6) and 32 microg/ml (n=3). among these ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those  isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis strains among different patients.

TI  == multiple-antibiotic resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from commercial poultry production environments.
AB  == the potential impact of food animals in the production environment on the bacterial population as a result of antimicrobial drug use for growth enhancement continues to be a cause for concern. enterococci from 82 farms within a poultry production region on the eastern seaboard were isolated to establish a baseline of susceptibility profiles for a number of antimicrobials used in production as well as clinical environments. of the 541 isolates recovered, enterococcus faecalis (53%) and e. faecium (31%) were the predominant species, while multiresistant antimicrobial phenotypes were observed among all species. the prevalence of resistance among isolates of e. faecalis was comparatively higher among lincosamide, macrolide, and tetracycline antimicrobials, while isolates of  e. faecium were observed to be more frequently resistant to fluoroquinolones and  penicillins. notably, 63% of the e. faecium isolates were resistant to the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin, while high-level gentamicin resistance was observed only among the e. faecalis population, of which 7% of the isolates were resistant. the primary observations are that enterococci can be frequently isolated from the poultry production environment and can be multiresistant to antimicrobials used in human medicine. the high frequency with which resistant enterococci are isolated from this environment suggests that these organisms might be useful as sentinels to monitor the development of resistance resulting from the usage of antimicrobial agents in animal production.

TI  == persistence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in new zealand broilers after discontinuation of avoparcin use.
AB  == large amounts of tylosin, zinc-bacitracin, and avilamycin are currently used as prophylactics in new zealand broiler production. avoparcin was also used from 1977 to 2000. a total of 382 enterococci were isolated from 213 fecal samples (147 individual poultry farms) using enrichment broths plated on m-enterococcus agar lacking antimicrobials. these isolates were then examined to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. of the 382 isolates, 5.8% (22 isolates) were resistant to vancomycin, and 64.7% were resistant to erythromycin. the bacitracin mic was > or =256 microg/ml for 98.7% of isolates, and the avilamycin  mic was > or =8 microg/ml for 14.9% of isolates. no resistance to ampicillin or gentamicin was detected. of the 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolates, 18 (81.8%) were enterococcus faecalis, 3 were enterococcus faecium, and 1 was enterococcus durans. however, when the 213 fecal enrichment broths were plated on m-enterococcus agar containing vancomycin, 86 vre were recovered; 66% of these isolates were e. faecium and the remainder were e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolates were found to have heterogenous pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns of smai-digested dna, whereas the pfge patterns of vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolates were identical or  closely related, suggesting that this vre clone is widespread throughout new zealand. these data demonstrate that vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis persists in the absence and presence of vancomycin-selective pressure, thus explaining the dominance of this vre clone even in the absence of avoparcin.

TI  == vand-type vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecium clinical isolates a902 and bm4538, which were resistant to relatively high levels of vancomycin (128 and 64 microg/ml, respectively) and to  low levels of teicoplanin (4 microg/ml), and enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates bm4539 and bm4540, which were resistant to moderate levels of vancomycin (16 microg/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin (0.25 microg/ml), were studied. they were constitutively resistant by synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending with d-alanyl-d-lactate and harbored a chromosomal vand gene cluster which was not transferable by conjugation to other enterococci. vanx(d) activity, which is not required in the absence of d-ala-d-ala, was low in the four strains, although none of the conserved residues was mutated; and the constitutive vany(d) activity in the membrane fractions was inhibited by penicillin g. the mutations e(13)g in the region of d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (which is implicated in d-ala1 binding in a902) and s(319)n of the serine involved in atp binding in bm4538 and  a 7-bp insertion at different locations in bm4539 and bm4540 (which led to putative truncated proteins) led to the production of an impaired enzyme and accounted for the lack of d-ala-d-ala-containing peptidoglycan precursors. the same 7-bp insertion in vans(d) of bm4539 and bm4540 and a 1-bp deletion in vans(d) of a902, which in each case led to a putative truncated and presumably nonfunctional protein, could account for the constitutive resistance. strain bm4538, with a functional vans(d), had a g(140)e mutation in vanr(d) that could be responsible for constitutive glycopeptide resistance. this would represent the first example of constitutive van gene expression due to a mutation in the structural gene for a vanr transcriptional activator. study of these four additional strains that could be distinguished on the basis of their various assortments of mutations confirmed that all vand-type strains isolated so far have mutations in the ddl housekeeping gene and in the acquired vans(d) or vanr(d) gene that lead to constitutive resistance to vancomycin.

TI  == the tyrosine decarboxylation test does not differentiate enterococcus faecalis from enterococcus faecium.
AB  == according to the current edition of the bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology [11] the tyrosine decarboxylation test allows the differentiation of enterococci. tyrosine is decarboxylated to the biogenic amine tyramine by e. faecalis and not by e. faecium strains. in the present study we sequenced the16s  rdna of two tyramine-producing strains, bifi-56 and bifi-58, presumptively classified as e. faecalis. their 16s rdna were identical to the same fragment from the e. faecium type strain. several e. faecium strains were then checked for their ability to decarboxylate tyrosine and also a putative tyrosine decarboxylase-coding gene was pcr amplified from these strains. all the strains confirmed as e. faecium produced tyramine and possessed a dna fragment coding for a putative tyrosine decarboxylase. the concordance of the two methods allows us to conclude that the tyrosine decarboxylase test cannot be used in the differentiation of e. faecalis from e. faecium since at least some e. faecium strains are tyramine producers.

TI  == clonal dissemination of vana-type glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecalis between hospitals of two cities located 100 km apart.
AB  == nosocomial dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci represents a major problem in hospitals worldwide. in brazil, the dissemination among hospitals in the city of sao paulo of polyclonal dna profiles was previously described for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. we describe here the dissemination of  vana phenotype e. faecalis between two hospitals located in different cities in the state of sao paulo. the index outbreak occurred in a tertiary care university hospital (hcusp) in the city of sao paulo and three years later a cluster caused  by the same strain was recognized in two patients hospitalized in a private tertiary care hospital (cmc) located 100 km away in the interior of the state. from may to july 1999, 10 strains of vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis were isolated from 10 patients hospitalized in the hcusp. the dna genotyping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed that all isolates were originated  from the same clone, suggesting nosocomial dissemination. from may to july 2002,  three strains of vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis were isolated from two patients hospitalized in cmc and both patients were colonized by the vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus in skin lesions. all isolates from cmc and hcusp were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the three strains from cmc had minimum inhibitory concentration >256 micro g/ml for vancomycin, and 64 (cmc 1 and cmc 2) and 96 micro g/ml (cmc 3) for teicoplanin, characterizing a profile of vana resistance to glycopeptides. all strains had the presence of the transposon tn1546 detected by pcr and were closely related when typed by pfge. the dissemination of the e. faecalis vana phenotype among hospitals located in different cities is of great concern because e. faecalis commonly colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of patients and healthy persons for periods varying from weeks to years, which, together with the persistence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in hospital rooms after standard cleaning procedures, increases the  risk of the dissemination and reservoir of the bacteria.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in us hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  == background: nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states. methods: data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis. results: our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus  (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days  for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans  group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.

AB  == imipenem is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for treatment of infections caused by enterococcus faecalis. however, there are no nccls guidelines for testing susceptibility of enterococci against imipenem. to assess  whether or not ampicillin or penicillin could be used as a surrogate for broth microdilution (bmd) testing of imipenem versus enterococcus species, 633 strains  of e. faecalis, e. faecium, and other enterococci isolated from blood cultures of patients at three geographically distinct university hospitals were tested by the nccls bmd and disk diffusion (dd) methods. using fda susceptibility breakpoints for imipenem and nccls breakpoints for penicillin and ampicillin, categorical agreement (ca) for penicillin-imipenem and ampicillin-imipenem tested with e. faecalis and e. faecium by bmd was >/=94% but was </=90% for other enterococci. using the dd method, ca for ampicillin-imipenem tested with e. faecalis and e. faecium was >/=98% and was 92% for other enterococci; ca for penicillin-imipenem  was 91% for e. faecalis, 98% for e. faecium, and 87% for other enterococci. further analysis showed that testing e. faecalis with ampicillin resulted in no false-susceptible (fs) or false-resistant (fr) results by bmd, no fs results by dd, and a single fr result by dd (0.2%), whereas testing with penicillin resulted in no fs results by bmd or dd and two fr results by bmd (0.4%). for e. faecium and other enterococci, the combination of fs and fr results was such that surrogate testing with penicillin or ampicillin appears not to be sufficiently reliable to be used clinically. we conclude that ampicillin is an accurate predictor of the in vitro activity of imipenem against e. faecalis.

TI  == sex pheromone response, clumping, and slime production in enterococcal strains isolated from occluded biliary stents.
AB  == bile-resistant bacteria, particularly gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, play an important role in biliary stent occlusion, because  their sessile mode of growth protects them against host defenses and antimicrobial agents. twelve e. faecalis and seven e. faecium strains isolated from occluded biliary stents have been investigated for slime production, presence of aggregation substance genes, and ability to adhere to caco-2 cells. ten isolates were strong producers of slime, and seven isolates produced clumps when exposed to pheromones of e. faecalis jh2-2 and/or og1rf. the small e. faecium clumps differed from the large clumps of e. faecalis and were similar to  those of e. faecium ls10(pbrg1) carrying a pheromone response plasmid. after induction with pheromones, the adhesion to caco-2 cells of clumping-positive strains was found to increase from two- to fourfold. amplicons of the expected size were detected in three clumping-positive and three clumping-negative e. faecalis isolates by using primers (agg) internal to a highly conserved region of the e. faecalis pheromone response plasmids pad1, ppd1, and pcf10 and primers internal to prgb of the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10. the agg/prgb-positive e. faecalis strains were also positive in southern hybridization experiments with a  prgb-specific probe. no pcr products were obtained with the same primers from four clumping-positive isolates (one e. faecalis and three e. faecium strains), which were also southern hybridization negative. our results demonstrate that slime production and pheromone response are both present in isolated enterococci, suggesting that clinical strains with these features might have a selective advantage in colonizing biliary stents.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == synthesis of mosaic peptidoglycan cross-bridges by hybrid peptidoglycan assembly  pathways in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the peptidoglycan cross-bridges of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis,  and enterococcus faecium consist of the sequences gly(5), l-ala(2), and d-asx, respectively. expression of the fmhb, fema, and femb genes of s. aureus in e. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic  side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. the fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional s. aureus factors such as trnas used for amino acid activation. the pbps of e. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and gly instead of l-ala at the n-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. low affinity pbp2a of s. aureus conferred beta-lactam resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the pbps.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

TI  == characterization of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci in kuwait hospitals.
AB  == this study investigated the distribution of genes for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ame) and the genetic relatedness of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant  enterococci isolated in kuwait hospitals. a total of 117 enterococci, consisting  of 109 enterococcus faecalis, seven enterococcus faecium, and one enterococcus casseliflavus were studied. the mics of gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were determined by agar dilution and the genes encoding the aac(6')- aph(2"), ant(4'), aph(3'), aph (2")-ib, aph (2")-ic, aph (2")-id, and ant(6) enzymes were amplified by pcr. they were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). filter mating was used to transfer gentamicin resistance determinants. they were all resistant to kanamycin (mic 2000 mg/l). fifty-five isolates were resistant to gentamicin (mic 500 mg/l), 72 were resistant to tobramycin (mic 64 mg/l), 115 were resistant to amikacin (mic 64 mg/l), and 97 were resistant to streptomycin (mic 1000 mg/l). the aac(6')-ie-aph(2")-ia was detected in all isolates with gentamicin mic 500 mg/l and in 15 isolates with gentamicin mic 256 mg/l. the aph(3')-iiia gene was detected in 101 isolates, whereas the ant(6')-ia gene was detected in 85 of the 97 streptomycin-resistant isolates with mic 1000 mg/l. the aac(6')-ii gene was detected only in the seven e. faecium isolates. none of them contained ant(4')-ia, aph(2")-ib, aph(2")-ic and aph(2")-id. pfge revealed heterogeneous patterns with no dominant clone. the results demonstrated that ame are common in  aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci isolated in kuwait. however, the absence of  a dominant clone suggests that they acquired high-level aminoglycoside independently.

TI  == [characteristics of enterococcus strains isolated from neutropenic patients at the national bone-marrow transplantation center of tunis].
AB  == the frequency of digestive colonization of neutropenic patients by enterococci during the phase of pre-transplant and post-transplant of bone marrow is important indeed as 441 enterococcus spp strains have been isolated from stool-cultures and other specimens whithin a period of 35 months in 80 patients.  a quantitative stool culture was done on appropriate media. simple bile-esculine  agar (be) and bile esculine-agar additionned with 6 mg/l of vancomycine (bev) were used for detecting enterococci. these organisms were taken into account, when then numeration was > 10(3) ufc/g of fecal sample on be and in all cases on  bev. species isolated were essentially enterococcus faecalis (39.4%), enterococcus faecium (34.4%) and enterococcus casseliflavus (17%). these strains  were characterized by a high frequency of high-level resistance to gentamicin (40.8%). resistance to amoxicillin concerns 40% of e. faecium strains. seventeen  multiresistant strains of e. faecium isolated from 7 patients (colonized during a long period and receiving a gut decontamination treatment) were the subject of a  phenotypic analysis (biotyping, antibiotyping and determination of mics to beta-lactam, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides). this analysis showed that these  strains are distinguishable, endogenic and specific for each patient, the common  multiresistance trait resulted from the selective pressure of decontamination treatment used for our patient.

TI  == lack of correlation between phenotypic techniques and pcr-based genotypic methods for identification of enterococcus spp.
AB  == a total of 123 genetically-unrelated strains of enterococcus spp. strains (51 enterococcus faecalis, 57 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum, and 5 enterococcus casseliflavus) were phenotypically identified by biochemical profiles and by using an automated method. the strains were also analyzed by a pcr assay to assess the accuracy of the phenotypically-based methods for identification of enterococcus spp. with this aim, a pcr assay using different cell targets, which allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide-resistant genotypes as well as identification to the species level by means of different gene targets, was used as the gold standard method. all 51 strains of e. faecalis were correctly identified, whereas 48 of 57 strains (84.2%) of e. faecium, were correctly identified. all of the strains of e. gallinarum and 3 out of 5 strains  of e. casseliflavus were also correctly identified. the overall results showed that it is possible to identify enterococcus spp. at the molecular level in less  than 30 hours, compared with the 48-96 hours required for the phenotypically-based methods. the excellent accuracy of the pcr assay in identifying these species, particularly e. faecium, must also be emphasized. these findings may have implications for the routine clinical identification of enterococci species.

TI  == microbial indicators for differentiation of human- and pig-sourced fecal pollution.
AB  == microbial indicators, the ratio of fecal coliforms (fc) to fecal streptococci (fs) and a newly defined enterococcus ratio, were used to differentiate pollution sources. fc fs values for municipal sewage were significantly higher than those values of the effluent from piggery wastewater. enterococcus ratio, the ratio of  (enterococcus durans + e. hirae) to (enterococcus faecalis + e. faecium), of human-sourced wastewater (0.90) was much lower than for pig-sourced wastewater (5.55). when fc/fs and enterococcus ratio were applied to a contaminated river study, both were corresponded well with the population density distribution of humans and pigs. fc/fs and enterococcus ratio are feasible microbial indicators for human- and pig-sourced wastewater pollution identification in field study.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of integrons in blood culture enterobacteriaceae  and gastrointestinal escherichia coli in norway and reporting of a novel class 1  integron-located lincosamide resistance gene.
AB  == background: class 1 integrons contain genetic elements for site-specific recombination, capture and mobilization of resistance genes. studies investigating the prevalence, distribution and types of integron located resistance genes are important for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and to understand resistance development at the molecular level. methods: we determined the prevalence and genetic content of class 1 integrons in enterobacteriaceae (strain collection 1, n = 192) and e. coli (strain collection  2, n = 53) from bloodstream infections in patients from six norwegian hospitals by molecular techniques. class 1 integrons were also characterized in 54 randomly selected multiresistant e. coli isolates from gastrointestinal human infections (strain collection 3). results: class 1 integrons were present in 10.9% of the enterobacteriaceae blood culture isolates of collection 1, all but one (s. typhi) being e. coli. data indicated variations in class 1 integron prevalence between hospitals. class 1 integrons were present in 37% and 34% of the resistant blood culture isolates (collection 1 and 2, respectively) and in 42% of the resistant gastrointestinal e. coli. we detected a total of 10 distinct integron cassette pcr amplicons that varied in size between 0.15 kb and 2.2 kb and contained between zero and three resistance genes. cassettes encoding resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides were most common. we identified and characterized a novel plasmid-located integron with a cassette-bound novel gene (linf) located downstream of an aada2 gene cassette. the linf gene encoded a putative 273 aa lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase resistance protein and conferred resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin. the deduced linf amino acid sequence displayed approximately 35% identity to the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis nucleotidyl transferases encoded by linb and linb' conclusions: the present study demonstrated an overall low and stable prevalence  of class 1 integron gene cassettes in clinical enterobacteriaceae and e. coli isolates in norway. characterization of the novel lincosamide resistance gene extends the growing list of class 1 integron gene cassettes that confer resistance to an increasing number of antibiotics.

TI  == enterococcal infections with special reference to phenotypic characterization & drug resistance.
AB  == background & objectives: enterococci, classified as group d streptococci, are the second leading cause of nosocomial infections. the incidence of enterococcal infections and species prevalent in india is not thoroughly investigated. the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize enterococci from clinical specimens and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these isolates. methods: clinical specimens (blood, urine and swabs) were cultured on bile esculin azide agar (beaa) for isolation of enterococci. the phenotype based scheme included gram staining of growth on beaa and subculturing  of cocci on sheep blood agar plates for vancomycin disk diffusion and hydrolysis  of l-pyrrolidonyl-beta-napthylamide (pyr) testing. the phenotypic method was used to surveillance cultures that yielded growth on beaa. enterococcal strains were further identified to the species level by conventional biochemical tests. pyr positive isolates were further characterized into vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) and nonvre depending upon vancomycin inhibition zone size. the  isolates were characterized into vana, vanb and vanc depending upon minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values. conventional method was used to study the  antibiogram of isolates. results: a total of 52 isolates of enterococci (10 enterococcus faecalis, 42 e. faecium) were isolated from 534 clinical specimens.  of the 52 isolates, 12 isolates were resistant to vancomycin with an mic > 4 microg/ml but sensitive to teicoplanin (vanb isolates). interpretation & conclusion: our study reveals the problem of multiple drug resistant enterococci  and emergence of vre. better susceptibility tests need to be used to measure the  vancomycin resistance accurately.

TI  == results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  == background: tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. objective: this study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (csssi). methods: this phase ii, randomized, open-label study was conducted between september 1999 and march 2001  at 14 investigative centers across the united states. patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg iv q12h for 7 to 14 days. the primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (ce) patients at the test-of-cure visit. secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (me) patients. also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus  faecium. tolerability assessments also were conducted. results: a total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were ce, and 91 were  me. the majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (sd) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. at the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% ci, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% ci, 60.3%-85.0%). in the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% ci, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% ci, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/ml for the selected pathogens. both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. nausea  and vomiting were the most common adverse events. conclusions: in this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with csssi. in patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.

AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == vancomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococci, predominantly enterococcus faecium, developed in the latter half of the 1980s, and the long anticipated development of vancomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus has now occurred. a number of vancomycin-intermediate strains have been described, and these strains have abnormal, thickened cell walls in the presence of vancomycin. two mechanisms of resistance have been described in the strains: affinity trapping of vancomycin molecules by cell wall monomers and clogging of the outer layers of peptidoglycan by bound vancomycin molecules, and change in the structure or metabolism of teichoic acids. of more serious concern has been the description in 2002 of two patients with vancomycin-resistant s aureus infections. in one instance, the patient had skin lesions coinfected with vancomycin resistant, vana genotype, e faecalis, and the vana resistance genes could have been transferred to the s aureus strain. expression of resistance was high in one s aureus strain and low in the other, making detection more challenging in the latter instance. these developments are of great concern, and every effort should be made to prevent further development and spread of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci.

AB  == between april 1, 1999 and june 30, 2000, 144 isolates of enterococci (one per patient) from cultures of several anatomic sites were collected. one hundred and  nineteen (82.6%) e. faecalis, 11 (7.6%) e. faecium and 14 (9.7%) of other species (5 e. raffinosus, 4 e. avium, 3 e. casseliflavus, 1 e. pseudoavium, and 1 e. dispar) were associated with clinical infections. the most common sites of isolation were: the urinary tract 54.9%, abdominal cavity 12.5%, surgical wounds  12.5%, abscesses 6.9% and diabetic foot 6.2%. high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin or both was detected in 48.6% of the isolates. e. faecium and e.  raffinosus were significantly more resistant than e. faecalis to ampicilin and imipenem. none of the strains exhibited beta-lactamase activity. one strain of e. faecium (0.7%) was resistant to vancomicin and teicoplanin (van a phenotype) and  two strains of e. casseliflavus (1.4%) showed low level of resistance to vancomicin (van c phenotype). because of these diverse antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, successful treatment and control of enterococcal infections with current antimicrobial agents are becoming increasingly difficult.

TI  == substantially increased faecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a  tertiary greek hospital after a 4 year time interval.
AB  == objectives: in a tertiary greek hospital with no documented vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) infections, a cross-sectional study was conducted in order to determine the degree of vre faecal carriage among adult patients hospitalized in  high-risk units. methods: specimens for the surveillance were collected from separate patients in two periods (january-may 1999 and january-may 2003); 258 specimens were submitted during the first period and 149 during the second period. results: three patients (1.2%) were colonized with vre during the first period, whereas 52 (34.9%) were colonized during the second period. two vre isolates of the first period were enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium, whereas those of the second period were e. faecium except for three e. faecalis and two enterococcus gallinarum. all vre isolates apart from the two e.  gallinarum isolates were positive for the vana gene. the 48 vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium were classified into eight clonal types, one of those predominating with 29 isolates; the remaining included one to nine isolates. the five vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis formed four distinct clonal types. conclusions:  the study reports a substantially higher prevalence of vre carriage when the surveillance was repeated after a 4 year time interval. urgent infection control  measures are needed to prevent emergence of vre outbreaks in our hospital setting.

TI  == [vancomycin resistant enterococci in the netherlands].
AB  == enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. for years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have increased dramatically, especially in the united states. in 2000, three outbreaks of vre occurred in hospitals in the netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. these measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of vre from multiple patients. all three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in dutch hospitals have been reported since then. epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of e. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. this 'hospital strain' of e. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired  vancomycin-resistance. current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant vre. the potential dangers of vre were recently underlined  by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from vre to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in two patients in the united  states. it is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of vre and mrsa in  dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.

TI  == selection of enterococci for potential canine probiotic additives.
AB  == enterococci are important inhabitants of animal intestine and are widely used in  probiotic products. a potentially successful probiotic strain is expected to have several desirable properties in order to be able to exert its beneficial effects. forty enterococcal isolates from dog faeces were tested for characters believed to be important for probiotic strains; bacteriocin production, resistance or tolerance to antibiotics, low ph, bile tolerance and adhesive activity. the total count of enterococci was found to be 3.3-7.3log(10)cfu/g of faeces. most identified strains were enterococcus faecium. all strains were sensitive to vancomycin, ampicillin, penicillin and chloramphenicol. thirty-three percentage of strains were resistant to erythromycin and 28% to tetracycline. among 40 isolates, 75% showed a broad inhibitory spectrum only against gram-positive indicator bacteria. seven strains with broad bacteriocin activity were selected for further assays. in the presence of 1% bile, the survival rate of selected strains ranged between 72 and 98%. survival of strains at ph 3.0 was found in the range between 76 and 87% after 3h. the adhesion of the tested strains to intestinal mucus ranged from 4 to 11% for canine mucus and from 5 to 8% for human mucus. e. faecalis ee4 and e. faecium ef01 showed the best probiotic properties.  it indicates that they could be used as new candidate probiotic strains after in  vivo testing.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == molecular confirmation of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium from clinical, faecal and environmental sources.
AB  == aims: the genus enterococcus includes opportunistic pathogens such as e. faecalis and e. faecium, and is also used to assess water quality. speciation of enterococci in environmental studies can be particularly problematic, therefore protocols for unambiguous, dna-based analysis could receive wide use in applications ranging from water quality monitoring to microbial source tracking.  the goal of this work was to investigate the usefulness of pcr for speciation of  putative, biochemically identified e. faecalis and e. faecium isolated from water, faeces and sewage. methods and results: putative enterococci (n = 139) were isolated on mei agar from dog, human, gull and cow faeces, and from sewage,  freshwaters and marine waters. a total of 128 isolates passed standard physiological tests for the genus, and were speciated by the api 20 strep (apistrep) biochemical test system. 42.2% were identified as e. faecalis, and all were confirmed by pcr. 19.5% were biochemically identified as e. faecium, but only seven were pcr-positive. conclusions: the 16s rdna of pcr-positive and pcr-negative e. faecium, including isolates that were inconclusively identified by apistrep, was sequenced. all formed a monophyletic clade with e. faecium sequences in genbank. significance and impact of the study: biochemical identification of e. faecalis agreed 100% with pcr assays, therefore a simple protocol of isolation on mei followed by pcr should be useful for environmental studies. discrepancies among biochemical identification, pcr confirmation and dna sequencing were noted for e. faecium, indicating that routine isolation/identification of e. faecium from environmental samples is a much more  difficult task.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species isolated from produce.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to characterize the antibiotic resistance profiles  of enterococcus species isolated from fresh produce harvested in the southwestern united states. among the 185 enterococcus isolates obtained, 97 (52%) were enterococcus faecium, 38 (21%) were enterococcus faecalis, and 50 (27%) were other enterococcus species. of human clinical importance, e. faecium strains had  a much higher prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and nitrofurantoin than e. faecalis. e. faecalis strains had a low prevalence of resistance to antibiotics used to treat e. faecalis infections of both clinical and of agricultural relevance, excluding its intrinsic resistance patterns. thirty-four percent of the isolates had multiple-drug-resistance patterns, excluding intrinsic resistance. data on the prevalence and types of antibiotic resistance in enterococcus species isolated from fresh produce may be used to describe baseline antibiotic susceptibility profiles associated with enterococcus spp. isolated from the environment. the data collected may also help elucidate the role of foods in the transmission of antibiotic-resistant strains to human populations.

TI  == prevalence of vancomycin and high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci among high-risk patients.
AB  == enterococci have been recognized as clinically important pathogens in high-risk populations of hospitalized patients. the role of enterococci in nosocomial infections is being recognized with increasing frequency. the main source of these infections is usually fecal carriage of the microorganisms. in this study,  gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) and high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci among 316 high-risk hospitalized  patients were investigated. one hundred and ninety-eight enterococci strains were isolated from stool specimens. all strains were identified to species level and 90 of the isolates were identified as enterococcus faecalis (45%), 85 as e. faecium (21.5%), 14 as e. avium (7%), 7 as e. raffinosus (3.5%), 1 as e. durans (0.5%) and 1 as e. hirae (0.5%). eleven of 198 strains were found to be moderately sensitive to vancomycin (mic: 8-16 microg/ml) by the agar dilution method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommendations, and the rest of these strains were found to be sensitive (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). twenty-eight strains showed high-level resistance to streptomycin (2,000 microg/ml) and 26 strains were found to have high-level resistance to gentamicin (500 microg/ml). twelve of these strains had high-level  resistance to both aminoglycosides. by the disk diffusion tests, 53 of 198 strains were found to be resistant to erythromycin, 51 to penicillin, 37 to ampicillin, 18 to ciprofloxacin, 14 to norfloxacin and 3 to nitrofurantoin. no beta-lactamase production was detected in 198 studied strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  == background: in our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. methods: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus  influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. results: moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. gatifloxacin was the most active against p. aeruginosa. moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of e. coli and h. influenzae. conclusions: moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. when treating infections caused by p. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.

TI  == genetic relatedness of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci isolated from poultry carcasses.
AB  == approximately 46% (75/162) or poultry enterococci collected between 1999 and 2000 exhibited high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] > or = 500 microg/ml), kanamycin (mic > or = 500 microg/ml), or streptomycin (mic > or = 1000 microg/ml). forty-one percent of the isolates were  resistant to kanamycin (n = 67), whereas 23% and 19% were resistant to genramicin (n = 37) and streptomycin (n = 31), respectively. the predominant species identified was enterococcus faecium (n = 105), followed by enterococcus faecalis  (n = 40) and enterococcus durans (n = 8). using polymerase chain reaction, the isolates were examined for the presence of 10 aminoglycoside resistance genes [ant(6)-ia, ant(9)-ia, ant(4')-ia, aph(3')-iiia, aph(2")-ib, aph(2")-ic, aph(2")-id, aac(6')-ie-aph(2")-ia, and aac(6')-ii]. five aminoglycoside resistance genes were detected, most frequently aac(6')-ii and ant(6)-ia from e.  faecium. seven e. faecalis isolates resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, or streptomycin were negative for all genes tested, indicating that additional resistance genes may exist. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates were genetically different with little clonality. these data indicate that enterococci from poultry are diverse and contain potentially unidentified aminoglycoside resistance genes.

TI  == increasing vancomycin susceptibility in vancomycin resistant enterococci by vanh  promoter and ddl transformation.
AB  == objectives: in vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) the vanhaxyz genes encode a new pathway of enzymes to produce d-alanyl-d-lactate. we investigated the effect  of vanh promoter and ddl gene transformation on vancomycin susceptibility in a vana phenotype of enterococcus faecalis. methods: to construct plasmid pjw1, the  vanh promoter was cloned to plasmid pam401. plasmid pjw2 was constructed by cloning the ddl gene into pam401. to construct pjw3, the ddl gene was ligated downstream of the vanh promoter of the plasmid pjw1. the competent vre was transformed with pjw1, pjw2 and pjw3 using electroporation. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of vancomycin for vre and transformed e. faecalis  was determined using the broth dilution method. the expression of the vana and ddl gene of vre and transformed e. faecalis was evaluated by rt pcr. results: the transformation of the vanh promoter reduced the vancomycin mic of vre. in vre and transformed e. faecalis, the vana and ddl genes were expressed. conclusions: this study presents a way of altering high-level vancomycin resistance with gene transformation in enterococci. in the future, development of an effective gene delivery system will contribute to the design of new modalities that will help overcome the limitations of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

AB  == objective: iso-sensitest agar (isa), which is recommended by the bsac for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci, contains insufficient calcium for testing daptomycin. isotonic agar supplemented with 50 mg/l calcium has been advocated, but is not routinely available in many laboratories. we evaluated a daptomycin etest that incorporates a constant level of calcium throughout the daptomycin gradient, designed to give an appropriate concentration around the strip during testing, as an alternative for susceptibility testing on  isa. methods: ninety-one isolates of staphylococcus aureus (45 methicillin-susceptible, 46 methicillin-resistant) and 90 enterococci (47 enterococcus faecalis, 43 enterococcus faecium) were tested. daptomycin etest mics were determined on isa, whereas agar dilution mics were determined in parallel on isotonic agar supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l as a control. results: the agar dilution and etest mic ranges of daptomycin for s. aureus were  0.25-1 mg/l (mode 0.5 mg/l), and 0.125-2 mg/l (mode 0.25 mg/l), respectively. the corresponding mic values for enterococci were 0.25-4 mg/l (mode, 1 mg/l) and 0.125-4 mg/l (mode, 2 mg/l). for staphylococci, 86% of the etest mic results were within one dilution of the agar dilution values, and for enterococci, 90% of the  etest mic results met these criteria. when results from the two methods were not  identical, there was a tendency for the etest mic values to be lower than the agar dilution values. conclusions: this study shows that calcium-supplemented daptomycin etests on isa are an accurate and convenient alternative to calcium-supplemented isotonic agar.

TI  == enterococcal infections: host response, therapeutic, and prophylactic possibilities.
AB  == the emergence of resistance against multiple antibiotics and the increasing frequency with which enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are isolated  from hospitalized patients underscore the necessity for a better understanding of the virulence mechanisms of this pathogen and the development of alternatives to  current antibiotic treatments. the genetic plasticity of enterococci and their ability to rapidly acquire and/or develop resistance against many clinically important antibiotics and to transfer these resistance determinants to other more pathogenic microorganisms makes the search for alternative treatment and preventive options even more important. a capsular polysaccharide antigen has recently been characterized that is the target of opsonic antibodies. a limited number of clinically relevant serotypes exist, and the development of an enterococcal vaccine based on capsular polysaccharides may improve our ability to prevent and treat these infections. additional enterococcal surface antigens, including abc transporter proteins and other virulence factors, such as aggregation substance (as), may also be useful targets for therapeutic antibodies.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to assess the phenotypic and genotypic taxonomic congruence in order to allow species allocation of dairy enterococci. a total of  364 enterococci isolated from ewes'milk and cheese from four portuguese registered designation of origin areas and 25 type and reference strains of enterococcus spp. were characterized by a polyphasic taxonomical approach involving 40 physiological and biochemical tests, whole-cell protein profiles, amplification of 16s-23s intergenic spacer regions (its-pcr) and subsequent restriction analysis (ardra). ribotyping was also performed with reference strains and a subset of 146 isolates. numerical hierarchic data analysis showed that single-technique identification levels increase from the physiological and biochemical tests to the protein approach, being lower with its/ardra and ribotyping. cross-analysis confirmed a higher unmatching level in all pairwise combinations involving physiological and biochemical data. whole-cell protein profiles followed by its/ardra identified 89% of the enterococci. reliable identification of enterococci from milk and cheese could be obtained by analysis  of whole-cell protein profiles. its-pcr can be used to confirm e. durans and e. faecium and ardra further confirms e. faecalis. results revealed e. faecalis, e.  durans, e. hirae and e. faecium as the prevalent species, although species prevalence showed some degree of variation among the areas.

TI  == a novel secreted endoglycosidase from enterococcus faecalis with activity on human immunoglobulin g and ribonuclease b.
AB  == the human pathogen enterococcus faecalis can degrade the n-linked glycans of human rnase b to acquire nutrients, but no gene or protein has been associated with this activity. we identified an 88-kda secreted protein, endoglycosidase (endo) e, which is most likely responsible for this activity. endoe, encoded by ndoe, consists of an alpha-domain with a family 18 glycosyl hydrolase motif and a beta-domain similar to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. phylogenetic analysis of endoe indicates that the alpha-domain is related to human chitobiases, and the beta-domain is related to bacterial and human hexosaminidases. recombinant expression of full-length endoe or endoealpha, site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic residues, mass spectroscopy, and homology modeling shows that endoealpha hydrolyzes the glycan on human rnase b, whereas endoebeta hydrolyzes the conserved glycan on igg. denaturation experiments indicate that the chitinase activity on rnase b is not dependent on the tertiary structure, although it is on igg. the ndoe gene and secreted endoe are present in most e. faecalis but not in  enterococcus faecium isolates. correspondingly, e. faecalis, but not e. faecium,  degrades the glycan on rnase b during growth. thus, we have identified a secreted enzyme from e. faecalis, endoe, which by two distinct activities hydrolyzes the glycans on rnase b and igg. both activities could be important for the molecular  pathogenesis and persistence of e. faecalis during human infections.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in chicken intestines and humans of korea.
AB  == the prevalence, genotype for antibiotic resistance and antibiotic susceptibility  of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) were determined. and molecular typings  of the enterococcus faecium isolates were analyzed. prevalence of vre in chickens, healthy children and intensive care unit (icu) patients was 41.6%, 7.9%, and 20.4%, respectively. forty out of 54 isolates from chicken intestines,  and 9 out of 11 from icu patients were identified as enterococcus faecium. eleven out of 13 isolates from non-hospitalized young children were e. gallinarium. twelve strains of e. faecalis were isolated from chicken intestines. the gene for the antibiotic resistance in e. faecium, and e. faecalis was vana, while that in  e. gallinarium was vanc1. e. faecium isolates were resistant to most of antibiotics except ampicillin and gentamicin. molecular typing of the e. faecium  strains obtained by pulse field gel electrophoresis and repetitive sequence-based pcr suggest that vre transmit horizontally from poultry to humans, especially young children, via the food chains in korea.

TI  == characterization of faecal enterococci from rabbits for the selection of probiotic strains.
AB  == aims: to characterize the facultative anaerobic intestinal microbiota of healthy  rabbits, especially enterococci, for the selection of potential probiotic strains. methods and results: phenotypic and molecular methods were used to identify enterococcal isolates. results obtained indicated that enterococcal microbiota widely varied among individuals both in size and in composition. antibacterial and haemolytic activities, and resistance to acid and bile salts were determined. a small group of strains produced bacteriocins active against listeriae and indigenous clostridia and therefore they were selected as potential probiotics. one such strain, 8g, was assayed for colonization capacity. results obtained suggested that the fate of the introduced strain depended on the composition of the enterococcal indigenous microbiota. conclusions: enterococcus  faecalis and ent. faecium are the predominant enterococcal species in the gut of  rabbits. other species of lactic acid bacteria were not recovered. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal intestinal microbiota of healthy rabbits has been characterized in detail. monitoring the fate of an introduced probiotic in vivo is required in order to evaluate potential probiotic strains.

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == prevalence and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from food.
AB  == in the present study, a collection of 187 enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from european cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (tc) resistance. a total of 45 isolates (24%) encompassing the species enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), e. durans (n = 7), e. faecium (n = 3), e. casseliflavus (n = 1), and e. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to tc with mic ranges of 16 to 256 microg/ml. eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to tc, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. by pcr detection, tc resistance could be linked to the presence of the tet(m) (n  = 43), tet(l) (n = 16), and tet(s) (n = 1) genes. in 15 isolates, including all of those for which the mic was 256 micro g/ml, both tet(m) and tet(l) were found. furthermore, all tet(m)-containing enterococci also harbored a member of the tn916-tn1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(b) gene. filter mating experiments revealed that  10 e. faecalis isolates, 3 e. durans isolates, and 1 e. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(m), tet(l), or both of these genes to e. faecalis recipient strain jh2-2. in most cases in which only tet(m) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by jh2-2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the tn916-tn1545 family. sequencing analysis of pcr amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the transferable tet(m) genes belonged to four sequence homology groups (shgs) showing an internal homology of  > or = 99.6%. two of these shgs contained tet(m) mosaic structures previously found in tn916 elements and on lactobacillus and neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two shgs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene.

AB  == we assessed the in vitro activities of daptomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (qd) against a contemporary challenge panel of 88 staphylococcal and 90 enterococcal isolates. the staphylococci selected included  vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus (visa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and coagulasenegative staphylococci. enterococcal isolates included vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) containing either vana, vanb1, or vand. the mics of daptomycin, linezolid, and qd were determined using commercial broth microdilution panels. all three visa isolates were susceptible to daptomycin, linezolid, and qd. qd was the most active agent against staphylococcal isolates (mic50 < or = 0.5 microg/ml and mic90 = 1 microg/ml), including those with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. qd was also the most active agent against vref (mic90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml). no differences were seen  for susceptibility of vana, vanb1, and vand vref strains for daptomycin, linezolid, or qd. daptomycin was the most effective against e. faecalis. on the basis of manufacturer-suggested interpretive criteria, 92% of isolates were susceptible (mic90 = 4 microg/ml). all isolates tested were susceptible to at least one antimicrobial agent for which interpretive criteria have been defined.  population analysis of three s. aureus isolates for which the daptomycin mics were 8 microg/ml showed a pattern of homogeneous resistance.

AB  == a total of 100 bacterial strains (25 escherichia coli, 25 salmonella enterica, 25 staphylococcus aureus, and 25 enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary  diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries using routine methodology. in addition, the 25 enterococcus strains were identified to species level. a total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. when the reported results were categorized according to the national committee of clinical laboratory standards  breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. for e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella, all laboratories except one had  more than 97% concordant results, whereas for enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. susceptibility testing of salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of s. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. ten laboratories identified the enterococcus spp. to species level. all five enterococcus faecium  and 10 enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the danish veterinary institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some  problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. this study showed  a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility  test results of e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella from animals in the nordic countries are comparable. but it also showed that some aspects can be improved. in addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying e. faecalis and e. faecium.

TI  == high antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in swedish icus. report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using ta90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  == local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 icus participating in the icu-strama programme. the median antibiotic consumption per icu was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (ddd1000).  antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (ta90). the mean number of ta90 was low (1-2 per organism) for enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:van), coagulase negative staphylococci (van), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:ctz, netilmicin: net) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (ctz, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: tsu), but higher (3-7) for acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:imi, net, tsu), enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:amp, imi, van), serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:cip, imi, net), enterobacter spp. (cip, imi, net, tsu), e. coli (cefuroxime:cxm, cefotaxime/eftazidime:ctx/ctz, cip, imi, net, piperacillin-tazobactam:ptz, tsu),  klebsiella spp. (ctx/ctz cip, imi, net, ptz, tsu) and staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, net, oxacillin, rifampicin, van). of s. aureus isolates 2% were mrsa. facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were  available in 96% of the icus. the numbers of ta90 available were apparently higher than in icus in southern europe and the us, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. this may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in swedish icus.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of ac98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial  agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == ac98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (ac98-1). in the present study the activity of ac98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. ac98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). ac98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (mic(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (mic(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). ac98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) cfu/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) cfu/ml). unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, ac98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. the potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by ac98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.

TI  == [the trend and susceptibility to antibacterial agents of enterococcus species from urinary tract infections].
AB  == objective: to determine the extent of drug-resistance among enterococcus species  we investigated in vitro experiments. methods: studies were carried out on pure cultured of enterococci isolated from 8,575 urine specimens between 1990 and 2002. we had determined test strains to three kinds of species, which posses the  urinary pathogenesis. both an ef-agars and an adh decarboxylase test performed the identification and speciation of the strains of enterococci. in vitro drug-susceptibility tests of enterococci were performed against the following antibiotics: ampicillin (abpc), cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), minocycline (mino), levofloxacin (lvfx), vancomycin (vcm), sulfamethoxazone/trimethoprim (st), by employing the method for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically recommended by japan society of chemotherapy. these drug-susceptibilities were shown susceptible, intermittent and resistant in according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m100-s12). results: the most common species isolated was e. faecalis (84.4%), followed by e. faecium (9.9%) and e. avium (5.6%). in e. faecium and e. avium, the sensitivity to abpc has tended to improve from 1999. this tendency inverse correlated to decreasing dosage of pcs. there was much difference of resistant rate to ipm/cs between each species, and no correlation to used dosage of cbps. the rate of resistance to mino did not change during this period. 60% of e. faecalis had sensitivity to lvfx and the rate did not change during this period. in e. faecium, whose resistant rate to lvfx was 90%, the sensitivity has been improved to over 25% from 2001. the improved tendency of e. faecium to lvfx has inverse proportion to decreasing dosage of nqs. with the exception of a little bit vre (vcm resistant enterococci), almost of them had sensitivity to vcm. conclusion: the emergence of enterococci with alarming rates of resistance concomitantly to multi-drugs highlights the need for a more rational and restricted use of antimicrobials, in order to minimize the selection and spread of such strains. an early detection of these problem pathogens is also important for preventing any treatment failures.

TI  == role of class a penicillin-binding proteins in pbp5-mediated beta-lactam resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == peptidoglycan polymerization complexes contain multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) of classes a and b that associate a conserved c-terminal transpeptidase module to an n-terminal glycosyltransferase or morphogenesis module, respectively. in enterococcus faecalis, class b pbp5 mediates intrinsic resistance to the cephalosporin class of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. to identify the glycosyltransferase partner(s) of pbp5, combinations of deletions were introduced in all three class a pbp genes of e. faecalis jh2-2  (pona, pbpf, and pbpz). among mutants with single or double deletions, only jh2-2 deltapona deltapbpf was susceptible to ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone resistance was restored by heterologous expression of pbpf from enterococcus faecium but not by  mgt encoding the monofunctional glycosyltransferase of staphylococcus aureus. thus, pbp5 partners essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of beta-lactams formed a subset of the class a pbps of e. faecalis, and heterospecific complementation was observed with an ortholog from e. faecium. site-directed mutagenesis of pbpf confirmed that the catalytic serine residue of  the transpeptidase module was not required for resistance. none of the three class a pbp genes was essential for viability, although deletion of the three genes led to an increase in the generation time and to a decrease in peptidoglycan cross-linking. as the e. faecalis chromosome does not contain any additional glycosyltransferase-related genes, these observations indicate that glycan chain polymerization in the triple mutant is performed by a novel type of  glycosyltransferase. the latter enzyme was not inhibited by moenomycin, since deletion of the three class a pbp genes led to high-level resistance to this glycosyltransferase inhibitor.

TI  == worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
AB  == continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the americas and europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. the general characteristics of this gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (oxa)-resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. the overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99%  of mic results were at < or =1 microg/ml. s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (mic90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and e.  faecium (mic90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, vre strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (mic50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). all streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. this reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. some vre were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; van b phenotypes). further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.

AB  == the occurrence, structure, and mobility of tn1546-like elements were studied in environmental vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated from municipal sewage, activated sludge, pharmaceutical waste derived from antibiotic production, seawater, blue mussels, and soil. of 200 presumptive vre isolates tested, 71 (35%) harbored vana. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis allowed the detection of 26 subtypes, which were identified as enterococcus faecium (n =  13), e. casseliflavus (n = 6), e. mundtii (n = 3), e. faecalis (n = 3), and e. durans (n = 1) by phenotypic tests and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. long pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (l-pcr-rflp) analysis of tn1546-like elements and pcr analysis of internal regions revealed the presence of seven groups among the 29 strains studied. the most common group (group 1) corresponded to the structure of tn1546 in the prototype strain e. faecium bm4147. two novel l-pcr-rflp patterns (groups 3 and 4) were found for e. casseliflavus strains. indistinguishable tn1546-like elements occurred in vre strains belonging to different species or originating from different sources. interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of vancomycin resistance to e. faecium bm4105 was demonstrated for e. faecalis, e. mundtii, and e. durans. this study indicates that vre, including species other than e. faecium and e. faecalis, are widespread in nature and in environments that are not exposed to vancomycin selection and not heavily contaminated with feces, such as seawater, blue mussels, and nonagricultural soil. tn1546-like elements can readily transfer between enterococci of different species and ecological origins, therefore raising questions about the origin of these transposable elements and their possible transfer between environmental and clinical settings.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis colonization during recovery from neisseria meningitidis cerebrospinal meningitis. case report.
AB  == a 19-year-old man had been admitted to the hospital because of septic shock and large scale suffusions all over the body. the pathogen had proved to be neisseria meningitidis serogroup c. in his stabilization period two superinfectious attacks arose. one of them was a bacteremia, caused by a vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecium. the second was a wound infection in his deep colliquating necrotised tissue of the heel. vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vref)  was isolated from this lesion with some gram-negative opportunistic pathogens. the strain contained the vana gene. after systemic and topical treatment, furthermore plastic surgical interventions the patient recovered. this is the second report on vref from hungary colonizing/infecting a patient with an underlying disease.

TI  == susceptibility patterns of enterococci causing infections.
AB  == enterococci are among the common organisms associated with hospital-acquired infections. we examined in vitro activities of different antibiotics to 103 enterococcal isolates. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of penicillin g,  ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin were determined by broth microdilution testing method. among the isolates 71 (69%) were identified as e. faecalis and 32 (31%) as e. faecium. while over 75% of e. faecium isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, approximately 25% of e. faecalis isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. none of the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. while 17 (52%) of e. faecium isolates exhibited high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr), high level streptomycin resistance (hlsr) was detected in 24 (74%) of the isolates. in contrast, hlgr and hlsr rates for e. faecalis were 14 (20%) and 22 (31%), respectively. both hlgr and hlsr were detected with higher frequency in ampicillin resistant isolates. among fluoroquinolones, gemifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most potent antibiotics tested. there was no increase in mic90 values of the fluoroquinolones in ampicillin resistant isolates in comparison with ampicillin susceptible isolates. our data suggest newer fluoroquinolones would be good alternative agents to use especially for combination drug therapy where enterococci with ampicillin resistance and hlar are prevalent.

AB  == the in vitro effects of levofloxacin and vancomycin in combination were evaluated against high level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococci using chequerboard and time-kill curve techniques. we examined 28 strains of enterococci comprising  17 enterococcus faecalis, 10 e. faecium and one e. durans. the combination of vancomycin and levofloxacin had indifferent activity against all isolates according to chequerboard microdilution method, but was synergistic for two isolates, one e. faecium and one e. faecalis, using the time-kill curve method. both strains were levofloxacin resistant and had high level aminoglycoside resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin. antagonism was not detected in any strain. the results of this study suggested that the combination of vancomycin with levofloxacin does not often show synergistic effect against high level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.

AB  == the in vitro activity of abt773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens  and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. abt773 was active (mic-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were also inhibited (mic-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to abt773 with the exception of vana mutants. e. faecium showed poor susceptibility  to abt773. the activity of the new ketolide against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. abt773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.

TI  == a novel putative enterococcal pathogenicity island linked to the esp virulence gene of enterococcus faecium and associated with epidemicity.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis harbors a virulence-associated surface protein encoded by the esp gene. this gene has been shown to be part of a 150-kb putative pathogenicity island. a gene similar to esp has recently been found in enterococcus faecium isolates recovered from hospitalized patients. in the present study we analyzed the polymorphism in the esp gene of e. faecium, and we  investigated the association of esp with neighboring chromosomal genes. the esp gene showed considerable sequence heterogeneity in the regions encoding the nonrepeat n- and c-terminal domains of the esp protein as well as differences in  the number of repeats. dna sequencing of chromosomal regions flanking the esp gene of e. faecium revealed seven open reading frames, representing putative genes implicated in virulence, regulation of transcription, and antibiotic resistance. these flanking regions were invariably associated with the presence or absence of the esp gene in e. faecium, indicating that esp in e. faecium is part of a distinct genetic element. because of the presence of virulence genes in this gene cluster, the lower g+c content relative to that of the genome, and the  presence of esp in e. faecium isolates associated with nosocomial outbreaks and clinically documented infections, we conclude that this genetic element constitutes a putative pathogenicity island, the first one described in e. faecium. except for the presence of esp and arac, this pathogenicity island is completely different from the esp-containing pathogenicity island previously disclosed in e. faecalis.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

AB  == a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%.  however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis,  the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.

AB  == the use of avoparcin as a growth promoter is considered to have selected for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). in costa rica, the use of avoparcin for poultry and swine was intensive until the product was withdrawn from the market in 2000. we evaluated the presence of vre in poultry, swine, and cattle fecal samples obtained during 1998 and 1999. a total of 185 vre isolates were recovered from 116 out of 893 samples. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species (50.8%), being predominant among poultry (71.6%) and swine (37.7%) isolates, but it was not recovered from the bovine samples. the second-most-frequently-isolated species from poultry and swine, respectively, were e. durans (23.2%) and e. faecalis (21.7%). e. casseliflavus was the only species obtained from bovine samples, but it was not found among the avian isolates. an evident predominance of the vana determinant among vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species from poultry and swine, but not from cattle, was observed and was similar to the situation in european countries before avoparcin was forbidden. the diversity of the vana determinant in the isolates was assessed by detection of the is1251 insertion in the vansh intergenic region and of the is1476 insertion in the vanxy intergenic region. however, in none of the 154 vana+ isolates recovered in this study were those insertions detected.

AB  == bacterial genes of tyrosine decarboxylases were recently identified. here we continued the sequencing of the tyrosine decarboxylase locus of lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809 and determined a total of 7979 bp. the sequence contained four complete genes encoding a tyrosyl-trna synthetase, the tyrosine decarboxylase, a  probable tyrosine permease and a na+/h+ antiporter. rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) was employed to determine the 5'-end of mrnas containing the tyrosine decarboxylase gene. it was located only 34-35 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, suggesting that the preceding tyrosyl-trna synthetase gene was transcribed separately. in contrast, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rt-pcrs) carried out with primers designed to amplify regions spanning gene junctions showed that some mrnas contained the four genes. homology searches revealed similar clusters of four genes in the genome sequences of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. phylogenetic analyses supported the hypothesis that these genes evolved all together. these data suggest that bacterial tyrosine decarboxylases are encoded in an operon containing four genes.

TI  == bactericidal activity and synergy studies of bal9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == bal9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. bal9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (mic/4). bal9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, bal9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no bal9141 inhibition was observed of  ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the activity of bal9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. bal9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against enterococcus faecalis and some e. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 cfu/ml), but static effects were also noted. drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). bal9141 (< or = 8 mg/l) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in swine and chickens fed virginiamycin for growth promotion.
AB  == in a prospective controlled study, we evaluated pigs (5-month period) and chickens (11-week period) fed subtherapeutic levels of virginiamycin. a total of  13 enterococcus faecium were isolated from 10 pigs and 17 from 8 chickens. there  were 8 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns in e. faecium isolates from pigs and 17 from chickens. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance occurred in 2 of 13 e. faecium from pigs and 2 of 17 e. faecium from chickens. there were no strains exhibiting high-level gentamicin (mic> or =2000 microg/ml) or vancomycin resistance. there was no relative weight gain in animals that received virginiamycin. the mean weight increase for the pigs in the group fed virginiamycin was 107.6 lb vs. 126.4 lb in the group that did not receive virginiamycin (p=n.s.). chickens fed virginiamycin had a mean weight increase of  1672 g vs. 1886 g in the group that did not receive virginiamycin (p=n.s.). there was no correlation between receipt of virginiamycin or weight gain and presence of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant strains.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
AB  == presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening.  we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of  animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we  isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains),  enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e.  faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.

TI  == species identification and detection of vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci of animal origin by multiplex pcr.
AB  == a multiplex pcr assay for the differentiation of species and detection of vancomycin (van) resistance genes in enterococci was established. three hundred sixty-seven enterococcal strains isolated from food were selected from a sample collection and were examined with regards to the existence of four vancomycin resistance genes (vana, vanb, vanc1 and vanc2) and to species differentiation (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum) by multiplex pcr. apart from unambiguous results for the majority of strains, the e. faecium specific primers used here, showed weak points in the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. despite these rare instances, we succeeded in optimising the multiplex pcr assay by variation of annealing temperature and primer combination. the assay presented here, with its optimised parameters, is therefore suitable for routine use and because of time and material saving, it is an alternative and rapid method in comparison to conventional tests.

TI  == comparison of the incidence of virulence determinants and antibiotic resistance between enterococcus faecium strains of dairy, animal and clinical origin.
AB  == enterococci are part of the dominant microbiota of several dairy products. they are also present in the gut of humans and animals. their presence in traditional  raw milk cheeses is probably due to faecal contamination of milk during milking.  due to their importance as a cause of nosocomial infections, enterococci are acquiring increased significance. such infections are becoming more and more difficult to treat as resistance to antibiotics increases. the aim of this investigation was to compare the potential virulence of enterococcus faecium isolated from different ecological habitats and to establish if strains isolated  from dairy products should really be considered as potential pathogens. in the present work, the antibiotic resistance pattern of 40 e. faecium strains isolated from dairy products, 26 e. faecium isolated from ewes' faeces and 28 clinical isolates of the same species was studied, and checks were made to see if known virulence determinants were present. resistance to 12 different antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of human infections was tested using the broth microdilution method as described by the nccls. in addition, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests were carried out to see if genes for vancomycin resistance were present. the presence of the aggregation substance (as) gene, the surface protein gene esp, the accessory colonisation factor ace, the enterococcus faecalis endocarditis antigen efaa and the gelatinase gele gene, which are involved in the virulence of enterococci, were also tested by pcr. the results of this study clearly indicate that e. faecium strains isolated from both cheese and sheep faeces are less pathogenic than those isolated from clinical samples. a similar pattern of resistance to antibiotics was observed in both dairy and animal strains. it was also found that there was difference in the kind of virulence determinants present in dairy and clinical isolates, while no virulence traits were found in sheep faeces strains. the results of this study suggest that e. faecium from traditional sardinian raw milk cheeses should not be considered to be the main source of untreatable nosocomial enterococcal infections in humans in the island of sardinia.

TI  == safety aspects of enterococci from the medical point of view.
AB  == enterococci occur in a remarkable array of environments. they can be found in soil, food, and water, and make up a significant portion of the normal gut flora  of humans (10(5)-10(7)/g of stool) and animals. as other bacteria of the gut flora, enterococci can also cause infectious diseases. most clinical isolates are enterocococus faecalis, which account for 80-90% of clinical strains. enterocococus faecium accounts for 5-10% of such isolates. typical enterococcal infections occur in hospitalised patients with underlying conditions representing a wide spectrum of severity of illness and immune modulation. enterococci today rank second to third in frequency among bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients. they are isolated from urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal and pelvic infections, bacteremias, wound and tissue infections, and endocarditis--often as part of a polymicrobial flora. surprisingly, little is known about the factors that contribute to the ability of enterococci to cause infections. many strains of e. faecalis produce a cytolysin (haemolysin) exhibiting tissue-damaging capacity. further extracellular products often observed in clinical isolates are a proteinase (gelatinase), hyaluronidase, and extracellular superoxide. furthermore, many of the clinical isolates possess the  aggregation substance on the surface and an extracellular surface protein, both contributing to the adherence to eucaryotic cells. some strains of e. faecalis, and many e. faecium strains are resistant to multiple antimicrobials. the ultimate role of all these factors in enterococcal pathogenicity remains to be determined. it was previously thought that enterococcal infections were endogenously acquired from the patient's own gut flora. a rather new concept that has emerged is that enterococcal disease is a two-stage process. there is an initial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract by enterococcal strains possessing virulence traits and/or antibiotic resistance. subsequently, this population spreads, often facilitated by antibiotic elimination of competitors. for a selected number of patients, there is subsequent tissue invasion from the gastrointestinal tract reservoir. from this concept, it can be deduced that enterococcal strains without virulence traits and antibiotic resistances exogenously transferred into the human gut via food products or probiotics will not represent any risk for immunocompetent individuals. in very severely immunocompromised patients, however, a risk for enterococcal disease by such strains cannot completely be excluded.

TI  == glucose prevents citrate metabolism by enterococci.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis fair e-239, growing on glucose plus citrate, metabolized citrate at ph 6.5 or 7.5, but only when glucose had been exhausted; it did not metabolize citrate at ph 5.5 or 8.5. when grown on citrate only, the strain metabolized citrate at all ph values, and two growth rates were apparent. citrate was mainly metabolized during the second, much slower growth rate. glucose also inhibited citrate metabolism by e. faecalis fair e-237 and fair e-259 and enterococcus faecium fair e-338 and fair e-371. glucose-grown resting cells were  unable to metabolize citrate. citrate-grown resting cells had a ph optimum of 4.7 for citrate metabolism but also metabolized significant amounts of citrate at ph  4.2 and 6.5. resting stationary phase cells used citrate more rapidly than resting log phase cells. citrate metabolism was faster at citrate levels <10 mm than above 10 mm. these results suggest that some form of catabolite repression is occurring.

TI  == the pheneplate system for studies of the diversity of enterococcal populations from the food chain and the environment.
AB  == the growing interest in ecological investigations, such as studies of the "flow"  of bacteria through the food chain, has resulted in a great need for simple typing techniques for bacteria that can be used when a large number of isolates need to be analysed. the present study describes a simple method for biochemical  fingerprinting of enterococci, the pheneplate rf (php-rf) system. the system is based on a 96-well microplate containing eight sets of 11 dehydrated reagents, selected to have a high discriminatory power among enterococcal isolates. the php plates are inoculated easily by picking single colonies directly from the primary agar culture and suspending them in the first well of each row in the microplate. the kinetics of each reaction is evaluated by measuring the absorbance value of each well three times during 64 h, whereupon a biochemical fingerprint is calculated as the mean value for each reagent over the three readings. the php-rf method was shown to be highly reproducible, even when results were compared between different laboratories. the discriminatory power, measured as simpson's diversity index (di), was as high as 0.96 for all enterococci. the php-rf method  could also be used as a preliminary species identification method, by comparing the biochemical fingerprints of unknown strains to those of a set of reference strains of known species. most strains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus hirae were correctly identified using this method. we conclude that the pheneplate rf system is useful for rapid typing of enterococcal populations, and it is especially useful as a first screening method for ecological studies, when many isolates per sample need to be analysed.

TI  == comparison of enterococcal populations in animals, humans, and the environment--a european study.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to generate knowledge of enterococcal populations in the food chain, by studying the population structure (in measures  of abundance and diversity) among enterococci in different geographical regions and in different parts of the food chain, as well as the similarities between different enterococcal populations. altogether, 2868 samples were collected from  humans (healthy and hospitalised individuals and clinical isolates), animals (slaughterhouse carcasses and farm animals), and the environment (pig farms, sewage, and surface water) in four european countries-sweden, denmark, uk, and spain. the samples were characterised with regard to presence and numbers of enterococci, and eight (for faecal samples) or 24 (for environmental samples) isolates per sample were phenotyped and preliminarily identified with the php-rf  system. in total, more than 20,000 isolates were typed. a majority of the samples (77%) showed the presence of presumed enterococci. the diversities of enterococci in environmental samples were generally high, and also faecal samples normally showed presence of more than one enterococcal strain. the most common species found were enterococcus faecium (33%), e. faecalis (29%), and e. hirae (24%), but different enterococcal populations differed in their species distribution. clinical isolates, hospitalised patients, and hospital sewage in sweden showed a  clear dominance of e. faecalis (80%, 57%, and 54%, respectively) whereas healthy  individuals and urban sewage contained less e. faecalis (39% and 40%, respectively). the species distribution among isolates from slaughterhouses varied between animal species and also between countries, but e. faecalis seemed  to be mainly associated with broiler, and e. hirae with cattle and pigs. the results from the study have indicated a simplified method to study the diversity  of bacterial populations. instead of collecting many samples and analysing one or a few isolates per sample, it is possible to collect fewer samples and analyse several isolates per sample. both approaches yielded similar information on the diversity of the populations. another useful information was that since samples from hospital sewage, urban sewage, and manure contained enterococcal populations that reflected those in faecal samples of hospitalised patients, healthy humans,  and animals, respectively, such samples may be used as pooled faecal samples and  may replace cumbersome samplings from many individuals.

TI  == taxonomy, ecology and antibiotic resistance of enterococci from food and the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == apart from genotypic identification methods, there is a need for reliable conventional phenotypic identification schemes for simple and rapid determination of enterococcal species in food or in the gastro-intestinal tract (git). only a limited number of enterococcal species is of importance for the ecology of the git or the food microflora, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans/hirae, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. after genus identification the differentiation within these species can include, e.g. mannitol and arabinose fermentation and growth at 50 degrees c. widely used commercial identification systems may fail to precisely identify rare species. ecological aspects should also be taken into account. in the human git e. faecium is the most common species whereas in most animal species e. faecalis is at least present in the same amount. especially in foods of animal origin (cheese, pork meat, beef, poultry meat) also e. faecalis is very frequent. this is of special interest as glycopeptide resistance is most often found in human clinical e. faecium strains  as well as in e. faecium from the environment or animal samples and less frequent in e. faecalis strains. eu experts propose as safety criteria for probiotics in feed additives the exclusion of resistances or the lack of transferability. this  proposal can also be applied to enterococci in foods. specific resistances must be excluded, but transferability or acquisition of resistance (e.g. vancomycin) cannot be excluded per se. however, technologically used strains should differ from clinical strains concerning their resistance patterns and transfer rates.

TI  == enterococci in foods--a conundrum for food safety.
AB  == enterococci form part of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) of importance in foods. they can spoil processed meats but they are on the other hand important for ripening and aroma development of certain traditional cheeses and sausages, especially those produced in the mediterranean area. enterococci are also used as human probiotics. however, they are important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and other infections. some strains are resistant to many antibiotics, but antibiotic resistance alone cannot explain the virulence of some of these bacteria. virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins and haemolysin have been described. the role of enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or as probiotics. studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal strains isolated from food showed that some harbour virulence traits and generally, enterococcus faecalis harbours more of them than enterococcus faecium. regulations in europe stipulate  that safety of probiotic or starter strains is the responsibility of the producer; therefore, each strain intended for such use should be carefully evaluated. for numerous questions, immediate answers are not fully available. it  is therefore suggested that when considering an enterococcus strain for use as a  starter or probiotic culture, it is imperative that each particular strain should be carefully evaluated for the presence of all known virulence factors. ideally,  such strains should harbour no virulence determinants and should be sensitive to  clinically relevant antibiotics. in general, e. faecium appears to pose a lower risk for use in foods, because these strains generally harbour fewer recognised virulence determinants than e. faecalis. generally, the incidence of such virulence determinants among e. faecium strains is low, as compared to e. faecalis strains, probably as a result of the presence of pheromone-responsive plasmids.

AB  == objective: to determine linezolid concentrations in peritoneal dialysis fluid after multiple oral doses of the drug in a 46-year-old man with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium peritonitis who was undergoing peritoneal dialysis. methods: after administration of oral linezolid 600 mg twice/day was started, peritoneal dialysis fluid was collected at the end of several 4- and 8-hour dwell times and submitted for analysis of linezolid concentration. before linezolid therapy was begun, and immediately after several  peritoneal dialysis exchanges, 30 ml of expended peritoneal dialysis fluid was collected in a sterile container and immediately frozen at -70 degrees c until analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. results: peritoneal dialysis  concentrations of linezolid greater than 4 microg/ml were achieved after the first dose of linezolid and maintained after repeated doses. during the course of therapy, mean linezolid concentrations in peritoneal dialysis fluid tended to increase (mean 7.60 pg/ml, range 3.54-16.2 microg/ml). all assayed peritoneal dialysis samples demonstrated linezolid concentrations greater than 4 microg/ml at the end of 4- or 8-hour dwell times, except for one level after a missed dose  on linezolid treatment day 3. duration of dwell times did not appear to correlate with linezolid concentrations. conclusion: in this patient, linezolid 600 mg twice/day penetrated into peritoneal dialysis fluid at or above the concentrations necessary to treat common gram-positive bacteria. linezolid therapy is likely to have a role in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis based on its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, ease of administration, and tolerability.

AB  == daptomycin efficacy against clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and a lab-derived daptomycin-resistant isolate of e. faecalis was investigated in a mouse model of renal infection. the daptomycin mics against these enterococci ranged from 0.5 to 50 micro g/ml. the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the mics of drugs against e. faecalis and e. faecium and the level of daptomycin exposure needed to evaluate the drug's efficacy. correlating the required therapeutic exposures of mice with  the exposures achieved clinically allowed us to project enterococcal breakpoint values. mice pretreated with carrageenan were infected intravenously with 3 x 10(8) to 4 x 10(8) cfu of e. faecalis or e. faecium. daptomycin (5 to 50 mg of drug/kg of body weight) or saline control was administered 4 h postinfection and  continued once daily for 2 days (three total doses). on day 4, infected kidneys were harvested, homogenized, and dilution plated. efficacy was defined as a > or  = 2-log(10) (99%) reduction in bacterial burden in infected kidneys. at clinically relevant dosages and exposures (area under the curve, 400 to 600 microg.hr/ml), daptomycin demonstrated similar and marked efficacy against all clinical enterococcal isolates tested. daptomycin achieved efficacy with comparable doses against both vancomycin-sensitive (mic, < or = 4 microg/ml) and  -resistant enterococcal strains tested. efficacy was also established against the lab-derived daptomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolate. in this murine renal infection model, clinically relevant exposures of daptomycin were effective against e. faecalis and e. faecium strains for which mics were < or = 8 microg/ml. these murine efficacy data for daptomycin, along with surveillance data and human pharmacokinetic exposures achieved, suggest a breakpoint concentration value of < or = 8 microg/ml (susceptible) and > or = 16 microg/ml (resistant) for daptomycin against e. faecium and e. faecalis.

AB  == to describe the clinical features and outcome of enterococcal meningitis, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 39 cases seen at 2 tertiary hospitals during a 25 years and collected 101 additional, previously reported cases for review. among these 140 cases, there were 82 cases (59%) of postoperative meningitis and 58 cases (41%) of spontaneous meningitis. eighty-six patients (61%) were adults and 54 (39%) were children. patients with spontaneous meningitis had a higher frequency of community-acquired infection (50% versus 18%; p < 0.01), severe underlying diseases (67% versus 22%; p < 0.01), and associated enterococcal infection (29% versus 8%; p < 0.01) than patients with postoperative meningitis. the clinical presentation was similar in both groups, but patients with spontaneous infection had a higher frequency of bacteremia (58% versus 12%; p < 0.01), and a lower frequency of mixed infection (9% versus 29%; p < 0.01). spontaneous meningitis in children was associated with a significantly lower frequency of fever, altered mental status, headache, and meningeal signs (p < 0.01), probably explained by the high proportion of neonates in this age-group. most infections were caused by enterococcus faecalis, which accounted for 76% of  the isolates identified at the species level. fifteen of the 25 cases due to enterococcus faecium were produced by vancomycin-resistant strains. most patients were treated with ampicillin, penicillin, or vancomycin, with or without aminoglycosides, for a median period of 18 days (range, 1-85 d). overall mortality was 21%. the mortality rate was higher in spontaneous than in postoperative meningitis (33% versus 12%; p < 0.01), but was similar in patients  treated with beta-lactams (18%), glycopeptides (14%), or other antibiotics (25%), as well as in patients treated with monotherapy (16%) or combination therapy (22%). an adverse outcome correlated significantly with advanced age, the presence of severe underlying diseases, associated enterococcal infection, bacteremia, septic shock, and the absence of fever at presentation. shunt removal was associated with a lower mortality. multivariate analysis showed that the presence of severe underlying diseases was the only prognostic factor associated  with mortality (odds ratio = 6.8, 95% confidence intervals = 2.7-17.5, p < 0.01).

TI  == molecular characterization of van genes found in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. isolated from the hospital das clinicas, fmusp, sao paulo, brazil.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (vre) is an important pathogen related with hospital infections in many countries, presenting limited or no therapeutic  options for treating serious infections. vre has presented some different genotypes been vana and vanb considered to be the most important in hospital environments. in the present study the authors investigated the prevalence of van genes (a, b an c) among clinical isolates of vre in a five month period at a large tertiary hospital in sao paulo, brazil. the results showed the presence of  vana, but not vanb or vanc in all 43 strains of e. faecalis and five e. faecium studied. the results bring an important issue, due to the possibility of resistance spread of vana genes, to be monitored and solved by the hospital infection control team and the microbiology and molecular biology laboratories at tertiary hospitals.

TI  == role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive nosocomial infections in haematological or oncological patients.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens, primarily staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, are now the predominant causes of infection in neutropenic haematology/oncology patients, but are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. glycopeptides have been the only alternative antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections to date. however, glycopeptides are not always effective or well tolerated, and can produce nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a recently introduced streptogramin antibiotic that  is active in vitro against most of the major gram-positive pathogens causing infection in neutropenic patients. recent studies of the in vitro susceptibility  of clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens to quinupristin/dalfopristin are  summarized. pre-clinical and clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive infections are reviewed. quinupristin/dalfopristin is active in vitro against the vast majority  of recent isolates of relevant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, but excluding enterococcus faecalis. pre-clinical and clinical data indicate the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin in infections caused by these organisms, including bacteraemia and catheter-related infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin is not associated with nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a potential alternative to glycopeptides in haematology or oncology patients with multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections, especially those who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, glycopeptides.

AB  == we report the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of 50 vana enterococcus clinical isolates from infected patients and 97 isolates from colonized patients  obtained during a nosocomial outbreak in a single hospital in sao paulo, brazil during 1998. the identification of strains to the species level by conventional biochemical and phenotypic tests and by multiplex pcr assay had 100% agreement. both e. faecalis and e. faecium were isolated from patients during this outbreak. the vana genotype was confirmed by pcr. antibiotic susceptibility testing showed  that e. faecium isolates are generally less susceptible to antibiotics than e. faecalis. by pcr, 24 of 26 vre strains tested carried the tn1546 element. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified five distinct patterns for e. faecalis (a, b, c, d, e) and three for e. faecium (m, n, and o). a single pfge pattern was identified in the majority of strains of each species and does not discriminate between case and carrier isolates.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci in king chulalongkorn memorial hospital: a 5-year study.
AB  == the emergence of hospital acquired infections with bacteria resistant to antimicrobials such as vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) has become a worldwide concern. the authors studied the prevalence and surveillance of 5 years study of vre in king chulalongkon memorial hospital and phenotype of these resistance strains. a total of enterococci 1854 isolates were collected from clinical specimens from 1995 to 1999. screening vancomycin resistance was identified by the agar plated method and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of vancomycin was determined for vancomycin-resistance strains by e-test. the results demonstated that 15 (0.81%) vre were isolated from 1,854 specimens. fourteen vre were identified as enterococcus faecium and one strain was enterococcus faecalis. all of these strains, carrying the vanb phenotype, were susceptible to teicoplanin. similar to other studies, most vre strains are e. faecium. to the authors' knowledge, this is the first vre study carried out in king chulalongkorn memorial hospital. the results showed a low prevalence of vre  and surveillance of 5 years study demonstated a gradual increase of vre. therefore, it is important to continue periodic surveys of vre to prevent the spread of vre in hospitals.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  == objective: to describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci species based  on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. materials and methods: the pharmacodynamic (pd) profile of daptomycin was determined against two mrsa, one vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. results: daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the mrsa and 1.5-2 log10 for the enterococcus species. auc/mic was the most predictive of the pd parameters. utilizing mics determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the pd parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. aucfree/micbroth required for static effects with mrsa and enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. conclusions: these data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against mrsa and enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.

TI  == molecular characterization of clinical and environmental isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from a teaching hospital in wales.
AB  == the present study describes the first molecular characterization of environmental and clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in wales. over a  3-month period (may-july 2000), 134 isolates of vre (89 enterococcus faecium and  45 enterococcus faecalis) were isolated from the patient environment of the university hospital of wales (uhw) in cardiff, wales, uk. in addition, over the same time-period, 24 clinical isolates of vre (20 isolates of e. faecium and four isolates of e. faecalis) were obtained from 14 patients. all study isolates were  subjected to pfge typing and their van genotypes were determined by using multiplex pcr. the vana pcr product (231 bp) was evident in 146 (92 %) of 158 vre isolates; the remaining 12 isolates (8 %) were positive for the vanb gene. all isolates of e. faecalis were found to be vana-positive. in total, 16 pfge banding profiles (pulsotypes) were observed for environmental isolates of e. faecium, whilst eight pulsotypes were found for isolates of e. faecalis. some of these pulsotypes were isolated from multiple sites, whereas others were more restricted in their distribution. eleven pulsotypes were evident for clinical isolates and eight of these (representing 11 isolates) were also encountered in environmental  isolates. eleven clinical isolates of e. faecium (55 %) shared an identical pulsotype that was not detected in environmental isolates. these results demonstrate a heterogeneous environmental population of vre and an association of certain strains with clinical isolates. predominance of a single pulsotype (not detected in the environment) amongst clinical isolates suggests non-environmental transmission between patients.

TI  == antibiotic activity against urinary tract infection (uti) isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre): results from the 2002 north american vancomycin resistant enterococci susceptibility study (navress).
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in urinary isolates in north america, and  the activity of various antibiotics against vre. materials and methods: twenty-eight medical centres in the united states and 10 centres in canada assessed the prevalence of vre in urinary isolates in 2002. each study site was asked to collect up to a maximum of 50 consecutive vre (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis only) urinary isolates. susceptibility was determined by nccls broth microdilution. the prevalence of vana and vanb resistance genotypes was determined by multiplex pcr. results: from the 28 us medical centres, a total of 697 vre (616 [88.4%] e. faecium and 81 [11.6%] e. faecalis) were received. approximately 75% of all vre (e. faecium and e. faecalis) isolates demonstrated a vana phenotype (resistance to both vancomycin and teicoplanin). pcr detection of  vana and vanb resistance determinants showed that the vana genotype was present in 584 of 697 (83.8%) vre isolates, whereas 113 (16.2%) isolates possessed the vanb gene. the most active agents were linezolid, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol, with 0.3%, 0.6% and 2.4% resistance, respectively. the majority  (77.8%) of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolates displayed the vana phenotype, and 538 of these 616 (87.3%) isolates were pcr-positive for vana; the vanb genotype was detected in 78 (12.7%) isolates. resistance was lowest with linezolid, chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin at 0.3%, 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. only three genetically indistinguishable vana-positive e. faecium were isolated from the 10 canadian medical centres. conclusion: vre urinary isolates are common in the united states, are primarily of the vana genotype and  are very susceptible to linezolid, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol. in canada, vre urinary isolates remain uncommon.

AB  == fifty samples of chicken, duck and geese faeces were obtained from 13 wet markets in kuala lumpur to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among local market poultry. biotyping of colonies grown on azide agar incubated at 45 degrees c yielded e. pseudoavium, e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. gallinarum from chicken faeces and e. malodoratus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae/dispar, and e. durans from goose and duck faeces. on agar containing 6 mg/ l of vancomycin, one strain of e. flavescens was identified, giving a vre detection rate of 2.0%. this isolate had a vancomycin m.i.c. of 8 mg/l as determined by the etest, and the van c-3 gene that was identified by pcr followed by sequence analysis. the prevalence of vre among poultry sold in local markets appears to be low, and may reflect the infrequent use of antimicrobials in our poultry farms. nevertheless, the possibility of human acquisition of microbes via the food chain cautions against the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry that may encourage the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant organisms like the vre among animal microbial flora.

AB  == three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanb2 tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. one s. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp is256-related element inserted in vans(b). the vanb2 tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free s. lutetiensis strain was transferable to enterococcus faecium bm4105-rf, enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, and  its recombination-deficient derivative, uv202. the transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). all transconjugants acquired a vanb-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. these observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might  be involved in the interspecies spread of vanb2 resistance determinants. two jh2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanb-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.

TI  == risk factors for new detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in acute-care  hospitals that employ strict infection control procedures.
AB  == accurate assessment of the risk factors for colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among high-risk patients is often confounded by nosocomial vre transmission. we undertook a 15-month prospective cohort study of adults admitted to high-risk units (hematology, renal, transplant, and intensive care) in three teaching hospitals that used identical strict infection control and isolation procedures for vre to minimize nosocomial  spread. rectal swab specimens for culture were regularly obtained, and the results were compared with patient demographic factors and antibiotic exposure data. compliance with screening was defined as "optimal" (100% compliance) or "acceptable" (minor protocol violations were allowed, but a negative rectal swab  specimen culture was required within 1 week of becoming colonized with vre). colonization with vre was detected in 1.56% (66 of 4,215) of admissions (0.45% at admission and 0.83% after admission; the acquisition time was uncertain for 0.28%), representing 1.91% of patients. no patients developed infection with vre. the subsequent rate of new acquisition of vre was 1.4/1,000 patient days. renal units had the highest rate (3.23/1,000 patient days; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.54 to 6.77/1,000 patient days). vanb enterococcus faecium was the most common species (71%), but other species included vanb enterococcus faecalis (21%), vana e. faecium (6%), and vana e. faecalis (2%). the majority of isolates  were nonclonal by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. multivariate analysis of risk factors in patients with an acceptable screening suggested that  being managed by a renal unit (hazard ratio [hr] compared to the results for patients managed in an intensive care unit, 4.6; 95% ci, 1.2 to 17.0 [p = 0.02])  and recent administration of either ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (hr, 3.6; 95% ci, 1.1 to 11.6 [p = 0.03]) or carbapenems (hr, 2.8; 95% ci, 1.0, 8.0 [p = 0.05]), but not vancomycin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, were associated with acquisition of vre. the relatively low rates of colonization with vre, the polyclonal nature of most isolates, and the possible association with the use of  broad-spectrum antibiotics are consistent with either the endogenous emergence of vre or the amplification of previously undetectable colonization with vre among high-risk patients managed under conditions in which the risk of nosocomial acquisition was minimized.

TI  == optimization of computer software settings improves accuracy of pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis macrorestriction fragment pattern analysis.
AB  == computer-assisted analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) libraries can facilitate comparisons of fragment patterns present on multiple gels. we evaluated the ability of the advanced analysis (version 4.01) and database (version 1.12) modules of the phoretix gel analysis software package (nonlinear usa, inc., durham, n.c.) to accurately match dna fragment patterns. two gels containing 38 lanes of smai-digested enterococcus faecalis og1rf dna were analyzed to assess the impact of (i) varying the lane position of the standards,  (ii) using gel plugs made at different times, and (iii) normalizing the fragment  patterns by using molecular weight (mw) algorithms versus retardation factor (r(f)) algorithms. two sets of pfge libraries (one containing smai restriction patterns from 62 enterococcus faecium isolates and the other containing smai restriction patterns of 89 staphylococcus aureus isolates) were analyzed to assess the impact of varying the matching tolerance algorithm (designated as the  vector box setting [vbs]) in the phoretix software. varying the lane position of  standards on a gel and using gel plugs made on different days resulted in different vbss, although it was not possible to judge whether those differences were statistically significant. normalization of e. faecalis og1rf fragment patterns by r(f) and mw methodology yielded no statistically significant differences in variability between the same fragment on different lanes. suboptimal vbss decreased the specificity with which related isolates were grouped together in dendrograms. the optimal vbs for analysis of pfge fragment patterns from e. faecalis isolates differed from that for s. aureus isolates and  sometimes was not that recommended by the manufacturer. thus, computer-assisted analysis of pfge patterns seemed to compensate for the intra- and intergel variation evaluated in the present study, and optimizing the software for the species to be tested was a critical preliminary step before further pfge library  analysis.

AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == [surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  == objective: to determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (hai) or community acquired infection (cai) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: according to the previous protocol, from july 1(st) 2000 to june  30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals.  among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected  to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of  the bacteria to the compounds tested. results: the detectable rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. among a total of 238 strains of s. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with cai and 37 were from hai patients, the rate of mrsa from hai patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of mrsa from cai patients (30.2%, 42/139) (p < 0.01). the total resistant rate of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) was 26.7% (8/30), including a r% of 3.3% (1/30) and an i% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. the  ratio of number of strains of e. faecalis to e. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). the rate of ampicillin resistant e. faecium (aref) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant e. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). neither strains of s. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative staphylococcus were found  resistant to vancomycin. no strains of enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of e. faecalis and e. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. all strains of enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. conclusion: the resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci including mrsa, prsp, and aref are similar to the results of  the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. no strain of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, including vrsa and visa or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, vre is found in this study.

TI  == molecular alterations of vana element in vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated during a survey of colonized patients in an italian intensive care unit.
AB  == to screen for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) colonization in hospitalized patients and to study molecular evolution and alterations of tn1546-like elements in vre among potentially at-risk patients, a 3-year surveillance protocol in an intensive care unit was performed. a total of 397 patients were screened in the period june, 1997-june, 2000, and vre were isolated from rectal swabs taken at admission, weekly, and when clinically indicated. the susceptibility of the enterococci was determined by the disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. the  presence of vancomycin-resistance genes (vana, vanb, and vanc) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr); genetic clonality of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge); tn1546 types were obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of tn1546 pcr fragments. thirty-four strains, 31 identified as enterococcus faecium and 3 strains as e. faecalis, were isolated from 12 of the 397 patients (3.0%); all strains were vana as assessed by pcr and were resistant to the other antibiotics tested and showed  high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. enterococci isolated during the study period showed that different genetic backgrounds of strains, determined by pfge combined with rflp of tn1546, are present in all the strains isolated in the study. pfge type b was predominant in 1998 and 1999, and insertion sequence movements were found to have a role in the evolution of vana resistance elements  found in all strains. this study demonstrates that single patients may be colonized by closely related vre with several pfge types containing a wide variety of vana elements. moreover, isolates with identical pfge types may contain different vana elements reflecting rearrangements mediated by insertion sequences in vre strains during their stay in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == screening for enterocins and detection of hemolysin and vancomycin resistance in  enterococci of different origins.
AB  == the inhibitory activity of 122 out of 426 enterococcus strains of geographically  widespread origin and from different sources (food and feed, animal isolates, clinical and nonclinical human isolates) was tested against a wide range of indicator bacteria. seventy-two strains, mainly belonging to the species enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were bacteriocinogenic. a remarkable variation of inhibitory spectra occurred among the strains tested, including inhibition of, for instance, only closely related enterococci, other lactic acid bacteria (lab), food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. no correlation could be found between the origin of the strains and the type of inhibitory spectrum, although a clustering of human isolates from both fecal and clinical origin was observed in the group of strains inhibiting lactic acid bacteria, listeria, and either staphylococcus or clostridium. no relationship could be established between the presence of enterocin structural genes and the origin of  the strain either, and hence no correlation seemed to exist between the presence  of known enterocin genes and the activity spectra of these enterococci. the structural gene of enterocin a was widely distributed among e. faecium strains, whereas that of enterocin b only occurred in the presence of enterocin a. the vancomycin resistance phenotype as well as the presence of vancomycin resistance  genes was also investigated. the vana gene only occurred among e. faecium strains. the incidence of beta-hemolysis was not restricted to e. faecalis strains, but among the e. faecium strains the structural genes of cytolysin were  not detected. beta-hemolysis occurred in strains both from food and nonfood origin. it has been concluded that bacteriocin-producing e. faecium strains lacking hemolytic activity and not carrying cytolysin nor vancomycin resistance genes may be useful as starter cultures, cocultures, or probiotics.

TI  == correlation between enterococcal biofilm formation in vitro and medical-device-related infection potential in vivo.
AB  == hospital-acquired infections caused by enterococci have increased dramatically since the 1970s. many nosocomial enterococcal bloodstream infections are associated with medical devices such as central venous catheters. the ability to  form biofilm on medical devices is a potential virulence trait that may allow enterococci to cause infections in the expanding population of patients managed with such devices. in this study, the hypothesis that increased ability to form biofilm in vitro is associated with medical-device-related infection in vivo was  tested. a microplate assay was employed to assess biofilm-forming characteristics of enterococci in 0.9 % (w/v) sodium chloride, an oligotrophic environment, and bhi, a nutrient-rich environment. results were compared in isolates from different sources of infection. one hundred and nine enterococcal bloodstream isolates were assayed. biofilm formation on microplates was demonstrated by all enterococcus faecalis isolates and 16/38 (42 %) enterococcus faecium isolates. e. faecalis isolates produced significantly more biofilm than e. faecium isolates in both media (p < 0.0001, mann-whitney u test). e. faecalis isolates from intravascular-catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis) produced significantly more biofilm than non-crbsi isolates (p < 0.0001), or isolates of uncertain clinical significance (p < 0.0001). biofilm formed by e. faecium isolates was not significantly affected by culture medium and did not differ between isolates from the different clinical categories. in conclusion, there was significantly more biofilm formed by e. faecalis isolates causing crbsi compared  with isolates from other types of infection or from isolates of uncertain clinical significance. the ability of e. faecalis isolates to form biofilm in vitro appears to be a marker of a virulence trait that enhances the ability of isolates to cause crbsi.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

TI  == ramoplanin: a novel antimicrobial agent with the potential to prevent vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection in high-risk patients.
AB  == the prevention of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) colonization and infection continues to be a high priority for clinicians. an oral antimicrobial agent that reduces or eliminates vre gastrointestinal colonization could be useful for preventing vre infection in selected patients. ramoplanin, a glycolipodepsipeptide, is the first in a new class of antimicrobials. it has excellent in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. it is orally administered, and not absorbed systemically.  in clinical trials, vre gastrointestinal colonization was reduced to undetectable levels in 80-90% of patients during receipt of ramoplanin. a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre study is currently being conducted to determine whether ramoplanin will prevent vre bloodstream infection in oncology patients who are neutropenic due to treatment for a haematological malignancy or a bone marrow/stem cell transplant.

AB  == the occurrence and antibiotic resistance of enterococci, especially enterococcus  faecalis and enterococcus faecium, in milk, beef, and chicken in gaborone, botswana, were studied. enterococci were isolated from these sources with the use of bile esculin agar and identified with api 20 strep kits. antibiotic resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method. the antibiotics tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and cephalothin. among the 1,467 enterococci isolated from the samples, e. faecalis (46.1%) and e. faecium (29.0%) were found to be the predominant species. other enterococcal species made up 25% of the isolates. more than 96 and 97% of the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, respectively, were found to be resistant to ampicillin. almost 34, 27.3, and 22.4% of the e. faecalis isolates from milk, beef, and chicken, respectively, were also resistant to cephalothin. the percentages of e. faecium isolates that were found to be resistant to cephalothin were 32.8, 16.9, and 17.3% for milk, beef, and chicken, respectively. resistance to vancomycin was widespread. it was found that 18.8, 7.8. and 13.1% of the e. faecalis isolates from milk, beef, and chicken samples, respectively, were resistant to vancomycin. in contrast, 32.8, 24.7, and 30.7% of the e. faecium isolates from milk, beef, and chicken samples, respectively, were resistant to vancomycin. isolates that were resistant to multiple drugs were found in relatively large numbers.

TI  == development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  == selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. in this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage p1 temperature-sensitive c1 repressor in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. using the lacz gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying c1 operator sites. the promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). we demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the  mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. however, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the c1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

AB  == aims: scarce knowledge about the distribution of enterococci species in wastewaters limits any statement on their reliability as faecal indicators or the implications of antibiotic resistance transmission by these organisms through the water cycle. enterococci have been involved in nosocomial infections and the spreading of antibiotic resistance through the food chain. the species distribution of enterococci and the presence of resistant strains to vancomycin and erythromycin were analysed in more than 400 raw and treated urban wastewaters, surface waters receiving these treated wastewaters and hospital wastewaters from three european countries. methods and results: a total of 9296 strains were isolated and biochemically phenotyped. the species identification was based on the comparison of biochemical profiles with those of more than 20000 enterococci isolates from an international study. the prevalence of enterococcal  isolates resistant to erythromycin (ere) and vancomycin (vre) was also analysed.  ere strains were present in a high proportion in all the studied samples. vre strains were also isolated in all studied countries despite the time elapsed since the use of antimicrobial glycopeptides in animal production was banned in the european union. conclusions: enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium were the  most abundant species in all the studied wastewaters. all the studied wastewaters demonstrated high diversity and similar population structure and composition. ere and vre isolates were detected in most of the wastewaters. significance and impact of the study: urban and hospital wastewaters are useful targets for the evaluation of the prevalence of ere and vre isolates in the environment. it appears that these bacteria could pass through wastewater treatment plants and be transferred to surface waters.

TI  == incidence of virulence determinants in clinical enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates collected in sardinia (italy).
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in the environment; within the human body, they are normal commensals of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. in recent years, enterococci have become one of the most frequent causes of acquired nosocomial infections worldwide. the molecular mechanism of virulence of these bacteria is still not completely understood. the aims of this work were to  characterize phenotypically 47 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium collected in sardinia (italy) by their abilities to adhere to different epithelial cell lines (vero and caco-2 cells) and to associate their phenotypes with the presence of known virulence genes detected within their genomes by pcr.  the following genes were amplified: as (aggregation substance), esp (surface protein gene), ace (accessory colonization factor), efaa (e. faecalis endocarditis antigen) and gele (gelatinase). the virulence genes were detected in e. faecalis isolates only, with the exception of esp, which was found in both species. the phenotypic and genotypic results were also compared with the susceptibility of isolates to various antibiotics.

TI  == geographic variations and trends in antimicrobial resistance among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == in the 1990s, the enterococcus emerged as an important pathogen because of increasing prevalence and acquired resistances to glycopeptides and other agents. the seriousness of this problem can vary markedly worldwide and within nations; the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program documents these differences. over 8,000 enterococci were processed in the program (1997-2000) and the enterococcus  faecalis (ef; 4,034 strains) and enterococcus faecium (efm; 1,123 strains) isolates are tabulated. all strains were processed by three regional monitors using reference dilution methods. identification to species was performed by participants and confirmed by the central laboratories. ef occurrence was greater than efm by ratios of 3:1 to 5:1 in the asia-pacific (apac), european (eu), and north american (na) regions; the ratio was 17:1 in latin america (la). ef and efm represented approximately 80-90% of all isolated enterococci. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) rates varied from nil for ef in apac and la to 43 to 54% in efm in na. a slight increase in gre was noted in na (efm only). van a phenotypes predominated all regions. the most recent (2000) rank order of % gre by region was: for na (13%) > la (4%) > eu (3%) > apac (1%). in na potential therapeutic agents were (% s): ampicillin (81%), chloramphenicol (87%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (20%), ciprofloxacin (39%), gatifloxacin (51%), nitrofurantoin (83%) and linezolid (>99%). resistances in enterococci continue to be documented worldwide, but rates within endemic areas like na appears to be stabilizing. van a resistance patterns predominate and therapeutic options continue to present dilemmas, although some of the older agents remain usable as  primary therapy or as alternatives to the newer agents such as the oxazolidinones.

AB  == objective: to describe the antimicrobial activity of several antimicrobial agents against 97 clinical significant isolates of enterococcus spp. material and methods: during a 2-year prospective study at instituto nacional de pediatria (national institute of pediatrics) in mexico city. ninety seven strains of enterococcus spp. (60 e faecalis and 37 e. faecium) were tested against 11 antibiotics. susceptibility tests were performed with agar, according to the standards of the snational committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). isolates were screened for high-level resistance (hlr) to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides and other antibiotics, as well as for vancomycin-phenotypes. differences between proportions were evaluated with chi 2  of fisher exact fest. results: overall resistance rates to the antibiotics tested were: 17/97 (17.5%) to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and imipenem. there was neither hlr nor beta-lactamase production; 74/97 (48.4%) were resistant to erythromycin; 60% to ciprofloxacin; 31/97 (32%) to gentamicin, and 55/97 (56.7%) to streptomycin. seven strains were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), all of them identified as e. faecium; 5/7 with van a and 2/7 with van b phenotypes. all the isolates were susceptible to linezolid. the difference in susceptibility among species was significant. conclusions: mutidrug-resistant enterococci is a real problem and continuous surveillance is necessary. the microbiology laboratory is the first line of defense against the spread of multiantibiotic-resistan enterococci in the hospital environment. all the strains recovered should be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and glycopeptides. the english version of this paper is  available too at: http://www.insp.mx/salud/index.html.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by enterococci.
AB  == the bacterial surfaces of enterococci are not uniform. this fact is confirmed by  several studies and by our results when great differences between individual strains with regard to their cell surface hydrophobicity, binding of eight ecm (extracellular matrix) molecules immobilized on latex beads and four selected ecm molecules in microtiter plates were observed. the strains expressing high binding of ecm molecules (e.g., hj 18, hj 23, hj 24, hj 26, hj 28, hj 36, etc.) were found among enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium by paa (particle agglutination assay). on the other hand, weak ecm binders (e.g., hj 21, hj 32, hj 34, hj 38, hj 39, hj 42, hj 43) were also found. a direct correlation was found between porcine mucin and fetuin binding ability of eight selected strains tested in microtiter plates and by paa. moreover, the influence of tunicamycin treatment was different because significant (p < 0.001) blocking effect of tunicamycin was observed with  two selected strains (hj 26 and hj 36), whereas two strains (hj 18 and hj 22) were not significantly affected in their fetuin binding. the treatment of six enterococcal strains with proteolytic enzymes, pronase p, and trypsin, and with sodium metaperiodate also significantly (p < 0.001) decreased their fetuin binding. this suggests that both protein and carbohydrate moieties are involved in the binding of immobilized fetuin. however, the influence of these chemicals on the fetuin binding by individual strains was different.

AB  == integrated fish farming uses the manure from animal husbandry as fertilisers in the fish ponds. a total of 410 enterococcal isolates, from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand, were collected to assess whether the input of manure from chickens receiving feed containing growth promoters and antimicrobial treatments influenced the species composition and the bacterial antimicrobial resistance in the fish pond environment. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were the predominate species isolated from the integrated farms, whereas e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii isolates were most prevalent in traditional farms. enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium demonstrated the highest prevalence of resistance, whereas e. mundtii isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. all the enterococci species isolated from the integrated farms, generally demonstrated higher resistance phenotypes to the tested antimicrobials compared with the same species from traditional farms. the erm(b) and tet(m) genes, associated with resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively, were found in 87% of the erythromycin-resistant and 95% of the oxytetracycline-resistant enterococci isolates respectively. these results suggest that the species composition and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci  in tropical aquatic environments are influenced by faecal and antimicrobial pollution.

TI  == presence of a vana-carrying pheromone response plasmid (pbrg1) in a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == sex pheromone plasmids, frequently found in enterococcus faecalis, have rarely been detected in enterococcus faecium. pbrg1 is an approximately 50-kb vana-carrying conjugative plasmid of an e. faecium clinical isolate (ls10) that is transferable to e. faecalis laboratory strains. in cell infection experiments, e. faecium ls10 exhibited remarkably high invasion efficiency and produced cytopathogenic effects in caco-2 cell monolayers. growth in the presence of sex pheromones produced by e. faecalis jh2-2 was found to cause self-aggregation of both e. faecium ls10 and e. faecalis jh-rfv(pbrg1) (a transconjugant obtained by  transfer of pbrg1 to e. faecalis jh2-2) and to increase the cell adhesion and invasion efficiencies of both e. faecium ls10 and e. faecalis jh-rfv(pbrg1). sex  pheromone ccf10 caused clumping of e. faecalis og1rf(pbrg1) (a transconjugant obtained by transfer of pbrg1 to e. faecalis og1rf) at a concentration approximately 100-fold higher than the one required for the control strain e. faecalis og1rf(pcf10). pcr products of the expected sizes were obtained with primers internal to aggregation substance genes of e. faecalis pheromone response plasmids pad1, ppd1, and pcf10 and primers internal to ash701 of e. faecium pheromone plasmid phkk701. these findings suggest that pbrg1 of e. faecium ls10 is a sex pheromone response plasmid.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in recent fecal enterococci from healthy volunteers and  food handlers in spain: genes and phenotypes.
AB  == susceptibility patterns to 15 different antibiotics and the presence of resistance genes were evaluated in recent fecal enterococcus isolates recovered from 42 healthy volunteers (hv) and 43 food-handlers (fh). a total of 142 enterococcus faecalis, 74 enterococcus faecium, and 23 enterococcus spp. with different antibiotic susceptibility patterns were studied. a higher percentage of resistance for moxifloxacin, erythromycin, glycopeptides and high-level resistance (hlr) to gentamicin were observed in the fh group. ampicillin- or linezolid-resistant isolates were not recovered in any of the groups. the tet(m)  gene was found in 96% and in 85% of tetracycline-resistant isolates from hv and fh, respectively. hlr-kanamycin was mediated by aph(3')-iiia, or aac(6')-aph(2"), or both genes in all isolates from hv group and in 86% from fh group. the aac(6')-aph(2") gene was found in all hlr-gentamicin isolates. ninety-one percent of hv and 71% of fh erythromycin-resistant isolates harbored the erm(b) gene (erythromycin mic range of 8-128 microg/ml), whereas erm(a), erm(c), or mef(a) genes were not detected. coexistence of erm(b), aph(3')-iiia, and tet(m) genes was observed in 17% of the isolates of both groups. the hlr-gentamicin isolates presented unrelated pfge patterns while 2 out of 3 vana e. faecium isolates showed an indistinguishable smai-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) pattern. this study shows that despite 4 years of official banning of antibiotic growth promoters in animals, enterococci isolated from fh are more resistant than those  from hv. this suggests the permanence of resistant clones or transferable resistance elements in farms and a possible exchange between food products and humans, or eventually the long-term permanence of certain clones in the fh intestinal tract.

TI  == isolation and characterization of streptomyces sp kh-614 producing anti-vre (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) antibiotics.
AB  == the actinomycete strain kh-614 was antagonistic to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, morphological and physiological characteristics examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh-614 was confirmed as belonging to the genus streptomyces. based on the 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, streptomyces sp. kh-614 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces lydicus. the production of antibiotic from this strain was most favorable when cultured in glucose, polypeptone, yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic was identified as a cyclo(l-leucyl-l-prolyl) by comparing it with the reported spectral data including ms and nmr. cyclo(leu-pro) was found to be active against twelve vre strains, including e. faecium (vana, vanb), and e. faecalis (vana, vanb), that had been isolated over a period three years (1998-2000). cyclo(leu-pro) was especially effective against vre strains such as e. faecalis (k-99-34), e. faecalis (k-00-184), e. faecalis (k-00-221), and the mic values were 12.5 microg/ml. moreover, cyclo(leu-pro) was effective against three leukemic cell lines at concentrations below 100 microg/ml. at 100 mg/ml cyclo(leu-pro), k562, hl60, and u937 leukemic cell lines showed growth inhibition of 95, 91, and 93%, respectively. in a normal cell line, mdbk, cyclo(leu-pro) exerted 24% growth inhibition at a concentration of 100 microg/ml, and showed no inhibitory activity at concentrations below 10 microg/ml. these results indicate that cyclo(leu-pro)  is a potential anti-leukemic and anti-vre agent.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin as-48 from an enterococcus faecium strain and analysis of the gene cluster involved in its production.
AB  == the cyclic bacteriocin as-48 has previously been shown to be produced by enterococcus faecalis strains. a bacteriocin has been purified from an e. faecium strain (e. faecium 7c5), and it has been found to possess molecular mass, cyclization and amino acid sequence typical of bacteriocin as-48. in addition to  the structural gene as-48a, the sequence analysis of the as-48 gene cluster present in e. faecium 7c5 has revealed the presence of several putative coding regions presumably involved in bacteriocin production and immunity. the results of dna hybridization assays have indicated that the as-48 gene cluster and the gene pd78 are present on the same plasmid, possibly the ppd1 plasmid, in e. faecium 7c5.

TI  == anomalies in species identification of enterococci from veterinary sources using  a commercial biochemical identification system.
AB  == aims: a commercial biochemical panel id kit was used to identify presumptive enterococci isolates of veterinary or agricultural origin obtained during different steps of culture. methods and results: fifty isolates identified as enterococci using a genus pcr assay were tested for genus and species identification using the bbl crystal identification gram-positive id kit (becton  dickinson, sparks, md, usa). following sub-culture of the isolates three times, 59% agreement with the original panel id was obtained. after four and six sub-cultures, percentage agreement increased to 61 and 64%, respectively. nineteen of the 50 cultures were identified as both enterococcus faecalis and e.  faecium. conclusions: as a result of the variability between speciation of isolates following re-culture, additional methods for speciation are warranted. significance and impact of the study: this study suggests that the identification of the genus and species of non-human enterococcal isolates can vary greatly during successive passages when using this kit.

TI  == clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by acm, a new member of the mscramm family.
AB  == a collagen-binding adhesin of enterococcus faecium, acm, was identified. acm shows 62% similarity to the staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin cna over the entire protein and is more similar to cna (60% and 75% similarity with cna a and  b domains respectively) than to the enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, ace, which shares homology with acm only in the a domain. despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 e. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and  seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type i (ci). although acm from three ci-binding vancomycin-resistant e. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-ci-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or is elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of e. faecium strains to ci. recombinant acm a domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with e. faecium binding to immobilized ci. consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with acm-specific iggs purified from anti-recombinant acm a polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of e. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-ci-binding natural acm mutant  strains conferred a ci-binding phenotype, further confirming that native acm is sufficient for the binding of e. faecium to ci. these results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of e. faecium, and suggest that acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of e. faecium to bind collagen.

AB  == quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrate in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including many isolates resistant to earlier antimicrobials. quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against enterococcus faecalis but has been effective for treatment of infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium associated with bacteremia. in comparative trials, linezolid proved to be equivalent to comparator agents, resulting in its approval for several clinical indications. the almost-complete bioavailability of linezolid permits oral administration. each agent can cause adverse effects that may limit use in individual patients. resistance to these drugs has been encountered infrequently among vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is rare among staphylococci in the united states, and resistance to linezolid is very rare. whether there is any benefit to use of these agents in combination regimens, and whether there are circumstances  in which they might be alternatives to cell-wall active antibiotics for treatment of bone or endovascular infections, are questions that deserve further study.

AB  == we determined the species distribution and prevalence of ampicillin resistance, high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) and vancomycin resistance among clinical  enterococcal isolates from five nordic laboratories (bergen, tromso, uppsala, aarhus and reykjavik). isolates represented three different groups: (i) all blood culture isolates from 1999; (ii) consecutive in-patient isolates (maximum 40); and (iii) consecutive outpatient isolates (maximum 40) collected during march to  may 2000. antimicrobial use data were collected at the national and hospital level. a high proportion (31.4%) of enterococcus faecium was detected among blood culture isolates, in contrast to only 4.2% among isolates from outpatients. ampicillin resistance was not found in enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 48.8% in e. faecium isolates. hlgr rates varied considerably between laboratories (1.1-27.6%). acquired vancomycin resistance was not detected. there were no significant differences in the prevalences of hlgr between in-patient and outpatient isolates at individual hospitals. a cluster of clonally related ampicillin-resistant and hlgr e. faecium isolates was demonstrated in one of the  hospitals. the lowest level of hospital antimicrobial use, the lowest proportion  of e. faecium and the lowest prevalence of resistance were observed in reykjavik. the study showed a relatively low level of resistance in enterococci, as compared with most european countries and the usa. however, there were large differences between hospitals with regard to the relative proportion of e. faecium isolates,  their susceptibility to ampicillin and gentamicin, as well as the prevalence of hlgr in e. faecalis isolates. this indicates a potential for further improvement  of antibiotic policies, and possibly hospital infection control, to maintain the  low resistance levels observed in these countries.

TI  == flow cytometric determination of enterococcus spp. susceptibility to four antimicrobial agents.
AB  == two enterococcus strains (e. faecalis and e. faecium) isolated from 2 patients in an intensive care unit (blood and drain, respectively) were analyzed for susceptibility to 4 antibiotics (penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin) by agar dilution standard method (mics), time-kill and flow cytometry. we compared the data from classical methods of antibiotic susceptibility detection, that are compulsory 24 hrs long and flow cytometry results at 5 and 24 hrs cultivation. the results from both classical and flow cytometric analyses were highly cogent and revealed the fact that flow cytometry  is very useful in early diagnosis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

TI  == intestinal mucosal oxidative damage and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.
AB  == background: bacterial translocation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis mainly due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth. alterations in the functional integrity of the intestinal barrier caused by an increased production of free radical metabolites as a consequence of portal hypertension could also facilitate bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. objective: the aim of the study was to determine intestinal mucosal lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration and their relationship with portal hypertension and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. design: eighteen male sprague-dawley rats with cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride, administered  by gavage, and eight control rats were included in the study. methods: samples of jejunum, ileum and caecum were obtained by laparotomy for the determination of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase as indexes of lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. samples of ascitic and pleural fluids, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal stools were obtained for the culture of microoganisms. results: the concentration of malondialdehyde was significantly higher in ileal and caecal, but not in jejunal mucosa, in cirrhotic rats, mainly  in those with ascites (p< 0.01), as compared to control rats (p< 0.01), and in cirrhotic rats with bacterial translocation compared to those without bacterial translocation (p< 0.01). no differences between groups were observed in the concentrations of myeloperoxidase in jejunum, ileum or caecum. a direct correlation between ileal malondialdehyde and portal pressure was observed (p< 0.01). conclusions: cirrhotic rats, particularly those with ascites and bacterial translocation, show increased malondialdehyde levels in ileal and caecal mucosa.  these results suggest that mucosal oxidative damage in ileum and caecum could favour bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.

TI  == species prevalence and antibacterial resistance of enterococci isolated in kuwait hospitals.
AB  == this study investigated the species prevalence and antibacterial resistance among enterococci isolated in kuwait hospitals. they consisted of 415 isolates of enterococcus faecalis (85.3 %), enterococcus faecium (7.7 %), enterococcus casseliflavus (4.0 %), enterococcus avium (1.2 %), enterococcus durans (1.0 %), enterococcus gallinarium (0.5 %) and enterococcus bovis (0.2 %) isolated from urine (36.6 %), blood (10.4 %), wound swabs (11.0 %), stool samples (12.0 %), high vaginal swabs (9.0 %), endocervical swabs (3.0 %) and miscellaneous sources  (18.0 %). all of them were susceptible to linezolid. fifty-two (12.5 %) isolates  were ampicillin resistant but none of them produced beta-lactamase. they were resistant to erythromycin (63.3 %), tetracycline (60.5 %), ciprofloxacin (40.0 %), chloramphenicol (28.0 %), vancomycin (2.6 %), and teicoplanin (2.6 %). fourteen, 19 and 20 % of them expressed high-level resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin, respectively. all of the vancomycin-resistant strains carried the vana phenotype and genotype. there was no evidence of clonal spread of the vancomycin-resistant isolates.

TI  == mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was  less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes,  1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == phenotypes and genotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated during long-term follow-up in a patient with recurrent bacteremia and colonization.
AB  == twenty-seven isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were obtained at monthly intervals from a bed-ridden man with hypoxic encephalopathy. during the 28-month period of the patient's hospitalization, 3 episodes of bacteremia and one episode of catheter-related infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci occurred. rectal swabs showed colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci for more than 2 years. three months after termination of antimicrobial therapy, the rectal colonization for vancomycin-resistant enterococci was eradicated. four species (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus) were identified among the 27 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates. three non-clonal related patterns were found among 17 strains of e. faecium by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all of the 3 e. faecalis isolates were of the vanb phenotype, but of the vana genotype. linezolid had the most potent in vitro  activity against these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations >2 microg/ml. eighty-five percent of these vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and 66% were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. although a high genetic correlation of e. faecium was identified in the patient with prolonged hospitalization, the isolation of 3 genetically unrelated colonized isolates suggested a lack of correlation between infection and colonization. precautions against resistant organisms, adapted antibiotic policies, and elimination of patient carriage are useful for controlling the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == isolation and biochemical characterisation of enterocins produced by enterococci  from different sources.
AB  == aims: comparison of enterocins produced by six enterococcus faecium strains and one ent. faecalis strain isolated from different origin with regard to their microbiological and biochemical characteristics in view of their technological potential and practical use. methods and results: the seven enterococci were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin and did not  show haemolytic activity. the absence of the glycopeptide-resistant genotypes and the genes involved in the production of the lantibiotic cytolysin was confirmed by pcr. the enterocins were active towards listeria innocua and other lactic acid bacteria. their temperature stability was dependent on the ph and their activity  was higher at acidic ph. a bactericidal and bacteriolytic effect was shown. pcr analyses revealed that the gene of enterocin a was present in the genome of ent.  faecium ccm 4231, ent. faecium 306 i.2.20 and ent. faecalis y; both enterocin a and b genes were present in the genome of ent. faecium lmg 11423t, ent. faecium rzs c5 and ent. faecium rzs c13. enterocin p was detected in the genome of ent. faecium rzs c5 and ent. faecium rzs c13. no signal was found for ent. faecium sf  68. enterocins from ent. faecium rzs c5, ent. faecium rzs c13 and ent. faecium sf 68 were purified to homogeneity. conclusions: ent. faecium rzs c5 and ent. faecium rzs c13 produced an enterocin with a molecular mass of 5460 and 5477 da,  respectively, which was in the range of that of enterocin b. the amino acid sequence analysis of the enterocin from ent. faecium rzs c13 revealed 24 n-terminal residues, which were identical to those of enterocin b. the enterocin  from ent. faecium sf 68 had a molecular mass of 4488 da, which did not correspond to any enterocin known so far. significance and impact of the study: the number of characterized enterocins is increasing. as this type of work is tedious and time-consuming, it may be interesting to include pcr as a first step to know if the enterococcus strain in study produces either a known or a new enterocin. also, it is important to check the absence of cytolysin and resistance to vancomycin for a further application of the enterococcus strain in food or health applications.

TI  == multicentre assessment of linezolid antimicrobial activity and spectrum in europe: report from the zyvox antimicrobial potency study (zaps-europe).
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro spectrum and activity of linezolid, a recent  oxazolidinone, according to well-controlled surveillance data from 42 medical centers in 13 countries throughout europe. methods: participants tested the susceptibility of 125 clinical strains of enterococcal and staphylococcal species against 13 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays or the standardized disk diffusion method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). streptococcal species (n = 25 at each center) were tested against six drugs using e test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality assurance testing was conducted using nccls-recommended strains and verification of resistance to linezolid and other selected agents was performed by retesting strains at the regional (europe) and international (usa) monitor sites. results: a total of 5598 strains from throughout europe (91% compliance) were tested. vancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of streptococcus pneumoniae; 4.9% at the high-level (> or =2 mg/l). the mic90 for linezolid was 1  mg/l for streptococci and 2 mg/l for enterococci and staphylococci. using the us  fda- and eucast-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no  confirmed reports of linezolid resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), > or =8 mg/l]. the distribution of linezolid mic values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1 mg/l for streptococci (>90% of isolates), and between 1 and 2 mg/l for staphylococci (>90%) and enterococci (>95%). there were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin-, oxacillin-, or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains when compared to susceptible organism populations. conclusions: compared to the north american component of this study, there was substantially less vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates (europe 3.0% vs. north america 63.4%). while the occurrence of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in europe and north america was similar (25.1% vs. 29.7%), the recovery of high-level penicillin-resistant strains was nearly three-fold higher in north america (4.9% vs. 13.2%). only linezolid was universally active against all the tested gram-positive isolates at </=4 mg/l.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == effect of raw-milk cheese consumption on the enterococcal flora of human feces.
AB  == enterococci are one of the major facultative anaerobic bacterial groups that reside in the human gastrointestinal tract. in the present study, the composition of the enterococcal fecal flora in three healthy humans was analyzed before, during, and after the daily consumption of approximately 125 g of a raw-milk cheddar-type cheese containing 3.2 x 10(4) enterococci/g of cheese. enterococcal  counts ranged between 1.4 x 10(2) and 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/g of feces and differed from subject to subject and from week to week. the cheese contained mainly enterococcus casseliflavus and a small population of enterococcus faecalis. clonal relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. before  and after consumption of the cheese, samples from humans contained mainly enterococcus faecium, with some of the clones being resident. during consumption  of the cheese, one particular transient clone of e. faecalis, clone fs2, which was present in small numbers in the cheese, largely dominated the feces. two clones of e. casseliflavus from the cheese were also found in the feces of one of the subjects during cheese consumption. these results suggest that a clone need not be present in a food in high numbers to establish itself in the intestine.

TI  == activity and diffusion of tigecycline (gar-936) in experimental enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the activity of tigecycline (gar-936), a novel glycylcycline, was investigated in vitro and in experimental endocarditis due to the susceptible enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 strain, its vana type transconjugant bm4316, and a clinical vana type strain, e. faecium hb217 resistant to tetracycline. mics of gar-936 were 0.06 micro g/ml for the three strains. in vitro pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of gar-936 that was not enhanced by increasing concentrations to more than 1 micro g/ml and a postantibiotic effect ranging from 1 to 4.5 h for concentrations of 1- to 20-fold the mic. intravenous  injection of [(14)c]gar-936 to five rabbits with enterococcal endocarditis sacrificed 30 min, 4 h, or 12 h after the end of the infusion evidenced a lower clearance of gar-936 from aortic vegetations than from serum and a homogeneous diffusion of gar-936 into the vegetations. in rabbits with endocarditis, gar-936  (14 mg/kg of body weight twice a day [b.i.d.]) given intravenously for 5 days was bacteriostatic against both strains of e. faecalis. against e. faecium hb217, bacterial counts in vegetations significantly decreased during therapy (p < 0.01), and the effect was similar with gar-936 at 14 mg/kg b.i.d., 14 mg/kg once  a day (o.d.), and 7 mg/kg o.d., which provided concentrations in serum constantly above the mic. mean serum elimination half-life ranged from 3.3 to 3.6 h. no gar-936-resistant mutants were selected in vivo with any regimen. we concluded that the combination of prolonged half-life, significant postantibiotic effect, and good and homogeneous diffusion into the vegetations may account for the in vivo activity of gar-936 against enterococci susceptible or resistant to glycopeptides and tetracyclines, even when using a o.d. regimen in rabbits.

AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

AB  == the ability to colonize patients successfully may be essential for the emergence  and spread of resistant nosocomial strains. we determined the presence of esp, a  surface protein involved in colonization ability in enterococcus faecalis, in 96  enterococcus faecium isolates from hospitalized patients (77 pfge clones), 33 faecal isolates from healthy volunteers (32 clones) and 20 environmental isolates (20 clones). esp was found significantly more often in e. faecium isolated from hospitalized patients than in isolates from the community setting (26% versus 6%, p < 0.01) and was significantly more common among ampicillin-resistant than among ampicillin-susceptible strains (37% versus 4%, p < 0.001), regardless of the isolation site. the frequency of the esp gene in the hospital clearly correlates  with antibiotic-resistant e. faecium clones. this observation indicates that antibiotic-resistant variants may frequently arise under antibiotic selective pressure among esp-positive clones reaching ecological abundance in the nosocomial habitat.

TI  == prevalence of streptogramin resistance genes among enterococcus isolates recovered from retail meats in the greater washington dc area.
AB  == the prevalence of streptogramin resistance genes in enterococci recovered from retail poultry in the greater washington dc area was examined. forty-three chicken and 32 turkey retail samples were analysed. thirty-one non-enterococcus faecalis enterococcal strains were isolated that displayed mics of quinupristin-dalfopristin and virginiamycin of > or = 4 mg/l. these included enterococcus faecium (turkey n = 4, chicken n = 23), enterococcus gallinarum (turkey n = 2, chicken n = 1) and enterococcus hirae (chicken n = 1). the presence of streptogramin resistance genes was examined by pcr in all non-e. faecalis isolates. the vat(e) gene was detected in 10/23 chicken e. faecium and from 2/4 turkey e. faecium. no other streptogramin resistance genes were detected by pcr. in addition, erm(b) was detected in all the e. faecium and e. gallinarum  found in turkeys and in 7/23 e. faecium found in chickens. the vat(e) gene was transferable by conjugation from only two of the 12 e. faecium isolates (one from chicken and one from turkey). this study suggests that there is a high prevalence of low-level streptogramin resistance among enterococci found in retail poultry and that other, yet to be identified, mechanisms operate in these isolates that confer streptogramin resistance in enterococci.

TI  == characterization of tn1546 in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated  from canine urinary tract infections: evidence of gene exchange between human and animal enterococci.
AB  == thirty-five enterococcal isolates were recovered from dogs diagnosed with urinary tract infections at the michigan state university veterinary teaching hospital over a 2-year period (1996 to 1998). isolated species included enterococcus faecium (n = 13), enterococcus faecalis (n = 7), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 11), and enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4). antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed several different resistance phenotypes, with the majority of the enterococcal isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more antibiotics. one e.  faecium isolate, cvm1869, displayed high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic > 32 micro g/ml) and gentamicin (mic > 2,048 micro g/ml). molecular analysis of this isolate revealed the presence of tn1546 (vana), responsible for high-level vancomycin resistance, and tn5281 carrying aac6'-aph2", conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that cvm1869 was a canine e. faecium clone that had acquired tn1546, perhaps from a human vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. transposons tn5281 and tn1546 were located on two different conjugative plasmids. sequence analysis revealed that in tn1546, orf1 had an 889-bp deletion and an is1216v insertion at the 5' end and an is1251 insertion between vans and vanh. to date, this particular form of tn1546 has only been described in human clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates unique to the united states. additionally, this is the first report of a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolated from a companion animal in the united states.

TI  == identification of vat(e) in enterococcus faecalis isolates from retail poultry and its transferability to enterococcus faecium.
AB  == sixteen isolates of enterococcus faecalis were recovered from retail poultry samples (seven chickens and nine turkeys) purchased from grocery stores in the greater washington, d.c., area. pcr for known streptogramin resistance genes identified vat(e) in five e. faecalis isolates (three isolates from chickens and  two isolates from turkeys). the vat(e) gene was transmissible on a ca. 70-kb plasmid, along with resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and streptomycin, by conjugation to e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium recipient strains. dna sequencing showed little variation between e. faecalis vat(e) genes from the chicken samples; however, one e. faecalis vat(e) gene from a turkey sample possessed 5 nucleotide changes that resulted in four amino acid substitutions. none of these substitutions in the vat(e) allele have previously been described.  this is the first report of vat(e) in e. faecalis and its transferability to e. faecium, which indicates that e. faecalis can act as a reservoir for the dissemination of vat(e)-mediated streptogramin resistance to e. faecium.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and faecalis (vre) remains a major complication among critically ill patients. a 26-year-old patient with 65% total  body surface area burns (tbsa) was infected with several e. faecium strains during his admission that were resistant to vancomycin. because chloramphenicol was the standard treatment at this time, this drug was initiated until, the organism was identified as e. faecium and reported as susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. given these data, it was then decided to discontinue the chloramphenicol therapy. quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy resulted in initial reduction of fever and white blood cell counts that continued over the next 5 days. however, on day 7 of quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy, a return of  fever and elevation of the white blood cell count was noted and a repeated e. faecium blood culture demonstrated sudden resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin (bauer-kirby zone size <14 mm). chloramphenicol was restarted and the patient improved slowly over a period of 16 days. our indigenous vre had limited exposure to quinupristin-dalfopristin in the recent past; however, resistance emerged with the first commercial use of this agent in our burn treatment center. high-dose chloramphenicol treatment did not appear to impair engraftment of cultured epithelial autografts (cea) in this patient.

TI  == enterococcal intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection: management and outcome of 61 consecutive cases.

TI  == analysis of the conjugal transfer system of the pheromone-independent highly transferable enterococcus plasmid pmg1: identification of a tra gene (traa) up-regulated during conjugation.
AB  == pmg1 (65.1 kbp) is a pheromone-independent enterococcus faecium conjugative plasmid conferring gentamicin resistance. pmg1 is able to transfer to enterococci at a high frequency in broth mating experiments, and it does not respond to the sex pheromones which are involved in the high-frequency transfer system of some conjugative plasmids in enterococcus faecalis. to analyze regulation of tra gene  expression in pmg1, transcripts of pmg1 were examined during conjugation. rna samples were prepared from mating mixtures 20, 40, 80, and 160 min after initiation of mating and were subsequently analyzed by northern hybridization by  using a variety of pmg1 dna fragments as probes. one transcript of gene 71orf2 increased to the maximal level 20 min after the start of mating. the level of this transcript decreased after 40 min of mating to the same level as the level in the control donor culture. the increase was not observed in cultures of the donor cells or recipient cells. these findings suggested that the increase was a  conjugation-specific event. the 71orf2 gene of pmg1 was disrupted by using the suicide vector pmg226 carrying an erythromycin resistance gene that is expressed  in enterococci. the transfer frequencies of mutant plasmid pmg229, which had a disrupted 71orf2 gene in pmg1, and the parent plasmid pmg1 were 1.6 x 10(-7) and  1.1 x 10(-3) per donor cell, respectively, in broth mating experiments, and the transfer frequencies of pmg229 and pmg1 were 2.7 x 10(-3) and 8.5 x 10(-2) per donor cell, respectively, in filter mating experiments. this indicated that the transfer frequency of plasmid pmg229 was reduced during broth mating and was not  altered during filter mating. 71orf2, which is designated traa, is a gene involved in the tra gene system for conjugation, and the product of this gene is  associated with the formation or stabilization of mating aggregates during broth  mating.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, with special attention to vancomycin, in 104 strains of enterococcus, which is the sentinel bacterium isolated from dog and cat faeces samples. the phenotypic characterization of the isolates classified them as e. faecium (58%),  e. avium (41%) and e. faecalis (1%). sensitivity testing used the diffusion method according to the recommendations of casfm (comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiogie), to oxacillin, amoxycillin, amoxycilin + clavulanic acid, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, imipenem, enrofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromicin  and vancomycin. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination by e test revealed a mic to vancomycin of between 0.5 microg/ml and 3 microg/ml. all the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, erythromycin, cefoperazone and oxacillin. we detected resistance to amoxycillin + clavulanic acid in 1.9% of isolates, to amoxycillin in 4.8%, to piperacillin in 13.5%, and to ampicillin in  21.2% of strains. a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance to lincomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was found in 98.1%, 95.2%, 76.9%, 73.1% and 64.4% of strains, respectively. resistance to vancomycin  was not found, which indicates that there is no transmission risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains to man or transfer of their resistance  genes to other bacteria belonging to the endogenous flora of humans.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == isolation of enterococcus species from infectious skin lesions.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis was isolated at a frequency of 70% and was chiefly isolated from secondary infections due to ulcer/decubitus. seven sole/predominant e. faecalis were isolated. penicillins were more effective against e. faecalis and the sensitivities of e. faecalis to antimicrobials were higher than those of e. faecium. some nonpredominant e. faecalis strains were sensitive to erythromycin probably due to less resistant mechanisms. the characterization of enterococcus spp. is especially important when choosing appropriate antimicrobials for therapy.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == possible connection between a widely disseminated conjugative gentamicin resistance (pmg1-like) plasmid and the emergence of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a total of 640 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates, which were obtained between 1994 and 1999 from the medical school hospital of the university of michigan, ann arbor, were used in this study. of the 640 strains, 611 and 29 were vana and vanb vre, respectively, based on pcr analysis. four hundred ninety-two (77%) of the strains exhibited resistance to concentrations of gentamicin from 64 micro g/ml (mic) to more than 1,024 micro g/ml (mic). the gentamicin resistance of each of 261 (53%) of the 492 gentamicin-resistant strains was transferred to e. faecium at a frequency of about 10(-5) to 10(-6) per donor cell in broth mating. more than 90% of vancomycin resistances of the 261 strains cotransferred with the gentamicin resistances to e. faecium strains by filter mating. the conjugative gentamicin resistance plasmids were identified  and were classified into five types (a through e) with respect to their ecori restriction profiles. the transfer frequencies of each type of plasmid between e. faecium strains or enterococcus faecalis strains were around 10(-3) to 10(-5) per donor cell or around 10(-6) to 10(-7) per donor cell, respectively, in broth mating. type a and type b were the most frequently isolated, at an isolation frequency of about 40% per vre isolate harboring the gentamicin resistance conjugative plasmid. the plasmids did not show any homology in southern hybridization with the pheromone-responsive plasmids and broad-host-range plasmids pambeta1 and pip501. the ecori or ndei restriction fragments of each type of plasmids hybridized to the conjugative gentamicin resistance plasmid pmg1 (65.1 kb), which was originally isolated from an e. faecium clinical isolate, and transfer efficiently in broth mating.

TI  == molecular analysis of streptogramin resistance in enterococci.
AB  == the new semi-synthetic streptogramin antibiotic combination quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a promising alternative for a treatment of infections with multiple resistant gram-positive pathogens, e.g. glycopeptide- and multi-resistant enterococcus faecium. streptogramins consist of two unrelated compounds, a streptogramin a and b, which act synergistically when given in combination. mechanisms conferring resistance against both components are essential for resistance against the combination in e. faecium. in this species resistance to streptogramin a compounds is mediated via related acetyltransferases vatd and vate. resistance against streptogramins b is either encoded by the widespread ermb gene cluster conferring resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b antibiotics or via expression of the vgba gene, which encodes a staphylococcal-type lactonase. e. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to streptogramins. due to a wide use of streptogramins (virginiamycins  s/m) in commercial animal farming a reservoir of streptogramin-resistant e. faecium isolates had already been selected. determinants for streptogramin resistance are localized on plasmids that can be transferred into an e. faecium recipient both in vitro in filter-matings and in vivo in the digestive tracts of  rats. hybridization and sequencing experiments revealed a linkage of resistance determinants for streptogramins a and b on definite plasmid fragments.

TI  == potential of enterococcus faecalis as a human fecal indicator for microbial source tracking.
AB  == regulatory agencies are interested in a fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans because human fecal contamination represents the greatest hazard to humans, yet is a relatively easy nonpoint source to remedy. watersheds  with human fecal contamination could be given first priority for cleanup. a fecal indicator bacterium with a host range limited to humans and a few other warm-blooded animal species would also simplify microbial source tracking because only a few animal species would be required for any host origin database. the literature suggests that the fecal indicator bacterium enterococcus faecalis has  a limited host range. on this basis, we selected this bacterium for study. of 583 fecal streptococcal isolates obtained on enterococcosel agar from canada goose, cattle, deer, dog, human, chicken, and swine, 392 were considered presumptive enterococci and were subsequently speciated with the api 20 strep system. of these isolates, 22 were ent. durans (5.6%), 61 were ent. faecalis (15.6%), 98 were ent. faecium (25.0%), 86 were ent. gallinarum (21.9%), and 125 were unidentified (31.9%). the host range of the ent. faecalis isolates was limited to dogs, humans, and chickens. media were developed to isolate and identify ent. faecalis quickly from fecal samples and this scheme eliminated ent. faecalis isolates from dogs. when the remaining ent. faecalis isolates were ribotyped, it  was possible to differentiate clearly among the isolates from human and chicken.  it may be that combining the potentially limited host range of ent. faecalis with ribotyping is useful for prioritizing watersheds with fecal contamination.

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. as the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. we evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. the combination of q-d with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 494. an improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against mrsa 494 was noted for cefepime plus either q-d or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis r444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. the combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 992). the combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vrefc) and e. faecium. q-d plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the vrefc isolate. the results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. combination regimens including cefepime, q-d, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == the prevalence of strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, cn staphylococci from 63 samples, e. coli from 49 samples, e. faecalis or e. faecium from 107 samples, and l. monocytogenes from two samples. bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (clt), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (cmp), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ery), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (str), tetracycline (ttc) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) characteristics (mic50, mic90, mic range) were determined for each microbial species. resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of  s. aureus, 40% of cn staphylococci, 73% of e. coli, 88% of e.faecalis, 55% of e.faecium, and one l. monocytogenes strain. most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to str, ttc, and ery (mic50 4 microg/ml). a high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. high resistance to clt was found in 11 strains of e. coli (mic 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to cmp (mic90 16 microg/ml) were detected. the highest numbers  of resistance phenotypes were found in e. coil (16) and cn staphylococci (12). eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria  (e. coli, e. faecalis, e. faecium) and pathogens (s. aureus, cn staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. the obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. this confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ery or  cmp. our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

TI  == [evaluation of microecology of colonic contents in patients with chronic pancreatitis].
AB  == the paper deals with microbiocenosis in the colonic content in 60 patients with chronic pancreatitis during its exacerbation. an analysis has indicated that in the colonic content there are the following microorganisms: bifidobacterium sp.,  10(8)-10(10) cfu/g; lactobacillus sp., 10(1)-10(5) cfu/g; escherichia coli, 10(8)-10(10) cfu/g; enterococcus faecalis, 10(6)-10(10) cfu/g; enterococcus faecium, 10(6)-10(10) cfu/g; the family enterobacteriaceae (mainly klebsiella-enterobacter sp.), 10(1)-10(6) cfu/g; yeasty (including the candida genus) and mold fungi, 10(1)-10(5)/g; staphylococci, 10(1)-10(3) cfu/g. comparing the findings with those of normal cenosis according to different authors' data suggests that there are no apparently impairments in the levels of some microoranisms, the representives of microbiocenosis in the colonic content in the examinees.

TI  == [enterococcal infections. clinical findings and treatment considering antibiotic  resistance in denmark].
AB  == enterococcus has become a more frequent cause of serious infections over the last 10-15 years. the infections are primarily nosocomial, owing to compromised immunity in the patients and excessive use of antibiotics in the hospitals. the rise is marked in the usa, where the enterococci furthermore tend to become multiresistant. abroad, many enterococci have developed resistance to all available antibiotics, and their spread is now controllable only by strict hygienic precautions. no increase in enterococcal infections has been noted in denmark, and very few clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci have  been found. because of the worldwide relevance, we present a review of enterococcal infections with the focus on endocarditis and bacteraemia. however,  we would emphasise that the classic combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside still provides adequate treatment of enterococcal infections in denmark.

TI  == an enterococcus faecalis abc homologue (lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (cli) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin a resistance") of e. faecalis was associated with  a > or =40-fold decrease in mics of q-d (to 0.75 microg/ml), cli (to 0.12 to 0.5  microg/ml), and dalfopristin (dal) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type e. faecalis parental strain (q-d mic, 32 microg/ml; cli mic, 32 to 48 microg/ml; dal mic, 512 microg/ml). complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the mics of cli, q-d, and dal to wild-type levels. under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of e. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. among 19 erm(b)-lacking enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to cli (mic, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had dal mics of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the  remaining erm(b)-lacking e. faecium strains, the cli and dal mics were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, none of 32 erm(b)-lacking e. faecalis strains were susceptible (cli mic range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; dal mic range, > or =32 microg/ml). when lsa was introduced into an e. faecium strain initially susceptible to cli, the mics of cli and dal increased > or =60-fold and that of q-d increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). introduction of lsa into two  dal-resistant (mics, > 128 microg/ml), q-d-susceptible (mics, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) e. faecium strains (cli mics, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the q-d mics from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the  predicted lsa protein to abc proteins such as vga(a), vga(b), and msr(a) of staphylococcus aureus and yjca of lactococcus lactis and the presence of walker a and b atp-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. in conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of e. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to cli and q-d.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

AB  == interactions between quinupristin-dalfopristin and six other antimicrobials were  examined by checkerboard arrays against 50 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium selected to represent a range of susceptibilities to individual agents. unequivocal synergistic or antagonistic interactions at clinically relevant concentrations were infrequently encountered  when the streptogramin was combined with chloramphenicol, ampicillin, imipenem, vancomycin, or teicoplanin. combinations with doxycycline resulted in synergistic inhibition in 36% of checkerboards. against 10 strains of enterococcus faecalis,  synergistic interactions were found when quinupristin-dalfopristin was combined with doxycycline (four strains), either glycopeptide (three strains), or ampicillin (two strains). combination with quinupristin-dalfopristin increased the ampicillin mic from 1 to 4 microg/ml for one strain. for 10 strains of e. faecium, interactions were also assessed by time-kill methods using concentrations of the agents attainable in human serum. most of these antimicrobials augmented killing by quinupristin-dalfopristin to a minor degree.  against 2 of the 12 strains in this collection that were not highly resistant to  gentamicin, the combination of quinupristin-dalfopristin (2 microg/ml) plus gentamicin (5 microg/ml) resulted in killing approaching 3 log(10) cfu/ml. with the exception of doxycycline, inhibitory interactions between quinupristin-dalfopristin and other agents tested against vancomycin-resistant strains of e. faecium were uncommon at clinically relevant concentrations.

TI  == proficiency of italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of enterococcus species from urinary tract infections.
AB  == objective: to determine the extent of drug-resistance among enterococcus species  in, in vitro experiments. test strains were isolated from cases with urinary tract infection. antimicrobial sensitivity was determined with particular reference to the beta-lactams, glycopeptide and aminoglycoside groups of antibiotics. methods: studies were carried out on pure cultures of enterococci isolated from urine specimens of 147 patients. freshly voided, aseptically collected, midstream specimens of urine were cultured by using standard techniques. the identification and speciation of the strains of enterococci were  performed by employing a battery of tests. in vitro drug-susceptibility tests of  enterococci were performed against the following antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, ampi-sulbactum, co-amoxi-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, gentamicin and streptomycin, by employing the disk diffusion method. mic values for penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin against enterococci were determined by the agar dilution technique. mic determinations were further carried out by the e-test method, for the glycopeptide antibiotics.  prevalence of high level resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics was determined  by the agar dilution method. results: the most common species isolated was e. faecalis (87.07%), followed by e. faecium (10.88%) and e. durans (2.05%). the magnitude of resistance to both penicillin and ampicillin among the enterococcus  spp. was 23.13%, and that to ciprofloxacin was 55.78%. the three antibiotics: nitrofurantoin, co-amoxi-clavulanate, and ampi-sulbactum, showed resistance of 0.78%, 8.16% and 2.72%, respectively. high-level aminoglycoside resistance among  strains of enterococci for streptomycin and gentamicin was found to be 33.84% and 36.92%, respectively. all the strains were susceptible to the glycopeptide antibiotics tested. conclusion: the emergence of enterococci with alarming rates  of resistance concomitantly to penicillins and aminoglycosides highlights the need for a more rational and restricted use of antimicrobials, in order to minimize the selection and spread of such strains. an early detection of these problem pathogens is also important for preventing any treatment failures.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis acetoacetyl-coenzyme a thiolase/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase, a dual-function protein of isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis.
AB  == many bacteria employ the nonmevalonate pathway for synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the monomer unit for isoprenoid biosynthesis. however, gram-positive cocci exclusively use the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for their growth (e. i. wilding et al., j. bacteriol. 182:4319-4327, 2000). enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are thus potential targets for drug intervention. uniquely, the enterococci possess a single open reading frame, mvae, that appears to encode two enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, acetoacetyl-coenzyme a thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase. western blotting revealed that the mvae gene product is a single polypeptide in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus hirae. the mvae gene was cloned  from e. faecalis and was expressed with an n-terminal his tag in escherichia coli. the gene product was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. as predicted, the 86.5-kda mvae gene product catalyzed both the acetoacetyl-coa thiolase and hmg-coa reductase reactions. temperature optima, deltah(a) and k(m)  values, and ph optima were determined for both activities. kinetic studies of acetoacetyl-coa thiolase implicated a ping-pong mechanism. coa acted as an inhibitor competitive with acetyl-coa. a millimolar k(i) for a statin drug confirmed that e. faecalis hmg-coa reductase is a class ii enzyme. the oxidoreductant was nadp(h). a role for an active-site histidine during the first  redox step of the hmg-coa, reductase reaction was suggested by the ability of diethylpyrocarbonate to block formation of mevalonate from hmg-coa, but not from  mevaldehyde. sequence comparisons with other hmg-coa reductases suggest that the  essential active-site histidine is his756. the mvae gene product represents the first example of an hmg-coa reductase fused to another enzyme.

AB  == the study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and mic/disk test comparisons of bms284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 2000. isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the sentry program (2000), the bms284756 mic90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and <  or = 4 microg/ml were: staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. the activity of bms284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. excellent correlation was observed between the mic and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of enterococcus faecalis, 25% of e. faecium, and 76% of other enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. all vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; 11 e. faecalis and 15 e. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of bms284756. among the non-vre, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. bms284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than vre and e. faecium. acceptable correlations were observed between mic and disk test results for both  tested genus groups.

TI  == postoperative enterococcal infection after treatment of complicated intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == background: the prevalence of enterococcal isolation and factors associated with  postoperative enterococcal infection remain ill defined. methods: a prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted of consecutive patients with a first episode of intra-abdominal infection and a positive microbiological culture who did or did not develop a postoperative septic complication involving enterococci. the prevalence of initial enterococcal isolation was determined for  each focus of infection. postoperative enterococcal infections were related to whether appropriate (piperacillin--tazobactam), suboptimal (carbapenems) or inappropriate (cefotaxime plus metronidazole) antienterococcal therapy had been administered empirically. results: enterococci were isolated in 42 (21 per cent)  of the 200 patients investigated. the isolation rates were 11 per cent for community-acquired peritonitis, 50 per cent for postoperative peritonitis and 23  per cent for intra-abdominal abscesses of both origins. no enterococci were isolated from 49 patients with perforated appendicitis. independent factors for postoperative enterococcal infection were type of intra-abdominal infection (p =  0.006), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score greater  than 12 (p = 0.04) and inappropriate empirical antibiotic cover (p = 0.05). postoperative enterococcal infections were associated with a high mortality rate  (21 versus 4 per cent; p < 0.0007). conclusion: enterococci are frequently isolated from intra-abdominal infections of non-appendiceal origin and are often  involved in postoperative infectious complications, particularly peritonitis. empirical antibiotic therapy covering enterococcus faecalis should be contemplated in some circumstances.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of faecal enterococci in poultry, poultry farmers and poultry slaughterers.
AB  == the prevalence of resistance in enterococci to antibiotics, commonly used for therapy in poultry or as antimicrobial growth promoters (amgps), was determined in faecal samples of two chicken populations: broilers in which antibiotic and amgp use is common and laying-hens with a low antibiotic usage. in addition faecal samples were examined from three human populations: broiler farmers, laying-hen farmers and poultry slaughterers. mics of an extended panel of antibiotics for a randomly chosen gentamicin- or vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolate from each faecal specimen were also determined. the prevalence of resistance for all antibiotics tested was higher in broilers than in laying-hens. resistance in faecal enterococci of broiler farmers was for nearly all antibiotics higher than those observed in laying-hen farmers and poultry slaughterers. the overall resistance in broilers was correlated with the  resistance in broiler farmers and in poultry slaughterers. no correlation between the results obtained in the laying-hens with any of the other populations was found. the 27 gentamicin-resistant isolates all showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and two of these isolates, both enterococcus faecium, were resistant to all antibiotics tested, except vancomycin. the 73 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated from the five populations belonged to four different species and in all isolates the vana gene cluster was detected by blot hybridization. the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns of these vancomycin-resistant enterococci were quite heterogeneous, but enterococcus hirae isolates with the same or a closely related pfge pattern were isolated at two farms from the broiler farmer and from broilers. molecular characterization of vana-containing transposons of these isolates showed that similar transposon types, predominantly found in poultry, were present. moreover, similar vana elements were not only found in isolates with the same pfge pattern but also in other vre isolated from both humans and chickens. the results of this study suggest transmission of resistance in enterococci from animals to man. for vre this might be clonal transmission of animal strains, but transposon transfer seems to occur more commonly.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == a protocol for polymerase chain reaction detection of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from the root canal.
AB  == aim: the present study was set up to develop a protocol for detection of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from the root canal. methodology:  a collection of type strains and clinical isolates ol e. faecalis and faecium was used. specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers targeted against the 16s/23s rdna intergenic region were used and pcr reactions were set up. pcr products were run on tbe-agarose gel and analysed. the sensitivity of the pcr systems was studied using serial dilutions of (i) bacterial dna and (ii) bacterial cells from e. faecalis. the specificity of the identification was tested against closely related species. results: all strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium produced identical amplicon profiles composed of two major bands corresponding to sizes of 320 and 420 bp. when amplifying dna of higher purity, a third band of 600 bp became evident as well. closely related species demonstrated single bands of various sizes and were easily distinguished from enterococci. the detection level of dna from serial dilutions of dna was 10(-13) g. the dna extraction protocol from bacterial cell suspensions resulted in a detection level of 10 bacterial cells per sample. conclusions the present study demonstrated a good potential for using pcr technology in the detection of f. faecalis and e. faecium from root canal samples. with a high specificity the methodology was able to detect 10 cells of e. faecalis.

TI  == resuscitation rate in different enterococcal species in the viable but non-culturable state.
AB  == aims: the viable but non-culturable (vbnc) state is a survival strategy adopted by bacteria when exposed to environmental stress. when in this state bacteria are no longer culturable on conventional growth media, but cells display metabolic activity and maintain pathogenicity factors/genes and, in some cases, resuscitation from the vbnc state has been shown. this state has been described for both human pathogens and faecal pollution indicators. in this study, we present evidence for entry of different enterococcal species into the vbnc state  in an oligotrophic microcosm. methods and results: the duration of the viability  of the cells in the vbnc state was measured either by detecting the presence of pbp5 mrna or by quantifying their resuscitation capability. enterococci showed different behaviours. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus hirae entered into the vbnc state within 2 weeks and remained in that state for 3 months. in the experiments described the resuscitation rate was 1:10 000 cells as soon as the cells entered the vbnc state and decreased gradually to undetectable levels over  the following 3 months. enterococcus faecium, however, remained culturable up to  4 weeks. after this time period, when the population was totally unculturable, the cells were far less resuscitable than other enterococci and only over a narrow time interval (2 weeks). conclusions: these results suggest that ent. faecalis and ent. hirae enter the vbnc state but that ent. faecium, in an oligotrophic laboratory environment, tends to die instead of entering the vbnc state. significance and impact of the study: these experiments may mimic what happens when enterococci are released by humans and animals in natural environments.

TI  == identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopeptide resistance  in german and austrian clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  == objective: to determine exactly how german and austrian routine laboratories perform tests for the identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopoptide resistance. methods: six enterococcal test strains with different types of glycopeptide resistance (enterococcus faecium, vana; e. faecalis, vana;  e. faecium, vanb; e. faecalis, vanb; e. gallinarum, vanc1; e. casseliflavus, vanc2) were sent as anonymous isolates to 73 clinical microbiology laboratories (65 in germany; eight in austria). the participating laboratories had to identify the strains up to the species level and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin by the test method(s) that are used daily in the corresponding laboratories. results: the analysis of the results received from 62 laboratories (56 from germany, six from  austria) demonstrated that the most used routine method in susceptibility testing was the agar diffusion test, followed by the etest, and the microbroth dilution procedure. the majority of participants had no difficulties in susceptibility testing with the vana-type strains. however, the agar diffusion test was often not able to recognize clearly the vanb and vanc strains; some problems also arose with vanb isolates in the etest. with the microbroth dilution method, the corresponding type of glycopeptide resistance was correctly determined in the majority of enterococcal test strains. difficulties also arose in identification, especially with the vanc strains (e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus), which were often falsely identified as e. faecium. the reasons for these errors are obviously based on the lack of important tests (such as motility and presence of  a yellow pigment) in some commercially available identification test kits.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == the prevalence of faecal carriage of ampicillin-resistant and high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci among inpatients at 10 major norwegian hospitals.
AB  == from march to october 1999, 854 patients hospitalized at 10 major norwegian hospitals were screened for rectal carriage of ampicillin-resistant enterococci (are) and high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci (hlgre). a total of 59 are  carriers (prevalence 6.9%, range 0-22% among hospitals) and 28 hlgre carriers (prevalence 3.3%, range 1-11%) were detected. all are or hlgre strains were susceptible to vancomycin, whereas 77% of the are isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. all the are strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, and 48% of these were genomically closely related as shown by pfge. specific point mutations in the pbp5 gene were associated with reduced susceptibility to ampicillin. the adjusted risk of becoming a carrier of are was related to the use of glycopeptides [odds ratio (or) = 4.8], the use of any antimicrobial agent (or  = 3.1) and more than one hospital admission during the last six months (or = 2.0). twenty-five of 28 hlgre isolates were enterococcus faecalis. the aaca/aphd  genes were detected in 26 (93%) and the apha3 in 19 (68%) of the hlgre isolates.  sixty-four percent of the hlgre isolates belonged to two pfge clusters. consumption of antimicrobial agents was also a significant risk factor for hlgre  colonization (or = 5.4), while prescription of penicillins was associated with reduced risk (or = 0.28).

TI  == survival of enterococci during hospital laundry processing.
AB  == much remains to be elucidated about the epidemiology of nosocomial enterococcal infections. enterococci are, however, known to be relatively thermotolerant, and  several studies have shown that under laboratory conditions many strains are able to survive the time/temperature combinations of the uk department of health recommendations for the decontamination of used linen (hsg(95)18). we therefore wished to investigate the efficacy of decontamination of enterococci from hospital linen in working hospital laundries. the thermotolerance of 40 strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium was first determined. reduction by a factor of greater than 10(5) was achieved in only two of 40 strains after 3  min at 71 degrees c or 10 min at 65 degrees c, the time/temperature combinations  specified by the department of health for the disinfection of used linen. during  experimental challenge of 10 working hospital laundries, however, we demonstrated successful decontamination of laundry artificially contaminated with enterococci. this was shown to take place during the washing stage. our study suggests that, despite the relative thermotolerance of enterococci, the time/temperature combinations specified in hsg(95)18 should be adequate for their decontamination  in hospital laundries.

AB  == this paper presents the results of the identification and determination of alive  microorganisms in the air samples collected from the breath zone of workers employed in the waste collection and disposal. samples were taken during waste collection and in the waste reloading, sorting and composting plants. in addition, samples were taken at stationary sites: in the city and inside flats. different kinds of species of gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus, staphylococcus, enterococcus, bacillus, listeria, corynebacterium, rhodococcus) and gram-negative rods (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas and other aerobic bacteria) were found. on every work site, there were fecal bacteria (escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium). the city areas and flats were free from this kind of bacteria. the number of mesophilic bacteria and thread-like fungi exceeding 10(4) cfu/m3 of air was counted on every work site. the largest number of mesophilic bacteria and actinomycetes were found in the waste composting plant (10(4)-10(6) and 10(3)-10(5) cfu/m3, respectively), whereas the majority of fungal spores were counted during waste collection and sorting. (10(4)-10(5) cfu/m3). on the city streets there were no actinomycetes and the number of fungal spores (10(4)/m3 of air) was similar to that observed in the waste reloading and composting plants. the amount of mesophilic bacteria in the city and flat samples was below 10(2)-10(3) cfu/m3. as to the number of fungal spores and actinomycetes there was a limit of determination (10(1)-10(2) cfu/m3). the majority of mesopholic bacteria identified in the air were classified as the second group of occupational risk in the council directive 54/2000/eu. bearing in mind that gram-negative rods (especially intestinal) were  identified in all samples, it is suggested to use endotoxin concentration as one  of possible criteria for assessing the hygiene conditions at workplaces.

TI  == treatment options for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
AB  == serious infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) usually occurs in patients with significantly compromised host defences and serious co-morbidities, and this magnifies the importance of effective antimicrobial treatment. assessments of antibacterial efficacy against vre have been hampered by the lack  of a comparator treatment arm(s), complex treatment requirements including surgery, and advanced illness-severity associated with a high crude mortality. treatment options include available agents which don't have a specific vre approval (chloramphenicol, doxycycline, high-dose ampicillin or ampicillin/sulbactam), and nitrofurantoin (for lower urinary tract infection). the role of antimicrobial combinations that have shown in vitro or animal-model in vivo efficacy has yet to be established. two novel antimicrobial agents (quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid) have emerged as approved therapeutic options for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium on the basis of in vitro susceptibility and clinical efficacy from multicentre, pharmaceutical company-sponsored clinical trials. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a streptogramin,  which impairs bacterial protein synthesis at both early peptide chain elongation  and late peptide chain extrusion steps. it has bacteriostatic activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium [minimum concentration to inhibit growth of 90% of isolates (mic(90)) = 2 microg/ml] but is not active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90 )= 16 microg/ml). in a noncomparative, nonblind, emergency-use programme in patients who were infected with gram-positive isolates resistant or  refractory to conventional therapy or who were intolerant of conventional therapy, quinupristin/dalfopristin was administered at 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours. the clinical response rate in the bacteriologically evaluable subset was 70.5%, and a 65.8% overall response (favourable clinical and bacteriological outcome) was observed. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin on therapy was observed in  6/338 (1.8%) of vre strains. myalgia/arthralgia was the most frequent treatment-limiting adverse effect. in vitro studies which combine quinupristin/dalfopristin with ampicillin or doxycyline have shown enhanced killing effects against vre; however, the clinical use of combined therapy remains unestablished. linezolid, an oxazolidinone compound that acts by inhibiting the bacterial pre-translational initiation complex formation, has bacteriostatic activity against both vancomycin resistant e. faecium (mic(90) = 2 to 4 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (mic(90) = 2 to 4 microg/ml). this agent was studied in a similar emergency use protocol for multi-resistant gram-positive infections. 55 of 133 evaluable patients were infected with vre. cure rates for the most common sites were complicated skin and soft tissue 87.5% (7/8), primary  bacteraemia 90.9% (10/11), peritonitis 91.7% (11/12), other abdominal/pelvic infections 91.7% (11/12), and catheter-related bacteraemia 100% (9/9). there was  an all-site response rate of 92.6% (50/54). in a separate blinded, randomised, multicentre trial for vre infection at a variety of sites, intravenous low dose linezolid (200mg every 12 hours) was compared to high dose therapy (600 mg every  12 hours) with optional conversion to oral administration. a positive dose response (although statistically nonsignificant) was seen with a 67% (39/58) and  52% (24/46) cure rate in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively. adverse effects of linezolid therapy have been predominantly gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), headache and taste alteration. reports of thrombocytopenia  appear to be limited to patients receiving somewhat longer courses of treatment (>14 to 21 days). linezolid resistance (mic > or = 8 microg/ml) has been reported in a small number of e. faecium strains which appears to be secondary to a base-pair mutation in the genome encoding for the bacterial 23s ribosome binding  site. at present a comparative study between the two approved agents for vre (quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid) has not been performed. several investigational agents are currently in phase ii or iii trials for vre infection. this category includes daptomycin (an acidic lipopeptide), oritavancin (ly-333328; a glycopeptide), and tigilcycline (gar-936; a novel analogue of minocycline). finally, strategies to suppress or eradicate the vre intestinal reservoir have been reported for the combination of oral doxycyline plus bacitracin and oral ramoplanin (a novel glycolipodepsipeptide). if successful, a  likely application of such an approach is the reduction of vre infection during high risk periods in high risk patient groups such as the post-chemotherapy neutropenic nadir or early post-solid abdominal organ transplantation.

TI  == enterococcus spp. produces slime and survives in rat peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == enterococcal clinical isolates were investigated for the ability to form biofilm  on inert surfaces, as a measure of slime production, in an attempt to find new possible virulence factors for these microorganisms. this property was commonly found among enterococcus faecalis. also e. faecium isolates were able to form biofilm, although to a lesser extent; for this species, however, biofilm formation seemed more frequently associated with isolates from infection rather than with environmental strains or isolates from healthy individuals. biofilm formation was strongly affected by the presence of an additional carbohydrate source in the medium, or by iron deprivation, indicating a role of slime for survival in stressful conditions. slime-producing e. faecalis were able to survive inside peritoneal macrophages for extended periods compared to slime-negative strains or to slime-positive bacteria grown in conditions depressing slime production. in particular, slime-producing and slime-negative cells showed a decrease of 1 and 2 log units, respectively, at 1 h after infection; slime-negative cells were then rapidly killed, with clearance of bacterial cells at 24 h. slime-producing bacteria persisted up to 48 h, which was the last time point examined, as after that time viability of both infected and non-infected macrophages started to decline. scanning electron microscopy observations showed the presence of abundant amorphous extracellular material, of possible polysaccharide nature, embedding bacterial cells to form a multilayered  biofilm. even in conditions not supporting biofilm formation, bacterial cells appeared capsulated, suggesting that capsule and slime might represent different  structures. genes belonging to the epa locus or to a putative icaa homolog did not seem to be involved in synthesis and export of slime.

AB  == in this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices)  were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. the tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus.  both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of bacillus  pumilus, 3 isolates of enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates  of escherichia coli, 8 isolates of lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus. amplified dna fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of 62 distinct rapd types were categorized from the five genera studied. typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus in three patient pairs. genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.

TI  == invasive infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci in adult patients.
AB  == since 1990, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. invasive infections caused by these organisms have challenged most physicians because they are resistant to multiple antibiotics. we analyzed the clinical characteristics of adult patients with invasive vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections in the national taiwan university hospital from january 1993 through december 2000. a total of 11 adult patients were identified, 9 of whom had bacteremia (7 caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 2 by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium) and one each had thoracic empyema (vancomycin-resistant e. faecium) and peritonitis (vancomycin-resistant e. faecium). five patients had rectal swab cultures positive for vancomycin-resistant enterococci; 4 of them had underlying malignancies. the majority (91%) of these patients had prolonged hospitalization and prior long-term use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) or anti-anaerobic agents (clindamycin or metronidazole). the crude mortality rate was 64%. in conclusion, invasive infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci is an emerging problem among hospitalized patients in taiwan, particularly those with severe underlying diseases and exposure to multiple antibiotics.

TI  == persistence of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in an anaerobic continuous-flow culture of porcine microflora in the presence of subtherapeutic concentrations of vancomycin.
AB  == recombined porcine continuous-flow culture (rpcf) maintained in a continuous-flow fermentation system is effective in protecting neonatal and weaned pigs against infection by enteropathogens. in the current study, we demonstrate the effect of  rpcf on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the presence and absence of subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin. also examined was the ability of vre to transfer vancomycin resistance to endogenous enterococcus faecalis 137.1. when rpcf was challenged with vre, the rate of vre clearance was dependent on the method of challenge. in the control experiment, rpcf was challenged with 7.0 log10/cfu/ml vre. clearance of vre from the culture was observed within 7 days at a rate of 1.44 log10/day. rpcf containing 0.001 microg/ml vancomycin cleared vre  at a slightly lower rate of 0.94 log10/day. rpcf containing 0.01 microg/ml or 0.1 microg/ml vancomycin reduced the level of vre from 7.0 log10/cfu/ml to 2.0 log10/cfu/ml within 9 days, but failed to clear the vre after 24 days. during the period of decline, the vre clearance rate for the 0.01 microg/ml and 0.1 microg/ml vancomycin-treated cultures was 0.52 log10/day, and 0.53 log10/day, respectively. e. faecalis 137.1 endogenous to rpcf did not acquire the vancomycin resistance genes throughout the experiment as evidenced by direct selection, ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. tested by etest.
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains, 22 staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 enterococcus faecium strains, 23 enterococcus avium strains, 27 streptococcus  pneumoniae strains, 22 streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 streptococcus agalactiae strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of everninomicin were determined by etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and  minocycline. the etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (mic, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. the antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against s. aureus and s. epidermidis was  stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against mrsa, with an mic50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an mic90 of 0.5 microg/ml. against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.

TI  == in vitro activity of cephalosporin rwj-54428 (mc-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (pbp) pbp 2' (pbp 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as  epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. the mic at which  50% of isolates are inhibited (mic(50)) and mic(90) of rwj-54428 for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. the mic(50) and mic(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. the highest mics for mrsa and mrcons isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the mic(50) and mic(90) of rwj-54428 for enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for enterococcus faecium. for penicillin-susceptible,  -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the mic(90)s of rwj-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest mic for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime mics were 8 and 4 microg/ml. mics for lancefield group a, b, c, and g streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. rwj-54428 did not select resistant mutants of mrsa or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.

TI  == enterococcal diversity in the environment of an irish cheddar-type cheesemaking factory.
AB  == enterococci are natural residents of human and animal intestinal tracts and grow  to high levels in a variety of artisanal cheeses. the aim of this study was to determine the diversity of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese production  unit. putative enterococci were isolated from the faeces of all the cows and all  the people associated with the cheesemaking, from the milk and cheese during manufacture and ripening and from the environment in three separate trials. almost 1400 isolates were screened using a genus-specific primer. the results indicated that all the human, milk, curd and cheese isolates but only 33.7%, 6.7% and 4.4% of the bovine isolates from the three trials, respectively, were members of the genus enterococcus. rapd-pcr was used to type the enterococcal isolates. in general, only e. faecium was found in the bovine faeces while e. casseliflavus dominated the human faeces, milk and cheese followed by lower numbers of e. faecalis. environmental sampling of the water in the milking parlour and rinses of the cows' teats, the bulk-milk storage tank and the milking machine corroborated these results as e. casseliflavus and e. faecalis were the only enterococcus species found in these samples. the putative vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), isolated in trial 1, were shown to be pediococcus spp. by genotypic and phenotypic analysis.

TI  == [utilization of exogenous siderophores by enterococci].
AB  == the study was undertaken to investigate the ability of enterococci to assimilate  iron via siderophores of bacteria living in the same habitats in the human organism. the potential recipients of exogenous siderophores were six enterococcus faecalis and six enterococcus faecium strains, isolated from clinical materials of human origin. the donors of siderophores were gram-negative rods (various species of the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas and acinetobacter) and gram-positive cocci (various species of staphylococcus and streptococcus). all of the investigated e. faecium and only two e. faecalis strains demonstrated  the ability to utilize the siderophores of the aforementioned bacterial groups, predominantly the chelators of gram-negative rods, those of gram-positive cocci were utilized to a smaller extent. four recipient strains from e. faecalis species did not demonstrate the ability to utilize siderophores synthesized by all of 40 investigated donor strains.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of linezolid tested against vancomycin-resistant  enterococci isolated in brazilian hospitals.
AB  == the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) has been described recently in brazil. this is in contrast to the usa and europe, where the vre appeared in the late 1980s. the progressive increase in vre isolation poses important problems in the antimicrobial therapy of nosocomial infections. treatment options and effective antimicrobial agents for vre are often limited and the possibility of transfer of vancomycin genes to other gram-positive microorganisms continues. in the search for antimicrobial agents for multiresistant gram-positive cocci, compounds such as linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin have been evaluated. the present study was conducted to evaluate the in vitro activity of the oxazolidinone linezolid and 10 other antimicrobial agents, including quinupristin-dalfopristin, against multiresistant enterococci isolated in brazilian hospitals. thirty-three vancomycin resistant isolates (17 enterococcus faecium and 16 e. faecalis), were analyzed. strains were isolated from patients at sao paulo hospital, oswaldo cruz hospital, hospital do servidor publico estadual, santa marcelina hospital, santa casa de misericordia de sao paulo, and hospital de clinicas do parana. the samples were tested by a broth microdilution method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommendations. all isolates were molecular typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). linezolid was the  most active compound against these multiresistant enterococci, showing 100% inhibition at the susceptible breakpoints. quinupristin/dalfopristin and teicoplanin showed poor activity against both species. the molecular typing results suggest that there has been interhospital spread of vancomycin resistant  e. faecium and e. faecalis among brazilian hospitals. the results of this study indicate that linezolid is an appropriate therapeutic option for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections in brazil.

TI  == salt resistance and synergistic effect with vancomycin of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide p18.
AB  == p18 (kwklfkkipkflhlakkf-nh(2)) is an alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide designed from a cecropin a-magainin 2 hybrid. in this study, p18 was found to show strong  antimicrobial activity against several antibiotic-resistant bacterial and fungal  strains. both the salt resistance on antimicrobial activity and the synergistic effect with clinically used antibiotic agents are critical factors in developing  effective peptide antibiotic drugs. for this reason, we investigated the salt resistance of p18 to antagonism by nacl, cacl(2), and mgcl(2) on antimicrobial activity and the synergistic effect of p18 with vancomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref). compared to magainin 2, p18 showed strong resistance on antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains and  c. albicans under high nacl concentrations of 100-200 mm. in addition, p18 displayed much greater salt resistance on antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria at the physiological or elevated concentrations of cacl(2) and mgcl(2) than magainin 2. furthermore, the combination study revealed that p18 has a relatively effective synergistic effect with vancomycin against vref. thus, these results support that p18 may prove to be a salt-resistant antibiotic peptide potentially useful in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients as well as a valuable adjuvant for antimicrobial chemotherapy.

TI  == implications of multiple antimicrobial-resistant enterococci associated with the  poultry environment.
AB  == poultry are increasingly being associated with carriage of multiresistant organisms that may cause disease in humans. among these organisms are the enterococci, not regarded as a common cause of hospital-acquired infections. the  use of antimicrobials for growth promotion in poultry production envronments may  facilitate the dissemination of resistance to enterococcus spp. that have the potential to be clinically significant. to assess descriptively the degree of multiresistant enterococci in the poultry environment of the delmarva (delaware-maryland-virginia) east coast region of the usa, litter samples from regional commercial poultry houses and transport container swabs from processing  facilities were cultured for enterococcus spp. using a microtiter plate adaptation of a conventional biochemical screen, the predominant species identfied were e. faecalis (61.2%), e. faecium (18.6%) and e. gallinarum (2.4%).  resistance to the cephalosporin, macrolide and tetracycline classes of antimicrobials was uniform with broader resistance to penicillin and derivatives  present in a majority of e. faecium isolates. high-level streptomycin resistance  was evident in close to 30% of all isolates with a majority of e. faecalis variants possessing resistance. high-level gentamicin resistance was detected at  a low frequency (2.6%) only within the e. faecalis group with resistance to low-level gentamicin levels present in a majority of both the e. faecalis group and subsets of e. faecium. no unexpected vancomycin resistance was detected. of particular interest was resistance to the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d or synercid), which was present in 70.4% of e. faecium and e. faecium variants.

TI  == epidemiology of the genetic elements responsible for acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci.
AB  == five genotypes of acquired glycopeptide resistance have been documented in enterococci, with vana and vanb being the most globally widespread and prevalent. resistance results from the production of peptidoglycan precursors with reduced binding affinity for glycopeptides and is encoded by complex clusters of van genes. the prototype vana element is tn1546, a 10.8-kb transposon that carries the vanrshaxyz genes. diverse vana elements exist, but all share the vanrshax cluster and are believed to be derived from a tn1546 progenitor. the sequences of these genes are remarkably conserved, with only a few point mutations identified. vana elements do however vary by the presence of deletions and insertion sequences (is) in nonessential genes (orf1, orf2, vany, and vanz) and intergenic  regions. is transposition probably plays a key role in vana element evolution. by contrast, vanb gene clusters show greater sequence divergence. three vanb alleles have been reported, of which vanb2 appears to be the most widespread, generally as part of tn5382 and related elements. to date, only four enterococcus faecium strains with vand resistance have been reported, and each contained a distinct vand allele. the vane and vang types have each been identified in single strains  of enterococcus faecalis. the existence of distinct genotypes, together with the  allelic nature of vanb and vand, suggests that van clusters have transferred to enterococci on multiple occasions from undefined donor species, with subsequent horizontal dissemination, particularly of vana and vanb elements, among enterococci. characterization of glycopeptide resistance elements yields information on their evolution and broadens our insights into the epidemiology of resistant enterococci.

TI  == enterococcal endocarditis in sweden, 1995-1999: can shorter therapy with aminoglycosides be used?
AB  == a 5-year nationwide prospective study in sweden during 1995-1999 identified 881 definite episodes of infective endocarditis. definite enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in 93 episodes (11%), the largest series of enterococcal endocarditis so far presented. mortality during treatment was 16%, the relapse rate was 3%, and clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 81% of the episodes. clinical cure was achieved with a median duration of cell wall-active antimicrobial therapy of 42 days combined with an aminoglycoside (median treatment time, 15 days). international guidelines generally recommend a 4-6-week combined synergistic treatment course with a cell wall-active antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. treatment regimens in sweden often include a shortened aminoglycoside treatment course in order to minimize adverse effects in older patients. fatal outcome seemed not to be due to the shortened aminoglycoside therapy course. in many enterococcal endocarditis episodes, duration of aminoglycoside therapy could probably be shortened to 2-3 weeks.

TI  == selection of a teicoplanin-resistant enterococcus faecium mutant during an outbreak caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci with the vanb phenotype.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have recently become an increasing problem in hospitals in poland, being responsible for a growing number of nosocomial outbreaks. in this work, we have analyzed the second outbreak of vre with the vanb phenotype to be identified in the country. it was caused by clonal dissemination of a single strain of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vres) and horizontal transmission of vancomycin resistance genes among several vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrem) strains. two similar restriction fragment length polymorphism types of the vanb gene cluster characterized vres and vrem isolates, and they both contained the same vanb2 variant of the vanb gene. two vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium (vsem) isolates, recovered from the same wards during the outbreak, proved to be related to certain vrem isolates and could represent endemic strains that had acquired vancomycin resistance. one vsem and four vrem isolates, all identified in the same patient, belonged to a single  clone, although they revealed remarkable diversity in terms of susceptibility, pfge patterns, plasmid content, and number of vanb gene cluster copies. most probably they reflected the dynamic evolution of an e. faecium strain in the course of infection of a single patient. one of the vrem isolates turned out to be resistant to teicoplanin, which coincided with the use of this antibiotic in the patient's therapy. its vanb gene variant differed by a single mutation from that found in other isolates; however, it also lacked a large part of the vanb gene cluster, including the regulatory genes vanr(b) and -s(b), and the vancomycin-inducible promoter p(yb). expression of the resistance genes vanh(b),  -b, and -x(b) was constitutive in the mutant, and this phenomenon was responsible for its unusual phenotype.

TI  == epidemiological analysis of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a large tertiary-care hospital in northern italy.
AB  == the epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) was studied in a large tertiary-care hospital in northern italy from february 1993 to december 1999. sixteen cases of bacteraemic and 17 cases of nonbacteraemic active infections caused by vre were recorded. fifteen of the bacteraemic and four of the nonbacteraemic infections occurred in patients in the haematology department, while the remainder were registered in other departments of the same hospital. active surveillance for the presence of vre in stools led to identification of 51 noninfected carriers over the 1994-1999 period; of these, 32 were haematology patients and the remainder were patients admitted to other departments. all vre isolates carried the vana gene. forty-one enterococcus faecium isolates and eight enterococcus faecalis isolates collected in the 1993-1996 period were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. twenty-nine isolates of enterococcus faecium shared either indistinguishable or strictly or possibly related patterns. of these, 26 were isolated from patients in the haematology department. this is believed to be the first study on the epidemiology of vre carried out in a large  hospital in italy over a period of several consecutive years. it reports an increase in vre due to the epidemic spread of genetically related strains and sporadic infections or colonisation by unrelated vre. it also documents the success of surveillance and of the measures adopted for preventing the spread of  vre in patients at risk.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was studied in comparison with other agents active against 328 recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens. mic data  showed that the addition of calcium ions to a final concentration of 50 mg/l enhanced the activity of daptomycin generally by eight- to 16-fold. in the presence of calcium ions daptomycin was uniformly active against the strains of staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. studied with a mic90 of < or = 1 mg/l. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were slightly less susceptible (mic90 2 mg/l). vancomycin-, fluoroquinolone- and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant strains were all susceptible to daptomycin. the presence of serum reduced the apparent activity of daptomycin to only a moderate extent. employing the bsac methodologies, a tentative breakpoint of 2 mg/l for daptomycin is proposed.

TI  == determinants of vancomycin resistance and mortality rates in enterococcal bacteremia. a prospective multicenter study.
AB  == background: enterococcus species are major nosocomial pathogens and are exhibiting vancomycin resistance with increasing frequency. previous studies have not resolved whether vancomycin resistance is an independent risk factor for death in patients with invasive disease due to enterococcus species or whether antibiotic therapy alters the outcome of enterococcal bacteremia. objective: to determine whether vancomycin resistance is an independent predictor of death in patients with enterococcal bacteremia and whether appropriate antimicrobial therapy influences outcome. design: prospective observational study. setting: four academic medical centers and a community hospital. patients: all patients with enterococcal bacteremia. measurements: demographic characteristics; underlying disease; acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores; antibiotic therapy, immunosuppression, and procedures before onset; and antibiotic therapy during the ensuing 6 weeks. the major end point was 14-day survival. results: of 398 episodes, 60% were caused by e. faecalis and 37% were caused by e. faecium. thirty-seven percent of isolates exhibited resistance or intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin. twenty-two percent of e. faecium isolates showed reduced susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin. previous vancomycin use (odds ratio [or], 5.82 [95% ci, 3.20 to 10.58]; p < 0.001), previous corticosteroid use (or, 2.43 [ci, 1.22 to 4.86]; p = 0.01), and total apache ii score (or, 1.06 per unit change [ci, 1.02 to 1.10 per unit change]; p = 0.003) were associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. the mortality rate was 19% at 14 days. hematologic malignancy (or, 3.83 [ci, 1.56 to  9.39]; p = 0.003), vancomycin resistance (or, 2.10 [ci, 1.14 to 3.88]; p = 0.02), and apache ii score (or, 1.10 per unit change [ci, 1.05 to 1.14 per unit change]; p < 0.001) were associated with 14-day mortality. among patients with monomicrobial enterococcal bacteremia, receipt of effective antimicrobial therapy within 48 hours independently predicted survival (or for death, 0.21 [ci, 0.06 to 0.80]; p = 0.02). conclusions: vancomycin resistance is an independent predictor  of death from enterococcal bacteremia. early, effective antimicrobial therapy is  associated with a significant improvement in survival.

TI  == quantitative determination of gelatinase activity among enterococci.
AB  == gelatinase, hemolysin and aggregation substance have all been reported to be virulence factors of enterococci. in this study, gelatinase production was investigated in isolates of enterococcus faecalis (n=93), e. faecium (n=49) and e. avium (n=36) recovered from hospitalized patients. gelatinase was detected in  45% of e. faecalis isolates, but could not be detected in e. faecium and e. avium. gelatinase activity was then measured by radial diffusion for the 42 gelatinase-positive e. faecalis isolates. to convert gelatinase activity into proteinase k activity, a standard curve was produced by placing different concentrations of proteinase k into wells in the gelatine plate. gelatinase activity per e. faecalis colony ranged from 2.6 x 10(-7) to 2.2 x 10(-5) microg/ml, proportionate to the activity of proteinase k. an approximately 84-fold difference in gelatinase concentration was observed between the colony producing the highest amount and that producing the lowest amount. this method may be useful for determining the virulence of given isolates in relation to gelatinase production as it is quick, easy and inexpensive to perform.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == the penicillin resistance of enterococcus faecalis jh2-2r results from an overproduction of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein pbp4 and does not involve a psr-like gene.
AB  == a penicillin-resistant mutant, jh2-2r (mic 75 microg ml(-1)), was isolated from enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 (mic 5 microg ml(-1)) by successive passages on plates containing increasing concentrations of benzylpenicillin. a comparison of  the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) profiles in the two strains revealed a more  intensely labelled pbp4 in jh2-2r. because the sequences of the jh2-2 and jh2-2r  pbp4 genes were strictly identical, even in their promoter regions, this intensive labelling could only be associated with an overproduction of the low-affinity pbp4. no psr gene analogous to that proposed to act as a regulator of pbp5 synthesis in enterococcus hirae and enterococcus faecium could be identified in the vicinity of pbp4 in e. faecalis jh2-2 and jh2-2r. however, a psr-like gene distant from pbp4 was identified. the cloning and sequencing of that psr-like gene from both e. faecalis strains indicated that they were identical. it is therefore postulated that the pbp4 overproduction in e. faecalis jh2-2r results from the modification of an as yet unidentified factor.

TI  == [epidemiological study on vancomycin-resistant enterococci from fecal samples in  the east area of japan].
AB  == recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have become important nosocomial pathogens in the world. in japan, the vre-infection was first reported in 1996. however, an epidemiological study on vre has not been aggressively done in japan. we conducted a survey study to explore the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from fecal samples at 45 hospitals in the east area of japan (kanto, koshinetsu, tohoku, and hokkaido)  during june 1998 to march 1999. the enterococcosel agar containing vanocomycin (bbl) was used for screening vre from fecal samples in each hospital. the susceptibilities of the isolates to 8 antimicrobials were determined by the broth microdilution method and the definitions of resistance were based on current standards of the nccls standards. the vre genotypes (vana, vanb, vanc1, and van c2/3) were confirmed by amplifying the respective genes by pcr. eight hundred and ninety four strains of enterococci were tested by the microtiter plates hybridization method (wakunaga seiyaku, japan). one thousand five hundred eighty  three strains of enterococci were collected from 6,914 patients in 45 hospitals.  these strains included 72 (4.5%) strains enterococcus faecalis, 33 (2.1%) strains enterococcus faecium, 17 (1.1%) strains enterococcus avium, 1,040 (65.7%) strains enterococcus gallinarum, 386 (24.4%) strains enterococcus cassliflavus, and 35 (2.2%) strains enterococcus flavescens. these strains of vancomycin-resistant e.  faecalis were isolated from 3 patients, two of these 3 strains had van a gene and other one had van b gene. those 3 strains were in the kanto area, and 2 of 3 strains were in tokyo, generally, though van a type vre was highly resistaant to  both vancomycin and teicoplanin. in our study, two strains of van a type e. faecalis were highly resistant to vancomycin (mics > 128 micrograms/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin with mics 4 micrograms/ml. those two strains were different in susceptibilities of minocycline and ofloxacin. the result of the analysis of pfge had also different patterns. vanb type e. fecalis was highly resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin (mics 0.25 microgram/ml).  for ampicillin and imipenem, 3 strains of e. faecalis were susceptible (mic < or  = 1 microgram/ml). one of 562 strains of e. gallinarum had vanb and vanc1 genes and was moderately resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. all strains of e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens had vanc2/c3 gene only. all strains of e. faecium and e. avium did not detect van genes. from this result, it was supposed that vre were very rare in the east of japan.

AB  == pathogenic enterococci are becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for gram-positive infections. enterococci pose a significant public health threat, not least because of the risk of transferring vancomycin resistance to the ubiquitous staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin resistance is manifested by cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with altered termini that cannot bind the antibiotic. small molecules with well-oriented nucleophile-electrophile assembly and complementary chirality to the peptidoglycan termini were identified as catalytic and selective cleavers of  the peptidoglycan precursor depsipeptide. these molecules were tested in combination with vancomycin and were found to re-sensitize vancomycin-resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.

TI  == development of systemic bacteraemia after oral inoculation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice.
AB  == bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) is an important clinical problem because there are only a few potent antimicrobial agents against such bacteria. therefore, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of vre bacteraemia is important for prophylaxis. this study shows that treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide and a combination of metronidazole, kanamycin and vancomycin reduced normal intestinal flora and induced systemic vre bacteraemia.  translocation of vre and the normal intestinal flora to the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen and blood, and mortality rate were dependent on treatment with cyclophosphamide and each of the three antimicrobial drugs. among the different strains studied, c57bl/6 mice were the most susceptible to vre. the virulence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis was greater than that of  vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium. on the day after inoculation of vre, escherichia coli was also detected in many vre-positive specimens including blood, liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. moreover, both vre and e. coli were  detected simultaneously in almost all blood samples obtained from dead and dying  mice, and vre organisms outnumbered e. coli in those samples by 100:1 or more. these results indicate that changes in normal intestinal flora by administration  of antimicrobial drugs and severity of neutropenia induced by cyclophosphamide are important factors that contribute to the development of systemic vre bacteraemia. e. coli may be intimately associated with the establishment of vre translocation.

AB  == fifty-four enterococcus faecalis and 20 enterococcus faecium isolates from clinical and non-human sources in rome, italy, were characterized by antibiotic resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin was more frequent in e. faecium than in e. faecalis, whereas high-level resistance to aminoglycoside was found primarily in e. faecalis. multi-resistance was found primarily among clinical isolates, but was also observed among environmental isolates. common genotypes shared among clinical and environmental isolates were observed, however, the majority of isolates occurred as unique, source-specific clones. several pfge types were associated with shared features in their antibiotic resistance patterns; evidences of clonal spread between and within wards were also noted. this is the first report indicating clonal relatedness between human and environmental enterococci isolated in italy.

TI  == detection and typing of vancomycin-resistance genes of enterococci from clinical  and nosocomial surveillance specimens by multiplex pcr.
AB  == ninety-three clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) collected from nine hospitals in taiwan were examined for the presence of vana, vanb, vanc1, or vanc2/vanc3 genes by a multiplex pcr. forty-seven of these vre isolates were vana positive, 1 contained both vanc1 and vana, 40 harboured vanb,  2 were vanc1, and 3 were identified to be vanc2/vanc3. twenty-four vana isolates  were sensitive to teicoplanin and thus did not have a typical vana phenotype. five isolates with the vanc phenotype harboured vanb. none of the 40 clinically isolated vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium or e. faecalis and the vancomycin-resistant leuconostoc and pediococcus isolates were positive for any of the van genes. while performing nosocomial surveillance, vre were isolated from 47 of 467 rectal swabs by culture. compared with the conventional culture method, the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex pcr for detecting and identifying vancomycin-resistance genes in enterococci directly from culture-positive broth were 97.9% and 100%, respectively. the results suggest that genotypic characterization of vancomycin-resistance is necessary for all clinical vre isolates and that the multiplex pcr assay can be an alternative method for this purpose.

TI  == multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method: report of the zyvox antimicrobial potency study (zaps) in the united states.
AB  == the in vitro activity of linezolid against common gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. one hundred and six centers (31 states in us) tested recent clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. a total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21  mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. susceptibility (zone diameters,  > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. there were no differences in  linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. this susceptibility pattern for us medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received us food and drug administration indications for clinical use.

TI  == distribution of endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase amongst enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are becoming increasingly important nosocomial pathogens, a fact mainly attributed to their antimicrobial resistance profiles. however, the enzymic activities required for these organisms to proliferate in vivo have received little attention. enterococcus faecalis has been shown previously to produce an endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity which cleaves high mannose-type glycans in glycoproteins between the n-acetylglucosamine residues of the pentasaccharide core. this study investigated the distribution of this endoglycosidase activity amongst the other enterococcal species. ribonuclease b,  a high mannose-type glycoprotein, was used as a substrate and endoglycosidase activity was demonstrated by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry and high ph anion-exchange chromatography. endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity was present in 10 of the 18 enterococcal species isolated from both human and animal sources, including all e. faecalis strains. the most notable exception was the lack of this activity in all e. faecium isolates tested. all enterococcal species possessing endoglycosidase activity utilised the liberated glycans to support bacterial growth.

TI  == population dynamics and antagonistic potential of enterococci colonizing the phyllosphere of grasses.
AB  == aims: to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of enterococci colonizing  forage grass and their ability to produce bacteriocins. methods and results: enterococci could be detected on above-ground plant parts throughout the growing  season, with high continuity but low cell numbers (2.60 x 101-6.16 x 104 cfu g-1  fresh matter). a total of 750 strains were isolated and identified by their whole-cell protein patterns as enterococcus faecalis (7.9%), ent. mundtii (7.9%), ent. casseliflavus (5.5%), ent. faecium (5.2%) and ent. sulfureus (0.1%). the vast majority of the strains (69.7%) formed a homogeneous 16s rdna genotype that  differed from those of known enterococci. a screening for antagonistic activity using an agar spot test revealed that 18.4% of all isolates were potential antagonists. partially-purified proteins extracted from cell-free culture supernatant fluids of various species were characterized as ph- and heat-stable bacteriocins active against a wide range of lactic acid bacteria, clostridia and  listeria. the producing strains were antagonistically active even on 'phylloplane agar' at temperatures between 4 and 37 degrees c. conclusion: enterococci are a common part of the epiphytic microflora of grasses, displaying probably some antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: the results provide  new information on the distribution, species diversity and antagonistic potential of enterococci in the phyllosphere.

TI  == identification and antibiotic resistance of faecal enterococci isolated from water samples.
AB  == we have isolated 47 strains of presumptive faecal streptococci from different water samples. identification was made by the method of facklam et al. (1989). antibiotic resistance was studied on mueller-hinton agar. twelve antibiotics were tested. high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) and resistance to glycopeptides were studied. biochemical identification of presumptive faecal streptococci isolates gave the following results: 19 enterococcus faecalis, 12 e. faecium, 8 e. hirae, 4 e. durans and 4 e. mundtii. e. mundtii is not included among faecal enterococci. none of the strains were resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). three strains of enterococci showed hlar. two of them were isolated from coastal bathing waters and the other from wastewater. this suggests that water could contribute to spread of hlar enterococci and it should be a matter of concern for public health authorities.

TI  == comparative evaluation of penicillin, ampicillin, and imipenem mics and susceptibility breakpoints for vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == although imipenem has in vitro activity against enterococcus faecalis and food and drug administration-approved indications for treatment of infections caused by this microorganism, there are no nccls guidelines for susceptibility testing of imipenem versus enterococci. therefore, the in vitro activities of penicillin, ampicillin, imipenem, and vancomycin against 201 blood isolates of e. faecalis and 24 blood isolates of enterococcus faecium were compared. the susceptibility of isolates to penicillin or ampicillin accurately predicted the in vitro activity of imipenem. since the susceptibility of enterococci to imipenem can be  predicted by the results obtained by testing of penicillin or ampicillin, testing of imipenem by clinical laboratories probably is not necessary.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of enterococci in intensive care units in sweden evaluated by different mic breakpoint systems.
AB  == three hundred and twenty-two (322) clinical isolates were collected from patients admitted to intensive care units (icus) at eight swedish hospitals between december 1996 and december 1998. of the isolates, 244 (76%) were enterococcus faecalis, 74 (23%) were enterococcus faecium and four (1%) were other enterococcus spp. mics of ampicillin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid and evernimicin were determined by etest. susceptible and resistant isolates were defined according to the species-related mic breakpoints of the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac), the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) and the swedish reference group for antibiotics (srga). tentative breakpoints were applied for new/experimental antibiotics. multidrug resistance among enterococci in icus is not uncommon in sweden, particularly among e. faecium, and includes ampicillin resistance and concomitant resistance to fluoroquinolones. almost 20% of e. faecalis isolates showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and concomitant resistance to fluoroquinolones. vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found sporadically.  among the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid and evernimicin showed the best activity against all enterococcal isolates. there was good concordance between the bsac, nccls and srga breakpoints in detecting resistance. when applying the srga breakpoints for susceptibility, isolates were more frequently interpreted as intermediate. this might indicate earlier detection of emerging resistance using  the srga breakpoint when the native population is considered susceptible, but with the risk that isolates belonging to the native susceptible population will be incorrectly interpreted as intermediate.

TI  == effect of abolishment of the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion on  occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in fecal enterococci from food animals in  denmark.
AB  == from 1995 to 2000, a total of 673 enterococcus faecium and 1,088 enterococcus faecalis isolates from pigs together with 856 e. faecium isolates from broilers were isolated and tested for susceptibility to four classes of antimicrobial agents used for growth promotion as part of the danish program of monitoring for  antimicrobial resistance. the four antimicrobials were avilamycin, erythromycin,  vancomycin, and virginiamycin. major changes in the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion have occurred during the last 6 years in denmark. the government banned the use of avoparcin in 1995 and of virginiamycin in 1998. furthermore, the producers have voluntarily stopped all use beginning in 1999. the avoparcin ban in 1995 was followed by a decrease in the occurrence of glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium (gre) in broilers, from 72.7% in 1995 to 5.8% in 2000. the occurrence of glycopeptide resistance among isolates from pigs remained constant at around 20% from 1995 to 1997. it was shown that, in gre from pigs, the genes encoding macrolide and glycopeptide resistance were genetically linked and that, following the decrease in the use of tylosin during 1998 and 1999, the occurrence of gre in pigs decreased to 6.0% in 2000. from 1995 to 1997  the occurrence of erythromycin resistance among e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates from pigs was almost 90%. use of tylosin decreased considerably during 1998 and 1999, and this decrease was followed by decreases in the occurrence of resistance to 46.7 and 28.1% among e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates from pigs, respectively. erythromycin resistance among e. faecium isolates from broilers reached a maximum of 76.3% in 1997 but decreased to 12.7% in 2000 concomitantly with more limited use of virginiamycin. use of virginiamycin increased from 1995  to 1997 and was followed by an increased occurrence of virginiamycin resistance among e. faecium isolates in broilers, from 27.3% in 1995 to 66.2% in 1997. in january 1998 the use of virginiamycin was banned in denmark, and the occurrence of virginiamycin resistance decreased to 33.9% in 2000. use of avilamycin increased from 1995 to 1996 and was followed by an increase in avilamycin resistance among e. faecium isolates from broilers, from 63.6% in 1995 to 77.4% in 1996. since 1996 avilamycin usage has decreased, followed by a decrease in resistance to 4.8% in 2000. our observations show that it is possible to reduce the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in a national population of food animals when the selective pressure is removed. cases in which resistance to vancomycin was linked to resistance to erythromycin were exceptions. in such cases resistance did not decrease until the use of both avoparcin and tylosin was limited.

AB  == the inhibitory and bactericidal effects of telithromycin (hmr 3647, ru 66647) were compared with those of gentamicin, ampicillin, erythromycin, azithromycin and vancomycin against 74 strains of enterococci (34 enterococcus faecalis and 40 enterococcus faecium) by agar dilution, broth dilution, time kill assays and postantibiotic effect (pae). the telithromycin mic(90) for vancomycin-sensitive (vse) e. faecalis strains tested using the agar dilution method was 8 microg/ml.  for a different group of vse e. faecalis strains tested using the broth dilution  method it was 0.06 microg/ml the telithromycin mic(90)s for vancomycin-resistant  (vre) and vse e. faecium strains, determined using the agar dilution method, were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, while for a different set of vre and vse e. faecium strains tested using the broth macrodilution method, they were 32 and 16  microg/ml, respectively. telithromycin mbc(90)s for e. faecalis were 4-6 tubes higher and for e. faecium 3-5 tubes higher, respectively, than the mic(90)s. in time kill assays, telithromycin had bactericidal activity against only 1 of 7 e.  faecium strains; for all other e. faecium and e. faecalis strains, only inhibitory activity was demonstrated. neither synergy nor drug interference was observed when telithromycin was used in combination with ampicillin, vancomycin or gentamicin. at 10 times the mic, the pae of telithromycin against e. faecalis  was 2.8 h, while for e. faecium it was 1.6 h. telithromycin should be evaluated for therapy of enterococcal infections, including those caused by vre organisms.  however, because of the strain-to-strain variability in susceptibility to telithromycin, mic determinations are important, especially for erythromycin-resistant strains.

AB  == background: enterococcus spp. is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen. recent studies have documented the increasing importance of this pathogen in children, particularly in the hospital setting. our objective in this study was to report the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and  to determine the characteristics of high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) plasmids in enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates. methods: two hundred eighty-nine enterococcal isolates were collected during an 18-month period from a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in mexico city. isolates were screened for antibiotic resistance, including hlgr. high-level, gentamicin-resistant e. faecalis strains were selected for pulsed-field electrophoresis (pfge) typing and plasmid analysis. transferability of resistance markers was carried out using filter matings. results: seventy-six percent of isolates were e. faecalis, 10% were e. avium, 5.2% e. faecium, 5.2% e. raffinossus, 1.38% e. malodoratus, 0.6% e. hirae, and 0.6% e. casseliflavus. antimicrobial resistance was ampicillin and  penicillin 29%, imipenem 17%, and vancomycin 3%, hlgr 5%. the following 15 high-level, gentamicin-resistant isolates were identified: six e. faecalis; four  e. avium; three e. faecium, and two e. casseliflavus. five of the six e. faecalis isolates were different by pfge and transferred gentamicin and streptomycin resistance on filter membranes. transfer frequencies ranged from 8.2 x 10(-4) to  6.92 x 10(-5) transconjugants/recipient cell. the plasmid content of donors and transconjugants were homogeneous (one plasmid of 47 kb). conclusions: in this pediatric hospital, antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus spp. is common. frequency of high-level, gentamicin-resistant strains is low. mechanism of hlgr appears to be due to a single plasmid dissemination.

TI  == occurrence of the vana and vanc2/c3 genes in enterococcus species isolated from poultry sources in malaysia.
AB  == enterococcus species isolated from poultry sources were characterized for their resistance to antibiotics, plasmid content, presence of van genes and their diversity by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). the results showed that all isolates were multi-resistance to the antibiotics tested. ampicillin (15/70) followed by chloramphenicol (37/70) were the most active antibiotics tested against the enterococcus spp. isolates, while  the overall resistant rates against the other antibiotics were between 64.3% to 100%. all vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, e. durans, e. hirae and e. faecium isolates tested by the disk diffusion assay were positive in pcr detection for presence of vana gene. all e. casseliflavus isolates were positive for vanc2/c3 gene. however, none of the enterococcus spp. isolates were positive for vanb and  vanc1 genes. plasmids ranging in sizes between 1.1 to ca. 35.8 mda were detected  in 38/70 of the enterococcus isolates. when the genetic relationship among all isolates of the individual species were tested by rapd-pcr, genetic differences detected suggested a high genetic polymorphisms of isolates in each individual species. our results indicates that further epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the role of food animals as reservoir of vre and the public health significance of infections caused by enterococcus spp.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == comparison of statistical methods for identification of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium from randomly amplified polymorphic dna patterns.
AB  == thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many european cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr (rapd-pcr) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis (g. moschetti, g. blaiotta, m. aponte, p. catzeddu, f. villani, p. deiana, and s. coppola, j. appl. microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). in order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, rapd-pcr patterns were generated with a single primer (xd9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network, and bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). cluster analysis allowed the identification of s. thermophilus but not of enterococci. a bayesian network proved to be more effective than a multilayer perceptron or a radial basis function network for the identification of s. thermophilus, e. faecium, and e. faecalis using simplified rapd-pcr patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). the bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.

TI  == in vitro activity of 19 antimicrobial agents against enterococci from healthy subjects and hospitalized patients and use of an ace gene probe from enterococcus faecalis for species identification.
AB  == we tested 165 enterococcal isolates, biased toward vancomycin resistant (vr) isolates, collected during recent years from fecal samples of healthy subjects and clinical specimens of hospitalized patients (mostly from united states and some from europe) for susceptibility to 19 antimicrobials. nosocomial isolates, whether vr or not, were more often highly resistant to aminoglycosides and clindamycin than fecal isolates from healthy community volunteers and more often  resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, levofloxacin and, for e. faecium, ampicillin (93 vs. 0%). resistance rates were similar between nosocomial and community-fecal isolates for minocycline, rifampin and quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d). none of the 165 enterococci tested hybridized with aph(2'')-ic and aph(2'')-id probes for recently described gentamicin resistance genes and 37 of the 39 isolates with high level resistance (hlr) to gentamicin hybridized with an intragenic aac(6')-aph(2'') probe. of the two newer drugs tested, daptomycin mic90s were 0.25 microg/ml for e. faecalis and 1 microg/ml for e. faecium, regardless of their vancomycin resistance level or source. for q-d, none of 28 e. faecium from community based healthy subjects in the usa and 7 of 66 e. faecium from hospitalized patients in the united states were resistant. among these 7 q-dr united states isolates and 7 q-dr isolates from europe (mics of q-d of 4-8 microg/ml), none hybridized with vat(d) (formerly sata) and vat(e) (formerly satg) dna probes, indicating the involvement of other  mechanism/s of resistance in these isolates. we also demonstrated that an intragenic probe of the gene ace from e. faecalis showed specific hybridizations  to all e. faecalis isolates, suggesting the usefulness of this gene for identification of this species.

TI  == a hospital epidemic of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus: risk factors and control.
AB  == objective: to determine risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre)  colonization during a hospital outbreak and to evaluate centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)-recommended control measures. design: epidemiological study involving prospective identification of colonization and a  case-control study. setting: a university hospital. participants: patients on eight wards involved in outbreak from late 1994 through early 1995. methods: cases were matched by ward and culture date with up to two controls. risk factors were evaluated with four multivariate models using conditional logistic regression. the first evaluated proximity to other vre patients and isolation status. the second evaluated proximity to unisolated vre cases and three variables independently predictive after adjustment for proximity. the third evaluated seven significant univariate predictors in addition to proximity to unisolated vre in backward, stepwise logistic regression. the fourth assessed proximity to vre with all other variables collected, clustered in a principal components analysis. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to assess clonality of two outbreak strains. results: the incidence of transmission declined significantly after cdc guidelines were implemented. proximity to unisolated vre cases during the prior week was a significant predictor of acquisition in each of four multivariate models. other significant risk factors in multivariate models included a history of major trauma and treatment with metronidazole. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the clonality of two outbreak strains. conclusions: vre was transmitted between patients during a hospital epidemic, with proximity to previously unisolated vre patients being an  important risk factor. weekly surveillance cultures and contact isolation of colonized patients significantly reduced spread

TI  == [vancomycin-resistant enterococci(vre)].
AB  == the incidence of enterococcal nosocomial infection has increased since 1980s. most enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many kinds of antibiotics, therefore, therapeutic drugs for enterococal infectious disease are limited to a  few antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin. however, since the first report of penicillinase producing e. faecalis in 1983, ampicillin-resistant strains have been increasing, furthermore, these strains often associated with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. the yearly usage of vancomycin increased because vancomycin was only effective drug against such resistant strains and worldwide spread of multidrug-resistant mrsa which vancomycin is only effective. however, high-level vancomycin-resistance strains of e. faecium were first isolated in england in 1986. in 1990s, vre have been spreading all over the world, especially, the emergency of multidrug-resistant strains, which are resistant to high concentrations of ampicillin or gentamicin or to vancomycin in  usa, brought serious therapeutic dilemmas. this review focuses on the background  in emergence of vre, the relation with use of avoparcin, is used for growth promotion in farm animals, the mechanism of resistance, and the prevention of the spread of vancomycin resistance.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == differences in antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium strains isolated from farm and pet animals.
AB  == the prevalence of acquired resistance in 146 enterococcus faecium and 166 enterococcus faecalis strains from farm and pet animals, isolated in 1998 and 1999 in belgium, against antibiotics used for growth promotion and for therapy was determined. acquired resistance against flavomycin and monensin, two antibiotics used solely for growth promotion, was not detected. avoparcin (glycopeptide) resistance was found sporadically in e. faecium only. avilamycin resistance was almost exclusively seen in strains from farm animals. resistance rates were higher in e. faecium strains from broiler chickens than in strains from other animal groups with tylosin and virginiamycin and in e. faecalis as well as in e. faecium strains with narasin and bacitracin. resistance against ampicillin was mainly found among e. faecium strains from pets and was absent in  e. faecalis. tetracycline resistance occurred most often in strains from farm animals, while enrofloxacin resistance, only found in e. faecalis, occurred equally among strains from all origins. resistance against gentamicin was very rare in broiler strains, whereas resistance rates were high in strains from other origins. it can be concluded that resistance against antibiotics used solely for  growth promotion was more prevalent in e. faecium strains than in e. faecalis strains. with few exceptions, resistance against the different categories of antibiotics was more prevalent in strains from farm animals than in those from pets.

AB  == enterococcus sp. k-4, with a bacteriocin-like activity against e. faecium, was isolated from grass silage in thailand. morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic studies clearly identified strain k-4 as a strain of e. faecalis. strain k-4 produced a maximal amount of bacteriocin at 43-45 degrees c. we purified, for the first time, the bacteriocin produced at high temperature by e.  faecalis to homogeneity, using adsorption on cells of the producer strain and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. the bacteriocin, designated enterocin se-k4, is a peptide of about 5 kda as measured by sds-page, and mass spectrometry analysis found the molecular mass of 5356.2, which is in good agreement. the amino acid sequencing of the n-terminal end of enterocin se-k4 showed apparent sequence similarity to class iia bacteriocins. enterocin se-k4 was active against e. faecium, e. faecalis, bacillus subtilis, clostridium beijerinckii, and listeria monocytogenes. enterocin se-k4 is very heat stable.

TI  == molecular screening of enterococcus virulence determinants and potential for genetic exchange between food and medical isolates.
AB  == enterococci are used as starter and probiotic cultures in foods, and they occur as natural food contaminants. the genus enterococcus is of increased significance as a cause of nosocomial infections, and this trend is exacerbated by the development of antibiotic resistance. in this study, we investigated the incidence of known virulence determinants in starter, food, and medical strains of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans. pcr and gene probe strategies were used to screen enterococcal isolates from both food and medical sources. different and distinct patterns of incidence of virulence determinants were found for the e. faecalis and e. faecium strains. medical e. faecalis strains had more virulence determinants than did food strains, which, in turn, had more than did starter strains. all of the e. faecalis strains tested possessed multiple determinants (between 6 and 11). e. faecium strains were generally free of virulence determinants, with notable exceptions. significantly, esp and gele determinants were identified in e. faecium medical strains. these virulence determinants have not previously been identified in e. faecium strains  and may result from regional differences or the evolution of pathogenic e. faecium. phenotypic testing revealed the existence of apparently silent gele and  cyl genes. in e. faecalis, the trend in these silent genes mirrors that of the expressed determinants. the potential for starter strains to acquire virulence determinants by natural conjugation mechanisms was investigated. transconjugation in which starter strains acquired additional virulence determinants from medical  strains was demonstrated. in addition, multiple pheromone-encoding genes were identified in both food and starter strains, indicating their potential to acquire other sex pheromone plasmids. these results suggest that the use of enterococcus spp. in foods requires careful safety evaluation.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in lebanon.
AB  == there is little information on the types of enterococcus spp and their antibiotic resistance patterns in lebanon. one hundred and fifty-three consecutive clinical  enterococcal isolates collected between 1998 and 1999 were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents using disk diffusion and the etest. the isolates were identified by conventional methods and api-strep and were found to consist of enterococcus faecalis (72.5%), enterococcus faecium (22.9%), enterococcus avium (3.2%) and enterococcus gallinarum (1.3%). the percent of resistant strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium respectively were, ampicillin 0.9 and 14%, erythromycin 59% and 40%, tetracycline 72% and 34%, chloramphenicol 32 and 11%, rifampin 36% and 57%, ciprofloxacin, 23% and 34%, norfloxacin 22 and 8%. high level aminoglycoside (hla) resistance was found in 19% e. faecalis and 9% e. faecium for gentamicin and 36% and 26% for streptomycin. excellent correlation was observed between the high level disk tests and the etest in the detection of hla  resistance but not with the regular disks. none of the isolates showed resistance to vancomycin or teicoplanin except for one e. gallinarum isolate which showed intermediate resistance (mic 16 mg/l) to vancomycin. these variable antimicrobial rates of resistance suggest a surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance in this country would be helpful to help control infection, guide empirical antibiotic therapy and implement a policy of antibiotic usage.

TI  == detection and characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in farm animals and raw meat products in italy.
AB  == the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in europe has been ascribed to the long-time use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin as feed additive in food animals, until its ban in 1997 in eu. the pres- ence of vre in food of animal origin is believed to represent a potential risk for the consumer. we studied the fecal carriage of vre in broiler chickens and slaughter pigs in italy before the avoparcin ban and eval- uated the impact of avoparcin withdrawal on the presence of vre in raw meat products. broilers and pigs were both found to be frequently colonized by vre, as 36% and 24.6% of the flocks or the herds, respec- tively, were positive. molecular typing of vre strains by pfge showed that animals housed in different pens within the same farm were colonized by clonally related strains. after the avoparcin ban, a decrease in the rate of vre  contamination in meat products was observed. such a decrease was statistically significant in poultry (from 18.8% to 9.6%) but not in pork products (from 9.7% to 6.9%). the majority of vre from all sources carried the vana resistance gene and included enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, and e. gallinarum. none of the strains carried the vanb gene, whereas constitutively resistant vanc-positive strains were frequently found. our results show that avoparcin withdrawal has been successful in reducing vre contamination in meat products. however, this measure needs to be complemented by a prudent use of glycopeptide antibiotics in human medicine.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and species identification for clinical isolates of  enterococci.
AB  == in order to describe the susceptibility patterns and determine the identities of  enterococcus spp. isolated at a regional teaching hospital in taichung during the period from june through november 1998, 96 clinical isolates of enterococci were  collected for further analysis. major sources of these isolates included urine, wound, and pus. species identification was performed using the api 20 strep system and supplemental tests. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of six antimicrobial agents were determined by e-test for each isolate. disk diffusion tests were also performed and the results were compared with those reported by the clinical laboratory. because gentamicin susceptibility tests showed inconsistent results in many isolates, mic determinations by the microbroth dilution method were also performed for these isolates. all isolates were tested for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic method. the results showed that enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently encountered species (86.5%), followed by enterococcus faecium (7.3%), enterococcus avium (5.2%) and enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%). the mic90 of ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin for total isolates were 1, 3, 2, 0.25, 1, and more than 1024 microg/ml, respectively. all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the same rate of resistance (3.1%) was found to penicillin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin in all isolates. there were 50 (52%) and 48 (50%) isolates with high level streptomycin  and gentamicin resistance, respectively. the mic90 of ampicillin and penicillin for e. faecium were significantly higher than those for other species (96 and > 256 vs. < or = 1 and < or = 3 microg/ml, respectively); in fact, ampicillin or penicillin-resistance was only found in e. faecium. no organism was found to produce beta-lactamase. there were 29 isolates showing discrepant results between the study findings and clinical laboratory report for gentamicin susceptibility.  most isolates (27/ 29) reported as susceptible to gentamicin by the clinical laboratory showed a high level gentamicin resistance by mic determinations. the inconsistent results may be due to discrepancy in interpretations for heterogeneous resistance, bias in selecting colonies for the disk diffusion test, or variation in the quality of mueller-hinton agar used. the results suggest that any pure isolates growing some colonies within the inhibition zone should be considered as gentamicin resistant even if the zone diameter is equal or greater  than the susceptible breakpoint. in order to obtain accurate results, the gentamicin mic should be determined by the dilution method for enterococcal isolates that yield intermediate inhibition zones or zones just above the susceptible limit.

(< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an mic50 of 32 mg/l and an mic90 of 64 mg/l. moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (din 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. these results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

TI  == vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoids.
AB  == the development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci (vre) is  a major cause for concern. here we show that a combination of galangin or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with vancomycin may be used to sensitize resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strains. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and viable counts were determined in iso-sensitest broth using a microtitre method. mics of  vancomycin against 67% of resistant clinical isolates and a type strain of enterococci were lowered from > 250 microg ml(-1) to < 4 microg ml(-1) in the presence of galangin (12.5 microg ml(-1)) or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone (6.25 microg ml(-1)). viable counts for type culture e. faecalis atcc 51299 showed the flavonoids alone significantly lowered numbers of colony forming units (cfus). cfus were maintained at low levels (< 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) for 24 h by vancomycin/flavone combinations. this combinational action in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimes against resistant pathogens.

TI  == analysis of the bacterial strains isolated from urine samples of hospitalized and ambulatory patients.
AB  == bacteria of enterococcus spp. are now much more often isolated from various diagnostic materials in systemic infection, both in hospitalized and in ambulatory patients. the study included 571 enterococci strains isolated from urine in 1997. species identification was performed by rapid id32 strep test (biomerieux) for 327 analyzed strains. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium dominated (46.1% and 11.2%, respectively). over 42% of strains were isolated from urine of patients with non-significant bacteriuria or as concomitant flora. in such cases, simplified identification was performed and the strains were determined as enterococcus spp. the microorganisms analyzed originated primarily from the urine samples of patients hospitalized at the department of urology (41.8%), the department of neurology (11.9%) and the department of internal medicine and nephrology (9.9%). enterococcus faecalis strains were second with respect to population count (263--10.6%), after escherichia coli strains (464--18.8%), while enterococcus faecium strains were the sixth (64--2.5%). enterococcus genus took the first place among all microorganisms isolated from the urine samples. antibiotic-sensitivity was determined for 323 enterococci strains originating from hospitalized and ambulatory patients. enterococcus faecium strains, naturally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, were sensitive to nitrofuranoin in more than 50% and to  norfloxacin in about 20%. among 254 analyzed enterococcus faecalis strains, 80.0% were sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and high concentrations of gentamicin as well as streptomycin. enterococci strains isolated from hospitalized patients proved sensitive to ampicillin and carbapenems in 76.8%, while strains isolated from ambulatory patients were 100% sensitive to these drugs. examination of enterococci isolated from urine of patients hospitalized showed 33.8% sensitive to norfloxacin and 84.6% sensitive to nitrofurantoin. all  the enterococci strains were sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics: vancomycin, teicoplanin.

TI  == bacteriocin production in vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus isolates of different origins.
AB  == bacteriocin production was determined for 218 enterococcus isolates (enterococcus faecalis [93] and e. faecium [125]) obtained from different origins (human clinical samples [87], human fecal samples [78], sewage [28], and chicken samples [25]) and showing different vancomycin susceptibility patterns (vancomycin resistant, all of them vana positive [56], and vancomycin susceptible [162]). all enterococcal isolates were randomly selected except for the vancomycin-resistant  ones. a total of 33 isolates of eight different bacterial genera were used as indicators for bacteriocin production. forty-seven percent of the analyzed enterococcal isolates were bacteriocin producers (80.6% of e. faecalis and 21.6%  of e. faecium isolates). the percentage of bacteriocin producers was higher among human clinical isolates (63.2%, 81.8% of vancomycin-resistant isolates and 60.5%  of vancomycin-susceptible ones) than among isolates from the other origins (28 to 39.3%). only one out of the 15 vancomycin-resistant isolates from human fecal samples was a bacteriocin producer, while 44.4% of fecal vancomycin-susceptible isolates were. the bacteriocin produced by the vana-containing e. faecium strain  rc714, named bacteriocin rc714, was further characterized. this bacteriocin activity was cotransferred together with the vana genetic determinant to e. faecalis strain jh2-2. bacteriocin rc714 was purified to homogeneity and its primary structure was determined by amino acid sequencing, showing an identity of 88% and a similarity of 92% with the previously described bacteriocin 31 from e.  faecalis yi717. the presence of five different amino acids in bacteriocin rc714 suggest that this could be a new bacteriocin. the results obtained suggest that the epidemiology of vancomycin resistance may be influenced by different factors, including bacteriocin production.

TI  == increasing prevalence of high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci isolated in greece.
AB  == high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci (hlgre) (mic >512 microg/ml) were frequently recovered in the ahepa university hospital, thessaloniki, greece, during a 15-month period (67/158, 42.4%). pcr testing showed that high-level gentamicin resistance was attributable to the presence of the aac(6')-aph(2") gene, while the recently described genes aph (2")-ic and aph(2")-id were not detected. high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred with varying frequency from 41 of 57 enterococcus faecalis and 5 of 10 enterococcus faecium isolates. all transconjugants acquired high-level resistance to streptomycin. hlgre cause therapeutic problems in our region, since none of the clinically available aminoglycosides can be used in severe infections.

TI  == routine molecular identification of enterococci by gene-specific pcr and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == for 279 clinically isolated specimens identified by commercial kits as enterococci, genotypic identification was performed by two multiplex pcrs, one with ddl(e. faecalis) and ddl(e. faecium) primers and another with vanc-1 and vanc-2/3 primers, and by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. for 253 strains, phenotypic and genotypic results were the same. multiplex pcr allowed for the identification of 13 discordant results. six strains were not enterococci and were identified by 16s rdna sequencing. for 5 discordant and 10 concordant enterococcal strains, 16s rdna sequencing was needed. because many supplementary  tests are frequently necessary for phenotypic identification, the molecular approach is a good alternative.

TI  == [surveillance of gram positive cocci susceptibility to betalactams, glycopeptides, and other antimicrobials].
AB  == background: during the last decade, there has been a progressive increase in the  resistance of gram (+) cocci to betalactamics and other antimicrobials. therefore, vancomycin and teicoplanin have incorporated as alternative antimicrobial drugs. aim: to assess the susceptibility of gram (+) cocci to different antimicrobials including vancomycin and teicoplanin. material and methods: we studied 447 strains of gram (+) cocci coming from ambulatory and hospitalized patients. these included 308 enterococcus sp strains, 99 staphylococcus aureus strains and 40 coagulase negative staphylococci strains. enterococci susceptibility was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in agar and that of staphylococci, through diffusion. susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in all strains. results: enterococcus faecalis was 100% susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, 23% susceptible to tetracyclin and 47% to chloramphenicol. susceptibility of e faecium was 61% to penicillin, 49% to chloramphenicol, 41% to tetracyclin, 100% to vancomycin and teicoplanin. of 19 enterococcus spp strains, 90% were susceptible to ampicillin,  80% to penicillin, 55% to chloramphenicol and 45% to tetracyclin. only one e casseiflavus strain had a low level resistance to vancomycin and was susceptible  to teicoplanin. no staphylococcus aureus strain was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. conclusions: a permanent surveillance of gram (+) cocci antimicrobial susceptibility is required to update therapeutic schemes.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from the  root canal.
AB  == enterococci are occurring in opportunistic infections involving the oral cavity.  this study has identified enterococcal species in 29 endodontic infections undergoing treatment with ca (oh)2 dressings. the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 29 isolated enterococcal strains was determined. enterococcus faecalis was speciated for 26 isolates and enterococcus faecium for three isolates. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed enterococcal isolates resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole and tetracycline but sensitive to erythromycin and vancomycin. due to low sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, enterococci may be selected in root canals undergoing standard endodontic treatment and significantly contribute to endodontic treatment failures.

TI  == [the interchangeability of siderophores in the enterococcus genus].
AB  == the functional interchangeability of siderophores was tested among 62 strais belonging to 12 species of genus enterococcus. most investigated strains were from e. faecalis and e. faecium species. the majority of examined enterococcal strains appeared highly resistant to edda (ethylene-di-amine-di-ortho-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), therefore the group of sensitive strains involved only 11 used as indicator strains. the determination of interchangeability of siderophores within enterococcal strains was performed using edda-agar media into which the indicator strains were included. test colonies (donor strains) were applied to the surface of the media to determine whether the indicator organisms could obtain the required iron for growth by utilizing chelators from the test colony. only two strains: e. solitarius dsm 5634 and e. pseudoavium dsm 5632 did not demonstrate the ability to utilize siderophores synthesized by all investigated strains. the other tested indicator  strains appeared to be recipients of siderophores from 20-52 donor enterococcal strains. the ability to exchange siderophores in enterococci was found as the feature characterizing individual strains.

TI  == evaluation of phenotypic characteristics for differentiation of enterococcal species using an example based algorithm.
AB  == a computer based rule-generation system of inductive learning by logic minimization (illm) was used to determine the sufficient set of biochemical reactions and necessary conditions that have to be fulfilled for correct differentiation of enterococci recovered from humans. the simplest combination of physiological tests for differentiation enterococcus faecalis from all other enterococcal species consisted of only 3 reactions. reactions that tested the ability of acidification d-xylose, mannitol, l-arabinose and na-pyruvate were useful for delineation of both e. faecalis and e. faecium from all other enterococci. for differentiation of all 12 currently known clinically significant species of enterococci any one of 3 sets of nine tests suggested by illm could be used. the tests suggested by illm were applied to 153 isolates of enteroccoci recovered at our department of microbiology and all e. faecalis (138, 90.2%), e.  faecium (13, 8.5%) and e. avium strains (2, 1.3%) were correctly differentiated.

TI  == epidemiology of enterococcal bacteremia in a referral center for hepatobiliary diseases.
AB  == background: enterococcus faecium (efm) and enterococcus faecalis (efl) account for most infections which predominantly originate in the abdomen or the urinary tract. the objectives of this study were to compare the risk factors associated with efm and efl bacteremia patients and method: retrospective study of 64 efl and 27 efm bacteremia cases that occurred between january 1993 and december 1996  in a referral center for hepatobiliary diseases. results: univariate predictors of efm bacteremia, compared to efl, were an orthoptic liver transplantation (olt), use of steroids, admission in the hepatology service, a central vascular catheter and an abdominal source. forward regression models identified olt as the only independent risk factor for efm bacteremia (odds ratio, or = 4.320; p = 0.0064), and septic shock as the only predictor of a fatal enterococcal bacteremia (or = 13.152; p = 0.0003). molecular typing of efm isolates identified four small nosocomial clusters (of two to seven patients each) of efm bacteremia, involving primarily patients admitted to the intensive care unit or on the hepatology ward. conclusion: strategies are needed to prevent enterococcal bacteremia in patients with severe liver disease, especially those undergoing olt.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin: an overview.
AB  == synercid (rp 59500), the first injectable streptogramin antibiotic, is composed of two semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives, quinupristin and dalfopristin. individually, each component has bacteriostatic activity against staphylococci and streptococci, but together, the agents exhibit synergy, leading to bactericidal activity. the combination drug, however, is bacteriostatic against enterococcus faecium and has poor activity against enterococcus faecalis. despite a short half-life, an extended postantibiotic effect allows the agent to be dosed every 8-12 hours. both drugs are largely hepatically metabolized and excreted in  bile. although not metabolized by cytochrome p450 3a4, quinupristin-dalfopristin  can inhibit agents that are metabolized through this pathway. dosage adjustments  may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction. alterations in renal function have minimal effects on the agent's pharmacokinetics. adverse events include arthralgia, myalgias, and infusion-related pain. based on available data, quinupristin-dalfopristin appears to have a role in treating severely ill patients with infections due to multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility to everninomycin of gram-positive nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in germany.
AB  == background: gram-positive bacteria are increasingly found to be causative pathogens in nosocomial infections, and the occurrence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci as well as staphylococci has prompted the investigation of alternative antimicrobial agents active against these strains. everninomycin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic, has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to vancomycin. however, avilamycin, a related compound, has been used in europe as a growth promoter in animal food for years and concern has been raised that cross-resistance in clinical isolates may arise. methods: we studied a collection of 268 nosocomial gram-positive isolates from intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis, using standard in vitro susceptibility testing. results: it could be shown that all species tested were exquisitely sensitive to everninomycin (mic(90) of 0.38 microg/ml for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 microg/ml for enterococci and 0.75 microg/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci). furthermore, no difference could be observed between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or between enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: these results suggest that everninomycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients and that the use of a related substance as an additive in animal food has not yet promoted resistance in clinical isolates.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

AB  == a case-control study was performed between 1994 and 1996 in order to study the epidemiological, microbiological, clinical, and prognostic features of high-level vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. seventeen consecutive patients who  had clinically significant bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vana genotype: 16 enterococcus faecalis, 1 enterococcus faecium) were compared with 169 who had vancomycin-susceptible enterococcal bacteremia. the following were selected by multivariate analysis as independent risk factors that influenced the development of high-level vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia: prior glycopeptide therapy (p=0.049); inclusion in a hemodialysis program (p=0.046); prior therapy with corticosteroids or antineoplastic agents (p=0.029); and prior surgical treatment (p=0.022). the following other factors were selected by univariate analysis: tracheostomy (p=0.002); prolonged hospitalization (p=0.01); and any kind of puncture (p=0.02). the crude associated-mortality rate was 13.4%. gene amplification of vana was positive for  17 strains of enterococci. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna after  smai digestion of vana isolates revealed that one strain predominated (10 isolates), though at least four similar banding patterns were identified (6 isolates). the 16 strains closely related to the outbreak were investigated further. the surgical intensive care unit was the first and most involved service. the hospital outbreak of vana vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia occurred between 1994 and 1995 and was caused by enterococcus faecalis. this is believed to be the first and only such outbreak described in a  spanish hospital thus far.

TI  == glycopeptide resistance in enterococci.
AB  == the selective pressure resulting from the extensive use of antibiotics over the last 50 years has led to the emergence of bacterial resistance and to the dissemination of resistance genes among pathogenic microorganisms. consequently,  we are now at serious risk of suffering intractable, life-threatening infections. the progressive emergence and rapid dissemination of resistance to glycopeptides, the last resort for treating nosocomial infections with enterococci resistant to  usual antibiotics, constitute one of the most dramatic examples of such resistance. enterococci are normal human commensals, but are also a frequent cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections and nosocomial bacteremia. enterococcus faecalis causes 80 to 90% of human enterococcal infections, while enterococcus faecium accounts for most of the remainder. during the last decade,  our understanding of the genetics and biochemical basis of resistance to glycopeptides has increased greatly. furthermore, the application of molecular methods for the diagnosis of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci has provided new  insights into the epidemiology of enterococcal infections.

AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. a total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 996 enterococci. to ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. the prevalence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. the resistance rates to methicillin among s. aureus and cns were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with mrsa  rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. no glycopeptide resistance was seen in s. aureus, but 6.5% of cns isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than e. faecalis (0.5%) (p<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vana. the rate of penicillin resistance in  pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%),  with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. the prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by  mefe. all the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l. the modal mics of linezolid were 1 mg/l for cns and pneumococci, and 2 mg/l for s. aureus and enterococci. linezolid was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of gram-positive infections in hospitals.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

AB  == we used a mouse peritonitis model to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of telithromycin (hmr 3647) (tel) and erythromycin (ery) against four strains of enterococcus faecalis and three strains of enterococcus faecium with differing susceptibilities to tel. tel was highly active in vivo against ery-susceptible (ery(s)) and -intermediate (ery(i)) strains (mic of tel = 0.015 to 0.062 microg/ml) and showed less efficacy against ery-resistant (ery(r)) isolates (mic  of tel = 4 to 16 microg/ml), although this was overcome in part by a second subcutaneous dose. quinupristin-dalfopristin was also noted to have less efficacy against ery(r) versus ery(s) or ery(i) e. faecium strains, but this difference was reduced by intravenous administration. in conclusion, tel was more potent in  vivo against enterococci than was ery; its activity was lowered by the presence of erm(b)-mediated ery(r).

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobial agents against 360 clinical isolates from korea.
AB  == the emergence of multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant (mr) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococci,  and vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus (visa) has given new urgency to the development of new antimicrobial agents. one of these is quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d). we decided to determine the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated at two university hospitals in seoul to q/d and compare the results with eight other antimicrobial agents. we investigated 120 isolates of s. aureus including 49 mrsas and one visa, 120 isolates of coagulase  negative staphylococci (cns), 64 e. faecalis and 56 e. faecium, including seven strains of vr e. faecium. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for several antimicrobials, including vancomycin and q/d, were determined by broth microdilution. all s. aureus including visa were susceptible to q/d. q/d mic90 for both methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and mrsa was 0.25 g/ml. 49 (87.5%) of 56 e. faecium including six of seven vr e. faecium were susceptible to q/d. e. faecalis were not susceptible to q/d (only 1.5% susceptible), but were inhibited  by ampicillin (94% susceptible) or vancomycin (95%). cns was susceptible to q/d (96% susceptible) and vancomycin (100% susceptible). one of 38 staphylococci and  two of 17 e. faecium were tolerant to q/d. in conclusion, q/d showed excellent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci including mrsa, visa, and vr  e. faecium except e. faecalis, and may provide a valuable option for the treatment of infections caused by these emerging nosocomial pathogens of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == diversity of domain v of 23s rrna gene sequence in different enterococcus species.
AB  == the highly conserved central loop of domain v of 23s rna (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics. dna encoding domain v (590 bp) of several species of enterococcus was amplified by pcr. twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including enterococcus faecium (six isolates), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each).  for all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated  by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the sequence of domain v of the 23s rrna gene from e. faecium and e. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. the domain v sequences of e. durans and e. hirae were identical. this was also true for e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. e. avium differed from e. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from e. durans by 16 bases, and from e. malodoratus by 2 bases. e. avium differed from e. raffinosus by one base. despite the fact that domain v is  considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == random amplification of polymorphic dna versus pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai dna macrorestriction fragments for typing strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == genetic typing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) can be performed using a variety of methods, but comparative analyses of the quality of these methods are  still relatively scarce. we here compare random amplification of polymorphic dna  (rapd) analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna macrorestriction fragments as examples of two of the recent and well-accepted molecular typing methods. for the latter method, empirical guidelines for the interpretation of the dna fingerprints have been proposed in the international literature. based on our experimental analyses, we define similar criteria for rapd fingerprinting. a collection of 100 strains of vre, comprising enterococcus  faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, was assembled. fifty isolates were dutch, another 50  were isolated in the uk. strains were selected on the basis of previously determined putative identity, close relatedness or uniqueness. the strains were analysed using well-standardised rapd and pfge protocols. resulting fingerprints  were interpreted with computerised methods involving band positioning and we show that typing of vre by pfge and rapd generates highly congruent dna fingerprint clustering. when the proposed international criteria for interpretation of pfge fingerprints were applied in our case, 86% pfge homology as discriminating value  between close relatedness and uniqueness, a 75% homology cut-off for the comparison of the rapd-generated dna fingerprints revealed essentially identical  strain clusters. as a spin-off it is revealed that strains from the different species can be efficiently discriminated, that strains from the uk and the netherlands form separate clusters and that strains from veterinary origin can be identified separately as well.

TI  == genetic characterization of vang, a novel vancomycin resistance locus of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis strain wch9 displays a moderate level of resistance to vancomycin (mic = 16 microgram/ml) and full susceptibility to teicoplanin but is  negative by pcr analysis using primers specific for all known enterococcal vancomycin resistance genotypes (vana, vanb, vanc, vand, and vane). we have isolated and sequenced a novel putative vancomycin resistance locus (designated vang), which contains seven open reading frames, from this strain. these are organized differently from those of all the other enterococcal van loci, and, furthermore, the individual vang gene products exhibit less than 50% amino acid sequence identity to other van gene products.

AB  == to determine the validity of the rapid xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside  (mdg) fermentation tests in distinguishing enterococcus gallinarum from enterococcus faecium, 156 well-characterized clinical isolates of enterococci (55 e. gallinarum, 91 e. faecium, and 10 enterococcus faecalis isolates) known to be  of different clones were examined in a blinded fashion. species identification was confirmed by pcr of the ddl ligase genes of e. faecium and e. faecalis and the vanc1 gene of e. gallinarum. xylose tests were performed with d-xylose tablets by using a heavy bacterial suspension and were interpreted after 2 h of incubation. standard mdg fermentation tests were read after 24 h of incubation. the xylose fermentation test had a sensitivity of 98% (54 of 55) and a specificity of 99% (100 of 101) in distinguishing e. gallinarum from e. faecium and e. faecalis. the standard mdg test had a sensitivity of 100% (55 of 55) and a specificity of 95% (96 of 101) after 24 h. the xylose fermentation test is a simple method, easily incorporated into laboratory protocols, that distinguishes  e. gallinarum from e. faecium with high sensitivity and specificity in 2 h. the standard mdg test has high sensitivity and can be useful in ruling out the presence of e. gallinarum but requires overnight incubation.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == in vivo activities of evernimicin (sch 27899) against vancomycin-susceptible and  vancomycin-resistant enterococci in experimental endocarditis.
AB  == to assess the potential efficacy of evernimicin (sch 27899) against serious enterococcal infections, we used a rat model of aortic valve endocarditis established with either a vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis or a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strain. animals infected with either one of the test strains were assigned to receive no treatment (controls) or 5-day therapy with one of the following regimens: evernimicin 60-mg/kg of body weight intravenous (i.v.) bolus once daily, 60-mg/kg i.v. bolus twice daily (b.i.d.), 60 mg/kg/day i.v. by continuous infusion, or 120 mg/kg/day i.v. by continuous infusion. these regimens were compared with vancomycin at 150 mg/kg/day. in animals infected with e. faecalis, evernimicin at 120 mg/kg/day by continuous infusion significantly reduced bacterial counts in vegetations (final density, 5.75+/-3.38 log(10) cfu/g) compared with controls (8.51+/-1.11 log(10) cfu/g). in animals infected with 0.5 ml of an 8 x 10(7)-cfu/ml inoculum of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, both 60-mg/kg bolus once a day and b.i.d. dose regimens of evernimicin were very effective (viable counts, 3.45+/-1.44 and 3.81+/-1.98 log(10) cfu/g, respectively). vancomycin was unexpectedly active against infections induced with that inoculum. in animals infected with a 10(9)-cfu/ml inoculum of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, the evernimicin 60-mg/kg i.v. bolus b.i.d. reduced viable counts in vegetations compared with controls (6.27+/-1.63 versus 8.34+/-0.91 log(10) cfu/g; p<0.05), whereas vancomycin was ineffective. although resistant colonies could be selected in vitro, we were not able to identify evernimicin-resistant clones from cardiac vegetations. an unexplained observation from these experiments was the great variability in final bacterial densities within cardiac vegetations from animals  in each of the evernimicin treatment groups.

TI  == enterococci with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in new zealand.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the stools of hospitalized patients with possible antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. from 176 faecal samples collected during 1997 and 1998, 66 strains of enterococci were recovered using vancomycin enrichment techniques. only six of these displayed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8-12 mg/l). all vre were positive for the presence of the vanc gene. based on motility, pigment production and automated gram-positive identification (gpi vitek card), four of these six vre isolates were identified as enterococcus gallinarum. the remaining two isolates were non-motile and therefore were considered to be enterococcus faecium. however, 16s rdna sequence analysis and positive methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside tests indicated that they were non-motile species of e. gallinarum. this is consistent with the intrinsic, low-level vanc-1-mediated resistance associated with this species. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis comparisons between the vre indicated genetic relatedness between some strains. this work confirms that vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis are rare in new zealand.

TI  == outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a hospital in gdask, poland, due  to horizontal transfer of different tn1546-like transposon variants and clonal spread of several strains.
AB  == twenty-two vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (vre) isolates of the vana phenotype (21 enterococcus faecium isolates and 1 e. faecalis isolate), representative of a large outbreak that occurred in a hospital in gdansk, poland, were studied. all of the isolates demonstrated resistance to a wide variety of other antimicrobial  agents in addition to glycopeptides. several lines of evidence suggested that the outbreak most probably consisted of two epidemics that followed the independent introduction of vana determinants into two separate hematological wards of the hospital. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that isolates recovered in these wards possessed two different polymorphs of the highly conserved dna region encompassing the vanrshax genes and two distinct polymorph types of tn1546-like transposons, which contain these genes. according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data, the outbreak in the adult hematology ward (hw) was highly polyclonal, which suggested a major role for the horizontal transmission of tn1546-like elements among nonrelated strains of e. faecium and e. faecalis in this environment. on the other hand, the outbreak in the pediatric hematology ward (phw) was most probably due to the clonal spread of two epidemic e. faecium  strains, which had exchanged a plasmid carrying the tn1546-like transposon. restriction fragment length polymorphism studies of transposons and their insertion loci in plasmid dna have suggested that numerous isolates from both hw  and phw contained two or more copies of tn1546-like elements that underwent diversification due to various genetic modifications. the reported data demonstrated a very complex epidemiology of the first, and up to now the only, vana vre outbreak characterized in poland.

AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence and determinants of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in intensive care unit (icu), hematology-oncology, and hemodialysis patients in the netherlands. design: descriptive, multicenter study, with yearly 1-week point-prevalence assessments between 1995 and 1998. population: all patients hospitalized on the testing days  in icus and hematology-oncology wards in nine hospitals in the netherlands were included. methods: rectal swabs obtained from 1,112 patients were screened for enterococci in a selective broth and subcultured on selective media with and without 6 mg/l vancomycin. resistance genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. further characterization of vre strains was done by pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge). we studied possible determinants of vre colonization  with a logistic regression analysis model. determinants analyzed included gender, age, and log-transformed length of prior hospital stay. results: the results showed that 614 (55%) of 1,112 patients were colonized with vancomycin-sensitive  enterococci, and 15 (1.4%) of 1,112 carried vre. no increase in vre colonization  was observed from 1995 to 1998. eleven strains were identified as enterococcus faecium and four as enterococcus faecalis. all e faecium and one e faecalis carried the vana gene; the other e faecalis strains harbored the vanb gene. pfge  revealed that three vanb vre isolated from patients hospitalized in one single icu were related, suggesting nosocomial transmission. though higher age seemed associated with vre colonization, exclusion of patients with the nosocomial strain from the regression analysis decreased this relation to nonsignificant. duration of hospital stay was not associated with vre colonization. conclusion: vre colonization in dutch hospitals is an infrequent phenomenon. although nosocomial spread occurs, most observed cases were unrelated, which suggests the  possibility of vre acquisition from outside the hospital. prolonged hospital stay, age, and gender proved unrelated to vre colonization.

AB  == the objectives of the study were to observe the activity of ly333328, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide, compared to that of vancomycin against six strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, including four vancomycin-resistant strains. bacteria ingested by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) as well as extracellular bacteria were studied using a colony count method. the activity against intracellular bacteria was tested with the drugs present in  the extracellular medium, as well as after preincubating the pmn and removal of the drugs. ly333328 is active against the tested enterococci, regardless of their susceptibility to vancomycin, with mics of 1-2 mg/l. it is bacteriostatic against extracellular enterococci at concentrations of 2 microg/ml and above regardless of their resistance to vancomycin. after 4 h incubation at 10 mic, vancomycin-resistant strains of e. faecium and e. faecalis located intracellularly were reduced by 55% and 90%, respectively. even after preincubation and removal of the drug, ly333328 had an effect at 10 mic with a 20-30% reduction in the inoculum. the results suggest that in contrast to vancomycin, ly333328 is active against intracellular vancomycin-resistant enterococci, particularly e. faecalis, even after removal of the extracellular drug.

TI  == antibacterial activities of temporin a analogs.
AB  == temporin a (ta) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (flpligrvlsgil-nh2) found in the skin of the european red frog, rana temporaria. it has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. in this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural  characteristics of ta synthetic analogs were studied. for antibacterial activity  against s. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the n-terminal  amino acid of ta was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino  acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. in addition, there was little difference between the activities of ta and its all-d enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.

TI  == vancomycin resistance and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci in raw meat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate antimicrobial resistance, in particular to vancomycin, of enterococci in samples (100) of meat (beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, and pork) sold in retail outlets of catanzaro (italy). enterococci  were identified to the species level. antimicrobial susceptibility tests for a large spectrum of antibiotics including glycopeptides were performed by the disk  diffusion method. kappa statistic was used to evaluate associations of resistance to vancomycin with other antimicrobials. enterococci were isolated from 45% of the samples, mostly from chicken meat (65.4%). overall, 29% of samples were contaminated by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), whereas among those positive they represented 64.4% of isolates. higher prevalence of vancomycin resistance was found in chicken samples (76.5%). the overall resistance to teicoplanin (tre) was 30%, whereas among those positive, tre represented 66.7% of isolates. the most frequent isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (33.3%). resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was observed in 75% and 78.5% of e. faecium, and in 40% and 46.7% of e. faecalis, respectively. most strains were susceptible to ampicillin (80%), while 88.9% were resistant to methicillin. the most effective antimicrobials were imipenem (73.3%  susceptible) and rifampin (80%). the highest prevalence of resistance was for streptomycin (88.9%), tetracycline (84.4%), and erythromycin (75.6%). resistance  to vancomycin was significantly associated to methicillin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. further investigations about enterococcal colonization and infections in community and hospital subjects are needed.

TI  == prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of antibodies to a capsular polysaccharide  shared among vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens that are increasingly difficult to treat due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to antibiotics, including vancomycin. a recently described capsular polysaccharide (cp) isolated from enterococcus faecalis 12030 was used to evaluate the potential efficacy of active or passive immunotherapy regimens as adjunctive treatments. evaluation of protective efficacy was carried out in immunocompetent mice challenged intravenously (i.v.) with live enterococci. in nonimmune mice, i.v. inoculations  resulted in high levels of bacteria in kidneys, spleens, and livers 5 days after  challenge. mice immunized with four 10-microg doses of cp antigen/mouse were protected against challenge with the homologous e. faecalis strain. high-titer opsonic immunoglobulin g was also induced by immunizing rabbits with the purified cp, and passive transfer of this antiserum to mice produced significantly lower bacterial counts in organs than did normal rabbit serum or sterile saline. antibodies to the polysaccharide isolated from e. faecalis 12030 were protective  against enterococcus faecalis og1rf and against two serologically related, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium clinical isolates. antibodies to this cp antigen were also effective as a therapeutic reagent in mice when passive therapy was initiated 48 h after live bacterial challenge. these data indicate that cp antigens from enterococci are potential targets of protective antibodies  and that these antibodies may be useful for prophylaxis and treatment of enterococcal infections.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of novel anilinouracils which selectively inhibit dna polymerase iii of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the 6-anilinouracils are novel dgtp analogs that selectively inhibit the replication-specific dna polymerase iii of gram-positive eubacteria. two specific derivatives, imau (6-[3'-iodo-4'-methylanilino]uracil) and emau (6-[3'-ethyl-4'-methylanilino]uracil), were substituted with either a hydroxybutyl (hb) or a methoxybutyl (mb) group at their n3 positions to produce four agents: hb-emau, mb-emau, hb-imau, and mb-imau. these four new agents inhibited staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. time-kill assays and broth dilution testing confirmed bactericidal activity. these anilinouracil derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to currently available agents, validating replication-specific dna polymerase iii as a new target for antimicrobial development.

TI  == cost-effective algorithm for detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in surveillance cultures.
AB  == a study was undertaken to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective algorithm for the detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in surveillance cultures, because the incidence of vre outbreaks in institutions across canada has made continuous surveillance a necessity. enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis carry transferable resistance genes and hence are a problem for infection control. in laboratory surveillance, however, enterococcus  gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, which exhibit low-level nontransferable resistance, are also encountered and often create confusion in identification. included in this study were a total of 218 strains of enterococci and other streptococci isolated from surveillance cultures. conventional methods  were used to determine their biochemical activities, and speciation was attempted in 121 strains using a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method that utilized primers for the vana, b, c1, c2/c3 and ddl genes. the results indicated that by using only a few tests (gram stain, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, motility, xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside utilization), enterococcus faecium/faecalis strains could be accurately differentiated from enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus strains. for the 121 strains on which pcr was performed, there was a 100% correlation with the biochemical identification,  with the added advantage that the presence of van genes could be determined at the same time. the cost of identification using minimal biochemical testing and pcr was less than that of identification using automated systems or a battery of  conventional biochemical methods. the algorithm presented here may be used in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  == [multicenter study of resistance in enterococci. the role of teicoplanin. spanish group for study and surveillance of resistance].
AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial and community infections, especially the e. faecalis and e. faecium species. they often show intrinsic resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones, and acquired resistance to other antimicrobials, such as glycopeptides, has also been described. in order to test  the impact of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from infections, we carried out a multicenter study in 19 hospitals in spain. we verified whether resistance to a high concentration of aminopenicillins and aminoglycosides was high (30.86% for ampicillin, 32.32% for gentamicin at a 500 micrograms dose, 55.93% for streptomycin at a 1000 micrograms dose) while the resistance to glycopeptides was low (1.8% for vancomycin and 1% for teicoplanin). it was also shown that teicoplanin had greater intrinsic activity than vancomycin, with teicoplanin 0.5 mg/l inhibiting 86.1% of the strains studied, whereas only 12.8%  were inhibited with the same concentration of vancomycin.

TI  == comparison of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and resistance genes in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from humans in the community, broilers, and pigs in denmark.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolated from humans in the community (98 and 65 isolates), broilers (126 and 122), and pigs (102 and 88) during 1998 were  tested for susceptibility to 12 different antimicrobial agents and for the presence of selected genes encoding resistance using pcr. furthermore, the presence of vancomycin resistant enterococci was examined in 38 human stool samples using selective enrichment. widespread resistance to chloramphenicol, macrolides, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline was found among isolates from all three sources. all e. faecium isolates from humans and pigs were susceptible to avilamycin, whereas 35% of isolates from broilers were resistant.  all e. faecium isolates from humans were susceptible to vancomycin, whereas 10% and 17% of isolates from broilers and pigs, respectively, were resistant. a vancomycin resistant e. faecium isolate was found in one of the 38 human fecal samples examined using selective enrichment. all vancomycin resistant isolates contained the vana gene, all chloramphenicol resistant isolates the cat(pip501) gene, and all five gentamicin resistant isolates the aac6-aph2 gene. sixty-one (85%) of 72 erythromycin resistant e. faecalis examined and 57 (90%) of 63 erythromycin resistant e. faecium isolates examined contained ermb. forty (91%) of the kanamycin resistant e. faecalis and 18 (72%) of the kanamycin resistant e. faecium isolates contained apha3. the tet(m) gene was found in 95% of the tetracycline resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates of human and animal origin, examined. tet(k) was not observed, whereas tet(l) was detected in 17% of  tetracycline resistant e. faecalis isolates and in 16% of the e. faecium isolates. tet(o) was not detected in any of the isolates from pigs, but was observed in 38% of e. faecalis isolates from broilers, in two e. faecalis isolates from humans and in three e. faecium isolates from broilers. tet(s) was not detected among isolates from animals, but was observed in 31% of e. faecalis  and one e. faecium isolate from humans. this study showed a frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of selected resistance genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium isolated from humans, broilers and pigs. differences in the occurrence of resistance and tetracycline resistance genes were observed among isolates from the different sources. however, similar resistance patterns and resistance genes were detected frequently indicating that transmission of resistant enterococci or resistance genes takes place between humans, broilers, and pigs.

TI  == comparison of a rabbit model of bacterial endocarditis and an in vitro infection  model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  == animal models are commonly used to determine the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial endocarditis. previously we have  utilized an in vitro infection model, which incorporates simulated endocardial vegetations (sevs) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of various antibiotics. in the present study, we compared four experimental rabbit endocarditis protocols to an in vitro infection model in an effort to determine if these models are comparable. we have evaluated the activity of clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in rabbit models against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. in vitro models were performed simulating the antibiotic pharmacokinetics obtained in the in vivo studies. models were dosed the same as rabbit models, and sevs were evaluated at the same time the rabbit vegetations were examined. clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin were evaluated against methicillin-susceptible (mssa1199) and -resistant (mrsa494) strains of s. aureus. ciprofloxacin was studied against mssa1199 and mssa487. sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin were evaluated against enterococcus faecium sf2149 and enterococcus faecalis wh245, respectively. we found that reductions in sev bacterial density obtained in the in vitro model were similar to those obtained in rabbit vegetations, indicating that the sev model may be a valuable tool for assessing antibiotic potential in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == a new rapid automated method for the detection of listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  == many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of listeria spp. spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges,  were automatically monitored by the biosys instrument in a semifluid layer (sfl). the blackening of sfl in modified mox broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. the instrument detected all nine strains of listeria monocytogenes tested. none of the gram negative organisms (proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, citrobacter and yersinia) were detected  by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including bacillus, streptococcus, and lactobacillus strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on palcam and oxford media and were also detected in the system. a total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. l. innocua was the dominant listeria species in these environmental samples. good correlation was obtained between numbers of listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 cfu/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 cfu/swab were detected in less than 22 h. the total assay time was 26 h.

TI  == genetic linkage of the vanb2 gene cluster to tn5382 in vancomycin-resistant enterococci and characterization of two novel insertion sequences.
AB  == vanb-type vancomycin resistance is encoded by the vanb gene cluster, which disseminates by horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). genetic linkage of the vanb gene cluster  to transposon tn5382 and the insertion sequences is16 and is256-like has previously been shown. in this study linkage of defined vanb gene cluster subtypes to these elements was examined. all the vanb2 subtype strains studied (n=14) revealed co-hybridization of vanb and tn5382, whereas the strains of vanb1 (n=8) and vanb3 (n=1) subtypes were tn5382 negative. conjugative cotransfer of the vanb2 gene cluster and tn5382 was demonstrated for two strains. dna sequencing of the vanx(b)-orfc region in vanb2 strains confirmed that the vanb2 gene cluster is an integral part of tn5382. no general pattern of linkage was observed with regard to is16 and is256-like. two novel insertion sequences were identified in specific vanb2 subtype strains. (i) a 1611 bp element (isenfa110) was detected in the left flank of tn5382. its insertion site, lack of terminal inverted and direct repeats, and two conserved motifs in its putative transposase all conform to the conventions of the is110 family. (ii) a 787 bp element (isenfa200) was detected in the vans(b)-vany(b) intergenic region. its orf encoded a putative protein with 60-70% identity to transposases of the is200 family. no further copies of isenfa110 were found by colony hybridization of 181  enterococcal isolates, whereas isenfa200 was found in four additional vanb2 strains from the usa. the five strains had identical isenfa200 element insertion  sites, and tn5382 was located downstream from a pbp5 gene conferring high-level ampicillin resistance. these isolates showed related pfge patterns, suggesting possible clonal spread of a vre strain harbouring a tn5382-vanb2-isenfa200 element linked to a pbp5 gene conferring ampicillin resistance.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of 100 enterococcus spp. strains isolated from patients hospitalized in state clinical hospital no 1  in warsaw. all strains were identified (api 20 strep) and their susceptibility to antibiotics was tested (atb strep) in automatic atb system. additionally, pyrase  activity, beta-lactamase production (in nitrocefin test), mics for vancomycin and teicoplanin (e test), hlar--high level aminoglycoside resistance and susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam (disc diffusion method) were determined. e. faecalis atcc 29212 was used as the control strain. fifty e. faecalis, 45 e. faecium, 2 e. casseliflavus, 2 e. durans and 1 e. avium strain were cultured. all strains were  pyrase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative. ten isolates demonstrated intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (6--e. faecalis and 4--e. faecium). one e. faecalis strain was intermediately susceptible to both glycopeptides. one e. casseliflavus strain showed low-level resistance to vancomycin, but this strain was susceptible to teicoplanin--phenotype van c. hlar strains were found among 31 e. faecalis and 40 e. faecium strains. 48 e. faecalis strains were susceptible to piperacillin and 49 to piperacillin/tazobactam. whereas, 41 e. faecium were resistant to both these drugs. thirty six per cent of isolates were resistant to  penicillin and ampicillin, 73% to erythromycin, 87% to tetracycline, 89% to lincomycin and 56% to nitrofurantoin. some discrepancies were noticed between the results of different methods applied for susceptibility testing--atb system, e test and disc diffusion. these discrepancies concerned hlar detection and susceptibility to glycopeptides determination. the best methods were: disc-diffusion for hlar detection and e test for determination of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents is observed in clinical enterococcus spp. isolates cultured in our laboratory, especially in e. faecium strains. it is necessary to control the dissemination of multiresistant enterococcus spp. strains in hospital wards.

TI  == [drug resistance of enterococcus species isolated from the urogenital system].
AB  == despite low virulence of enterococci, they have become important nosocomial pathogens. this has been correlated with the increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins. many strains of enterococci exhibit multiple drug resistance; the most important being high-level resistance (hlr) to penicillin (mic > 100 mg/l) and gentamicin (mic > 500 mg/l and 2000 mg/l) and/or  streptomycin (mic > 2000 mg/l). the investigation was performed on 92 strains, isolated from genito-urinary tract and recognised as enterococcus sp. all strains were obtained from several microbiological laboratories of gdansk, gdynia and tczew. on biochemical reaction profiles species of enterococci were identified as: e. faecalis (72.8%), e. faecalis varians (9.8%), e. durans (7.6%) and e. faecium (9.8%). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mics) of penicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, imipenem, gentamicin, amicacin, ciprofioxacin and vancomycin were determined by the agar dilution method. none of these 92 enterococcal strains was vancomycin resistant. 22.2% of e. faecium and 7.5% of e. faecalis showed high-level resistance to penicillin. none of these strains were produced beta-lactamase. high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin was detected. both--high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin--were found  in 6% e. faecalis; 11.1% e. faecalis varians and 22.2% e. faecium.

TI  == cpt-eia assays for the detection of vancomycin resistant vana and vanb genes in enterococci.
AB  == cycling probe technology (cpt) was combined with a colorimetric enzyme-immuno assay (eia) to develop two assays for the detection of vana and vanb genes in vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre). the cpt-eia assay employs a gene-specific fluorescein labeled dna-rna-dna probe that gets cleaved within the probe : target duplex. the cleaved dna probe fragments dissociate from the target, making it available for further cycling. following the separation of cleaved probe fragments, anti-fluorescein-horseradish peroxidase antibodies are used for the detection of uncleaved probes. the two cpt-eia assays were used to screen a collection of 440 clinical isolates (modrusan et al., 1999). all of the 154 vana  and 131 vanb isolates were correctly identified in the vana and vanb cpt-eia, respectively. the vana and vanb isolates were differentiated from vancomycin sensitive enterococci (vse) and also from the vanc isolates. in addition, an accurate vre detection in the cpt-eia assay was shown with cultures grown on eight different media.

TI  == activity of macrolides, lincosamines, streptogramins and fluoroquinolones against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci isolates from the western hemisphere: example of international surveillance (sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  )in the development of new drugs.
AB  == resistance among commonly isolated gram-positive cocci have compromised the available therapeutic regimens and require structured monitoring at the local, regional, national, and international levels. two popular treatment classes of antimicrobials (macrolides-lincosamines-streptogramins [mls], fluoroquinolones) have been tested against 3, 049 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the strains were  obtained from clinical cases in hospitals in the united states, canada, and six nations (10 medical centers )in latin america. mls and fluoroquinolone compounds  had moderate activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis only (gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin mic(50), 0.5 microg/ml), and quinupristin/dalfopristin was potent only against e.faecium isolates (mic(90), 1  microg/ml(-2) microg/ml). when tested against pneumococci, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90), < or = 1 microg/ml)were most active among the newer drugs, but vancomycin and clindamycinn inhibited > or =99.8% and 84.7% to 99.1% of strains, respectively. these results  from a global resistance monitoring program should encourage rapid drug development. based on in vitro sensitivity testing, they indicate a promising role for the treatment of emerging resistant gram-positive cocci. the clinical role for each new agent will depend on safety profiles, rates of administration,  and other issues identified during development in the clinical trials process.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from animals and food.
AB  == one hundred and one chicken products, boiled ham and turkey cold meat were acquired from 18 different supermarkets in spain during october 1997 to june 1998 and were analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). in the same way, 50 intestinal chicken samples from a slaughterhouse were also studied. vre were detected in 25 of 92 samples of food of chicken origin (27.2%), but no vre were found in cooked pork or turkey products. vre were also detected in 8 of 50 intestinal chicken samples from the slaughterhouse (16%). vre were identified as  enterococcus durans (n = 11), enterococcus faecalis (n = 10), enterococcus faecium (n = 10) and enterococcus hirae (n = 2). all these strains were characterized as belonging to the vana genotype by polymerase chain reaction. ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high level aminoglycoside resistance were frequently found among these strains. heterogeneity was observed in susceptibility patterns among vre strains, even in those of the same species. the high rate of colonization of chicken products by vana containing enterococci detected 6 months to 1 year after the banning of avoparcin as a growth promoter,  supports other studies suggesting that the food chain could be a source of vre colonization in humans and thus a source of vre infections.

AB  == stool specimens from 226 patients from intensive care units (n=69), general wards (n=112), and outpatient-clinics (n=45) at the innsbruck university hospital and from 433 healthy volunteers were inoculated on to enterococcosel agar supplemented with 5 microg/ml vancomycin and 4 microg/ml cefodizime. faecal specimens from 105 dairy cows, 171 pigs and 47 egg-laying hens were processed the same way. thirteen of 226 patients (5.8%) harboured 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) of the vana genotype; 12 e. faecium (from 11 patients) and two  e. faecalis (icu patients: 5.8%, general ward patients: 5.4%, outpatients: 6.7%). none of the faecal specimens from healthy volunteers or animals yielded vre. nine of the 13 patients harbouring vre had received antibiotic therapy during the previous four weeks (broad-spectrum cephalosporins: six patients; i.v. vancomycin: five patients). of the 14 vre (vana type) isolates six strains were indistinguishable by pfge using sma i as restriction endonuclease, six strains formed three pairs, and only two single isolates showed unique patterns. the results of our study supports the view that nosocomial cross transmission is currently the main cause of colonization and infection with vre in austria.

TI  == paradoxical effect of inserting, in enterococcus faecalis penicillin-binding protein 5, an amino acid box responsible for low affinity for penicillin in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins 5 (pbp5s) of enterococci are structurally and immunologically related proteins that are characterized by their low affinity for penicillin. for this reason, they are mainly involved in penicillin resistance, due essentially to their ability to take over the function of all other pbps already bound and inhibited by the beta-lactam. it has been demonstrated that penicillin resistance in enterococci is acquired either by overproduction of pbp5 or by the presence of specific amino acid sequences in the protein that further decrease the affinity for penicillin. in particular, a specific amino acid box (annga) previously identified in enterococcus faecium is responsible for the high penicillin resistance displayed by this species. here, we describe the insertion  of the pbp5 amino acid box annga in enterococcus faecalis, an enterococcal species usually more sensitive to penicillin, by site-directed mutagenesis. mutagenized pbp5 was re-introduced into a pbp5 mutant of e. faecalis obtained by  insertion of transposon tn916. data indicate that this amino acid box brings about no reduction in penicillin sensitivity in the recipient e. faecalis strain, but, paradoxically, dramatically lowers the penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration caused by the native pbp5. we deduce that, although enterococcal pbp5s are a family of closely related proteins as far as biological function is concerned, differences exist in their three-dimensional structure that affect penicillin affinity.

TI  == preliminary characterization of bacteriocins produced by enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolated from pig faeces.
AB  == a total of 92 enterococci, isolated from the faeces of minipigs subjected to an in vivo feeding trial, were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. bacteriocin production was confirmed for seven strains, of which four were identified as enterococcus faecalis and three as enterococcus faecium, on the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics. the bacteriocins produced by the ent. faecalis strains showed a narrow spectrum of activity, mainly against other enterococcus spp., compared with those from the ent. faecium strains showing a broader spectrum of activity, against indicator strains of enterococcus spp., listeria spp., clostridium spp. and propionibacterium spp. the bacteriocins of all seven enterococcus strains were inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, trypsin, pronase, pepsin and papain, but not by lipase, lysozyme and catalase. the bacteriocins were heat stable and displayed highest activity at neutral ph. the molecular weight of the bacteriocins, as determined by tricine sds-page, was approximately 3.4 kda. only the strains of ent. faecalis were found to contain plasmids. pcr detection revealed that the bacteriocins produced by ent. faecium bfe 1170 and bfe 1228 were similar to enterocin a, whereas those produced by ent. faecium bfe 1072 displayed homology with enterocin l50a and b.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens over  the last decade, but little is known about their epidemiology. we report on the prevalence of vre fecal colonization on the basis of a prospective study among patients hospitalized in a hematology intensive care unit and among nonhospitalized subjects living in the local community. a total of 243 rectal swabs from hematology patients and 169 stool samples from the control group were  inoculated onto bile-esculin agar plates with and without 6 mg of vancomycin per  liter and into an enrichment bile-esculin broth supplemented with 4 mg of vancomycin per liter. a total of 37% of the hospitalized patients and 11.8% of the subjects from the community were found to be vre carriers. a total of 65 vre  strains were isolated: 12 (18.5%) e. faecium, 46 (70.7%) e. gallinarum, and 7 (10.8%) e. casseliflavus strains. no e. faecalis strains were detected. all the e. faecium strains were of the vana genotype. molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a different pattern for each vana vre strain that originated from an individual subject. to our knowledge, this is the first study  to be carried out in a cattle-rearing region of france. it reports a higher vre prevalence than that reported in previous european or u.s. studies. a partial explanation is the use of an enrichment broth step which enabled detection of strains which would otherwise have been missed, but the fact that subjects and patients were recruited from a predominantly agricultural area where vancomycin-related antibiotics have recently been used in animal husbandry could  also contribute to the high levels of vre in patients and subjects alike.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

AB  == simple pcr and sequencing assays that utilize a single pair of degenerate primers were used to characterize a 438-bp-long dna fragment internal (soda(int)) to the  soda gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in 19 enterococcal type strains (enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus flavescens, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, enterococcus seriolicida, enterococcus solitarius,  and enterococcus sulfureus). sequence analysis of the soda(int) fragments enabled reliable identification of 18 enterococcal species, including e. casseliflavus-e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. the soda(int) fragments of e. casseliflavus and e.  flavescens were almost identical (99.5% sequence identity), which suggests that they should be associated in a single species. our results confirm that the soda  gene constitutes a more discriminative target sequence than 16s rrna gene in differentiating closely related bacterial species.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in taiwan: persistence of multiple species and multiple clones.
AB  == objectives: to describe the epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in a university hospital in taipei, taiwan. design: retrospective review over a 27-month period, from march 1996 to may 1998. setting: a tertiary-care teaching hospital in taiwan. participants: patients with vre isolated from any body site. methods: patients were identified through hospital microbiology and infection control records. patient charts were reviewed for clinical and epidemiology data, including age, gender, previous hospital admissions, underlying diseases, types of infection, and recent antibiotic use. vre isolates  were characterized by their typical biochemical reactions, cellular fatty acid profiles, and the presence of van genes. antibiotypes using the e-test and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) patterns of these isolates were used to determine the clonality. results: twenty-five isolates of vre recovered from 12 patients were identified. one patient with a perianal abscess had 12 isolates of  vre (4 enterococcus faecalis, 7 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus casseliflavus) recovered from perianal lesions. among 3 patients who were hospitalized in the same room, 1 had a community-acquired cellulitis over the left leg caused by e. faecalis, and the other 2 patients both had anal colonization with 2 isolates of e. faecalis. the other 8 patients had 1 e. faecalis isolate each from various clinical specimens. all isolates possessed vana resistance phenotype and vana genes. different antibiotypes and rapd patterns of the isolates from different patients excluded the possibility of nosocomial spread at the hospital. conclusions: multiple species of vre (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus) and multiple clones of e. faecium could colonize or infect hospitalized patients. in addition, clones of vre can persist long-term in patients' lower gastrointestinal tracts. these results extend our knowledge of the coexistence and the persistence of multiple species and multiple clones of vre in hospitalized patients.

TI  == prevalence and molecular epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci in belgian renal dialysis units.
AB  == the molecular epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) colonizing the intestinal tracts of belgian renal dialysis patients was studied among 1318 patients of a population of 1800 dialysis patients from 29 dialysis centers. of these, 185 patients (14.0%) were colonized with a vana-positive gre; gre harboring the vanb gene were not detected. the majority of the vana gre (80.5%) were identified as enterococcus faecium; 14.8% were identified as e. faecalis; and a limited number were identified as e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. dispar, e. durans, or e. gallinarum. genome analysis of 277 vana-positive gre by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high genetic variability both within  the different dialysis centers and within the patients' own gre flora. no high-level gentamicin-resistant vana-positive gre were detected, and most strains remained susceptible to ampicillin. these findings do not support a hospital-driven endemicity of vana-positive enterococcal isolates in belgium.

TI  == characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  == the recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. during a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a  variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (eva broth multiple tube test) used for public health purposes. the predominant species were enterococcus faecalis (39%)  and ent. faecium (29%), followed by ent. durans/hirae, ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. only one isolate was identified as belonging to the streptococcus genus. the authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. this may help  to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. all isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

AB  == the prevalence of rectal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in two high-risk populations--61 patients admitted to icu and 92 patients on renal dialysis--was studied longitudinally over a period of six months in a 650-bed general hospital. icu patients were swabbed weekly and dialysis patients monthly. enterococcal isolates were fully identified using the atb identification system,  and mics were determined according to the nccls recommendations. enterococci were isolated in 52 (83.6%) icu patients and 86 (93.4%) dialysis patients. vre were recovered at least once in 14 (27%) icu patients and four (4.8%) dialysis patients. all vre isolates (mic of vancomycin > or = 256 micrograms/ml) were resistant to teicoplanin (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml; vana phenotype), 87.5% were ampicillin-resistant, and 92% showed high-level resistance to gentamicin; 88% were e. faecium. the main risk factors for acquisition of vre included duration of hospitalization in the six months preceding entry into the study and  during the survey (p = 0.009 and 0.007 respectively, for icu patients), and duration of antibiotic administration (p = 0.005, for icu patients). the impact of vancomycin was most prominent (p = 0.005 for receipt and 0.06 for duration of  administration, in icu patients). six of the 18 vre carriers developed bacteraemia, six isolates being vancomycin-susceptible and one vancomycin-resistant (one patient had both). in this study, the first in israel,  a low rectal carriage rate occurred in renal dialysis patients and antibiotic use was the most important risk factor for vre colonization.

TI  == the role of recombination and mutation in 16s-23s rdna spacer rearrangements.
AB  == the intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16s-23s rdna) spacer  region (isr) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rrna operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): enterococcus faecalis (6) and e. faecium (6), bacillus subtilis (10), staphylococcus aureus (9), vibrio cholerae (4), haemophilus influenzae (6) and escherichia coli (7). it was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons  of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. when these variations were analysed using the program plato and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by dnaml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (z>3.3) spatial variation [region i was 78-184 nt long (2.1<z<49.4), region ii was 10-60  nt long (3.7<z<23)] and region iii was 6 nt long (3.4<z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. within region i, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained trna genes (trnaala, trnaile or trnaglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as vs2 (s. aureus) or rsl (e. coli)]. q analysis of the isr sequence from e. faecalis and e. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in dna sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn isrs from s. aureus showed that there was significant homology between vs2 and vs5/vs6. furthermore, repeat motifs with only a or t were present in higher copy numbers in vs5/vs6 than in vs2. since these sequence blocks (vs2 and vs5-vs6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in at expansion may have occurred between these two regions. a model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and at-expansion in intra-genomic isr variations. this process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial isr rearrangements.

AB  == background: the recent emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci limits the treatment of enterococcal infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of a new streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, against 30 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and compared with those of  other 15 antimicrobials. material and methods: enterococci were identified by using rapid id 32 strep system. genotyping of the isolates was performed by pcr.  the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin were determined by the agar dilution technique recommended by the nccls. susceptibilities to the rest of antibiotics tested (teicoplanin, ampicillin, penicillin, imipenem, doxycicline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, rifampin, levofloxacin, fleroxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, pefloxacin and clinafloxacin) were determined by using the e test. beta-lactamase production was examined with nitrocefin disks. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin has demonstrated excellent activity against enterococcus faecium (mic90' 2 micrograms/ml). enterococcus faecalis was considerably less susceptible than e. faecium, at concentration of 4 micrograms/ml inhibited only 31% of tested strains. for doxycicline 77% of strains were susceptible. only five isolates were susceptible to clinafloxacin; the other quinolones tested displayed poor activity. resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in 47% of isolates. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. conclusions: this study indicates that vancomycin-resistant enterococci are often concomitantly resistant to multiple antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin was the most active agent tested against e. faecium strains. on the basis of these results quinupristin/dalfopristin could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections.

AB  == enterococci are becoming major nosocomial pathogens, and increasing resistance to vancomycin has been well documented. conventional identification methods, which are based on culturing, require 2 to 3 days to provide results. pcr has provided  a means for the culture-independent detection of enterococci in a variety of clinical specimens and is capable of yielding results in just a few hours. however, all pcr-based assays developed so far are species specific only for clinically important enterococci. we have developed a pcr-based assay which allows the detection of enterococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes elongation factor ef-tu. initially, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tuf gene from several bacterial species (available in public databases) and designed degenerate pcr primers derived from conserved regions. these primers were used to amplify a target region of 803 bp from four enterococcal species (enterococcus avium, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum). subsequently, the complete nucleotide sequences of these amplicons were determined. the analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among enterococci but distinct from those of other bacteria. pcr primers complementary to these regions allowed amplification of genomic dnas  from 14 of 15 species of enterococci tested (e. solitarius dna could not be amplified). there was no amplification with a majority of 79 nonenterococcal bacterial species, except for 2 abiotrophia species and several listeria species. furthermore, this assay efficiently amplified all 159 clinical isolates of enterococci tested (61 e. faecium, 77 e. faecalis, 9 e. gallinarum, and 12 e. casseliflavus isolates). interestingly, the preliminary sequence comparison of the amplicons for four enterococcal species demonstrated that there were some sequence variations which may be used to generate species-specific internal probes. in conclusion, this rapid pcr-based assay is capable of detecting all clinically important enterococci and has potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == phenotypic distinction in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains  between susceptibility and resistance to growth-enhancing antibiotics.
AB  == susceptibility of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains from animals and foods to growth-promoting antibiotics used in animal feed was tested  by the agar dilution technique. acquired resistance to bacitracin, narasin, tylosin, and virginiamycin was seen for both species, and for e. faecium, resistance to avilamycin and avoparcin was also seen. drawing the distinction between susceptibility and resistance based on frequency distributions of mics was easy with avoparcin, avilamycin, and tylosin but difficult with virginiamycin and to some extent also with bacitracin and narasin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of enterococci causing infections in europe. the european vre study group.
AB  == in vitro susceptibilities of 4,208 enterococci (83% enterococcus faecalis isolates, 13.6% enterococcus faecium isolates, and 3.4% isolates of other species) from patients in 27 european countries towards 16 antibiotics were determined. high-level resistance to gentamicin varied by country (range, 1 to 49%; mean, 22.6% +/- 12. 3%) and per species (19.7% e. faecalis isolates, 13.6% e. faecium isolates, 3.4% by other species). vancomycin resistance was detected in 0.06% e. faecalis, 3.8% e. faecium, and 19.1% isolates of other species. all enterococci were susceptible to ly 333328 and everninomicin, and 25% of e. faecalis isolates and 85% of other enterococci were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the mic of moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin for ciprofloxacin-susceptible e. faecalis at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited was 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in icus in southeastern sweden. icu study group of the south east of sweden.
AB  == background: a study was designed to assess a computer-based program for continuous registration of antibiotic resistance, statistics concerning severity  of illness, and consumption of antibacterial drugs. methods: the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in eight icus in southeastern sweden was investigated yearly from 1995 through 1997. the antibiotic consumption in the icus was registered as defined daily doses (ddd) and compared to severity of illness (apache-ii scores). results: there was a statistically significant increase in ampicillin resistance among enterococcus spp. between 1996 and 1997,  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. a high prevalence of resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin (approximately 70%), ciprofloxacin (approximately 50%), fucidic acid (approximately 50%) and netilmicin (approximately 30%) was seen in all icus during the whole study period. there was a statistically significant increase in  ciprofloxacin resistance among escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. the resistance among enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime decreased but this change was not statistically significant. efforts were made to avoid betalactam antibiotics, except carbapenems, for treatment of infections caused by enterobacter spp. and the consumption of cephalosporins decreased whereas the consumption of carbapenems increased. the total antibiotic consumption decreased by 2.5% during  the study period. there was no correlation between apache ii scores and antibiotic consumption. conclusions: each icu within a hospital ought to have a program for "on-line" antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit so that changes in empirical treatment can be made when there is an increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates within that unit.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the surveillance network database--usa.
AB  == to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the united states. between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. when staphylococcal  isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/ml), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. we also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for  isolates of escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in united states hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  == nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. in this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). enterobacter, serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and  candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units.  in patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where escherichia coli was most common. methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of s. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. these data may allow clinicians to better  target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.

TI  == outcome of a screening program for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a hospital in victoria.
AB  == objective: to screen for faecal colonisation with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among potentially at-risk patients. design: infection control screening program. setting: monash medical centre (a tertiary care hospital), melbourne, victoria, in the seven months from june 1997. patients: patients in the renal, oncology and intensive care (icu) units. main outcome measures: presence of vre in a rectal swab or faecal specimen taken at admission and at regular intervals during inpatient stay; presence of vancomycin-resistance genes  (vana, vanb and vanc) assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr); genetic clonality of isolates assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: 574 patients (356 renal, 134 icu and 84 oncology) were screened; 12 were colonised with vre--nine renal inpatients, two having peritoneal dialysis or incentre haemodialysis, and one icu patient. nine isolates were enterococcus faecalis (seven positive for vanb and two negative for all three resistance genes) and three were enterococcus faecium (all positive for vanb). eight were high-level gentamicin resistant. pfge suggested genetic clonality between the index isolate and five other isolates from renal patients. no specific clinical practice was associated with vre colonisation. attempts to clear rectal carriage  with oral ampicillin/amoxycillin or bacitracin were of limited success. although  antibiotic prescribing in the renal unit was generally consistent with defined protocols, use of vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins has been further restricted. conclusions: renal inpatients in our institution appear most at risk  of vre colonisation (4.6% overall) and therefore of vre infection. routine screening, especially of potentially high-risk patients, should be considered in  major australian hospitals.

TI  == verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  == the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of  10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.)  inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its  exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple  cider sanitation and haccp programs.

TI  == prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 european university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme. amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in europe. the resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family enterobacteriaceae. of the staphylococcus aureus  isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in italy, portugal, spain, greece, france, the uk, and poland than in austria, belgium, germany, the netherlands, and switzerland. compared with the 1987-88 data of the european study group on antibiotic resistance, gentamicin resistance  has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. the reason for this observation is  unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.

TI  == role of transposon tn5482 in the epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in the pediatric oncology unit of a new york city hospital.
AB  == during a 36-month period between 1993 and 1995 in the pediatric oncology unit of  memorial sloan kettering cancer center, 74 patients experienced episodes of infection or colonization caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). characterization of the 74 bacterial isolates by microbiological and molecular techniques (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and hybridization with dna probes specific for the vana and vanb genes and for is1251) identified 73 enterococcusfaecium and one enterococcusfaecalis (vanb) among the primary vre isolates. most (69/73) of the e. faecium isolates carried vana and four isolates, the vanb gene complex. the overwhelming majority (67/69) of the vana -positive isolates also gave hybridization signal for is1251, indicating the presence of the newly described conjugative transposon tn5482. no hybridization with is1251 was obtained with the four vanb-carrying isolates. about 30% of the vana-positive strains (23/69) were represented by pfge subtype variants of a single clone, most isolates of which were recovered during a 4-month period between april to june of 1994. the larger portion of the vana-carrying vre represented by close to 70% of  the isolates (46/69) belonged to as many as 37 different clonal types, indicating tremendous genetic diversity. among 67 of the 69 vana-carrying isolates, the localization of the tn5482-associated vana gene complex could be unequivocally identified either on the chromosome (40/69) or in plasmids (27/69). transconjugants recovered from filter mating experiments using either a chromosomally located or plasmid-borne vana donor strain and a single vancomycin-susceptible strain of either e. faecium or e. faecalis were analyzed by molecular typing techniques. seven out of 10 independent transconjugants recovered from the same cross showed extensive differences in pfge pattern and also in the localization of the vana hybridizing dna fragment transferred from the common vre donor with chromosomally located vana. the observations suggest that the extensive genetic diversity observed among the clinical isolates of vre  may be generated during conjugation between vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcal isolates. the observations also suggest that the epidemic spread of  vre in the united states may be linked to the frequent presence of tn5482 among the american isolates.

TI  == interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  == handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, designated guc, and here redesignated as gucr, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. the vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the  vana cluster, to the chromosome of an e. faecalis recipient, jh2-2. here it is reported that an earlier isolate of e. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gucr lacks the vana gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by smai chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant gucr. therefore, "gucs" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vana cluster present in gucr. thirteen laboratory-generated vana transconjugants derived from  conjugation between gucr and jh2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. surprisingly, each jh2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. this pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (pfge) patterns largely consistent with that of  jh2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. however, pfge analysis showed that a large but variable amount of dna, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. the mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new dna is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, dna fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. sequencing of 16s ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rrna operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rdna operons was found. an apparent insertion sequence in e. faecium almost identical  to is 1485 and 57% sequence identity to is 199 of streptococcus mutans was found  in the region of dna transferred. the results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.

AB  == three of five natural plasmids carrying a wild-type vana gene cluster did not confer ly333328 glycopeptide resistance on enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 (mic = 2 microg/ml). the two remaining plasmids conferred resistance to the drug (mic, 8 microg/ml). the vanb gene cluster did not confer resistance to ly333328, since this antibiotic was not an inducer. mutations in the vans(b) sensor gene that allowed induction by teicoplanin or constitutive expression of the vanb cluster led to ly333328 resistance (mic, 8 to 16 microg/ml). overproduction of the vanh,  vana, and vanx proteins for d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-ala-d-lac) synthesis and d-ala-d-ala hydrolysis was sufficient for resistance to ly333328 (mic, 16 microg/ml). mutations in the host d-ala:d-ala ligase contributed to ly333328 resistance in certain vana- and vanb-type strains, but the mics of the antibiotic did not exceed 16 microg/ml. addition of d-2-hydroxybutyrate in the culture medium of mutants that did not produce the vanh d-lactate dehydrogenase led to incorporation of this d-2-hydroxy acid at the c-terminal ends of the peptidoglycan precursors and to ly333328 resistance (mic, 64 microg/ml). the vanz gene of the vana cluster conferred resistance to ly333328 (mic, 8 microg/ml) by an unknown mechanism. these data indicate that vana- and vanb-type enterococci may acquire moderate-level resistance to ly333328 (mic </= 16 microg/ml) in a single step by various mechanisms.

TI  == practical approach to the identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species.
AB  == enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with enterococcus faecalis and then enterococcus faecium predominating. because of the emergence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistance in enterococci, laboratories have been required to screen for resistant strains and to identify them to the species level. this has resulted in the need for accurate identification of species less commonly associated with clinical infections, such as enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, which are inherently resistant to the  glycopeptides. studies evaluating commonly used commercial identification systems, have found error rates for enterococcal species identification of 2-21%  for e. faecalis, 5-9% for e. faecium, and 14-79% for other species. reporting errors may have adverse effects on the management of clinical infections, as well as in the control of multidrug-resistant strain outbreaks. the purpose of this document is to present a simplified approach to the identification of enterococcus species that uses a combination of rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests.

AB  == this study aimed to ascertain the ability of the microbiology laboratory to detect and identify catalase-negative gram-positive cocci with particular reference to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). twenty-seven reference strains and 42 prospectively collected catalase-negative gram-positive cocci were screened by agar dilution breakpoint susceptibility and linked biochemical methods in routine use. ability to speciate organisms was then compared using: (i) a multiplex polymerase chain reaction, designed to detect gene sequences specific to enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and vancomycin resistance (van) genes; (ii) a commercial "api 20 strep" (iii) an algorithm using individual tests from a commercial api 20 strep strip; and (iv) the same algorithm utilising traditional phenotyping methods. all vancomycin resistant catalase-negative gram-positive cocci were detected by an agar dilution screening plate containing  4 micrograms/ml of vancomycin. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected all enterococci with van genes, speciated all vancomycin-sensitive e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates and excluded non-enterococcal vancomycin-resistant catalase-negative gram-positive cocci. algorithm-based methods speciated 41 of the 42 study isolates (98%). the api 20 strep correctly identified only 25 (60%)  of these organisms, 38 of which were vancomycin-sensitive e. faecalis. vre are detected by current screening methods for vancomycin-resistant catalase-negative  gram-positive cocci in this laboratory. api 20 strep, currently used to speciate  catalase-negative gram-positive cocci, is less reliable and should be replaced. algorithm-based phenotyping by either method tested is more reliable for speciation than api 20 strep in its recommended form. compared to the other methods tested, pcr is a rapid, accurate and inexpensive method of detecting and  speciating vancomycin-resistant enterococci and it provides important extra information impacting on clinical therapy and infection control.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the uk (ten teaching, ten associate teaching and ten district general hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between october 1996 and january 1997. high-level resistance (hlr) and low-level resistance (llr) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. however, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (llr range 0-15.4% and hlr  range 0-30.8%). considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for  staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. using conventional mic methodology, none of the isolates of s. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. however, eight isolates grew on brain heart infusion agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/l) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. with enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vana and three vanb phenotype).

TI  == plasmid heterogeneity and identification of a tn5281-like element in clinical isolates of high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated in the  uk.
AB  == ten clinical isolates of high-level gentamicin-resistant (hlgr) enterococcus faecium, collected from six hospitals throughout the uk, were studied to determine whether hlgr was attributed to widespread dissemination of a single plasmid or whether different plasmid types were implicated in the dissemination of this phenotype. hlgr was attributed to the presence of the aac6'-aph2" bifunctional aminoglycoside modifying enzyme. the aac6'-aph2" gene was present on a 70 kb plasmid in all ten isolates. conjugation studies indicated that the hlgr  marker could transfer with varying frequency, with or without the associated 70 kb plasmid. detailed molecular genetic analysis suggested that four of the isolates harboured a transposon similar to tn5281, originally identified in enterococcus faecalis strain hh22 isolated in the usa. the uk transposon, however, lacked the two symmetrically located haeiii sites found in tn5281. the six remaining isolates appeared to have a tn5281-truncated structure in which the aac6'-aph2" gene is flanked by an is256 element at the 5' end. further studies with nine restriction endonucleases showed that the aac6'-aph2" gene was associated with two different plasmid types in e. faecium. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis identified three different patterns. the four e.  faecium isolates harbouring the tn5281-like structure were indistinguishable from each other, while the remaining six isolates exhibited two distinct pfge patterns. this is the first study to indicate that there is heterogeneity among the plasmids that confer the hlgr phenotype in e. faecium isolates in the uk and  to report on the presence of a transposon, similar to tn5281, in e. faecium harbouring the aac6'-aph2" gene.

TI  == identification of enterococci by ribotyping with horseradish-peroxidase-labelled  16s rdna probes.
AB  == enterococci are frequently associated with hospital-acquired infection. identification of enterococci using conventional biochemical tests are often tedious to perform in a routine diagnostic laboratory and may give equivocal results. this study evaluates the usefulness of ribotyping by dna hybridisation to identify 68 members of the bacterial genus enterococcus characterised by a conventional test scheme. dna probes (830 bp in size) were derived from the 16s rrna gene of e. coli or e. faecalis by pcr, labelled with horseradish peroxidase  and used in southern blot hybridisations of enterococcal dna digested with ecori. unique ribotypes were obtained for 11 different species using 12 enterococcus type strains. ribotyping identified 44 e. faecalis isolates, 19 e. faecium isolates, two e. durans isolates and one e. avium isolate in concordance with results of the biochemistry tests. two isolates that had ribotype patterns identical to the e. faecium type strain were unable to be definitively identified by biochemical tests. the results show that ribotyping is able to differentiate between e. faecium and e. faecalis and may be useful for identifying other enterococci in the hospital setting. in addition, ribotyping using dna probes and enhanced chemiluminescence is a safe and more reproducible alternative to radiolabelling rna in a clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == proficiency of clinical laboratories in spain in detecting vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. the spanish vre study group.
AB  == studies in a variety of u.s. clinical laboratories have demonstrated difficulty in detecting intermediate and low-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the misclassification of "at least intermediate resistant isolates" as vancomycin susceptible may have both clinical implications and a negative impact on measures to control the spread of vre. no published study has assessed the ability of clinical laboratories in europe to detect vre. so, the apparent low prevalence of vre in european hospitals may be, in part, secondary to the inability of these laboratories to detect all vre. in an effort to assess european laboratories' proficiency in detecting vre, we identified 22 laboratories in spain and asked them to test four vre strains and one susceptible enterococcal strain from the centers for disease control and prevention collection. each organism was tested by the routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method used by each laboratory. overall, vre were correctly identified in 61 of 88 (69.1%) instances. the accuracy of vre detection varied with the level of resistance and the antimicrobial susceptibility method. the high-level-resistant strain (enterococcus faecium; mic, 512 microg/ml) was accurately detected in 20 of 22 (91. 3%) instances, whereas the intermediate-resistant isolate (enterococcus gallinarum; mic, 8 microg/ml) was accurately detected in only 11 of 22 (50%) instances. classification errors occurred in 27 of 88 (30.9%) instances. misclassification as vancomycin susceptible was the most common error (16 of 27 [59.3%] instances). our study shows that the participating spanish laboratories had an overall acceptable proficiency in detecting vre but that a substantial proportion of vre isolates with low or intermediate levels of resistance were not detected. we recommend that studies be conducted to validate laboratory proficiency testing as an important step in the prevention and control of the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase of pyrococcus furiosus is enzymologically and  structurally a carbamate kinase.
AB  == the hyperthermophiles pyrococcus furiosus and pyrococcus abyssi make pyrimidines  and arginine from carbamoyl phosphate (cp) synthesized by an enzyme that differs  from other carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases and that resembles carbamate kinase (ck) in polypeptide mass, amino acid sequence, and oligomeric organization. this  enzyme was reported to use ammonia, bicarbonate, and two atp molecules as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases to make cp and to exhibit bicarbonatedependent atpase activity. we have reexamined these findings using the enzyme of p. furiosus expressed in escherichia coli from the corresponding gene cloned in a plasmid. we show that the enzyme uses chemically made carbamate rather than ammonia and bicarbonate and catalyzes a reaction with the stoichiometry and equilibrium that are typical for ck. furthermore, the enzyme catalyzes actively full reversion of the ck reaction and exhibits little bicarbonate-dependent atpase. in addition, it cross-reacts with antibodies raised against ck from enterococcus faecium, and its three-dimensional structure, judged by x-ray crystallography of enzyme crystals, is very similar to that of ck. thus, the enzyme is, in all respects other than its function in vivo, a ck. because in other organisms the function of ck is to make atp from adp and cp derived from arginine catabolism, this is the first example of using ck for making rather than using cp. the reasons for this use and the adaptation of the enzyme to this new function are discussed.

TI  == [evolution of resistance in the genus enterococcus in strains isolated from blood].
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the evolution of the species distribution and the prevalence of resistance to the enterococcus genus. we studied 281 strains of enterococcus isolated from blood samples: 90 throughout 1984 and 791 from the years 1994 to 1996. identification was made using poscombo  4y microscan-baxter dehydrated panels and the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux). the mics were calculated using the agar dilution method according to recommendations of the nccls for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin. the production of betalactamases were evaluated using a paper disk with nitrocefin for all the strains. the genotypes with resistance to glycopeptides were determined using pcr. the percentage of e. faecalis for 1984-1986/1994-1996 was 82.2/79.4; of e. faecium 4.4/16.4; and other species 12.214.3. the resistance to ampicillin went from 1.1% to 5.8%; high level resistance to glycopeptides went from 0% to 9.9%; for low level from 7.7% to 2.6%; resistance to a high charge of gentamicin went from 27.7% to 40.8%; and that for kanamycin from 45.5% to 62.8%. resistance to streptomycin remained constant (45.5%). no strains produced betalactamases. for the species e. faecium, a statistically significant increase was detected for global resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and kanamycin, with resistance to streptomycin remaining at similar percentages. no high level resistance to glycopeptides was detected in the first time period, but the low level resistance was greater.

TI  == atypical genetic locus associated with constitutive production of enterocin b by  enterococcus faecium bfe 900.
AB  == a purified bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium bfe 900 isolated from black olives was shown by edman degradation and mass spectrometric analyses to be identical to enterocin b produced by e. faecium t136 from meat (p. casaus, t. nilsen, l. m. cintas, i. f. nes, p. e. hernandez, and h. holo, microbiology 143:2287-2294, 1997). the structural gene was located on a 2.2-kb hindiii fragment and a 12.0-kb ecori chromosomal fragment. the genetic characteristics and production of entb by e. faecium bfe 900 differed from that described so far  by the presence of a conserved sequence like a regulatory box upstream of the entb gene, and its production was constitutive and not regulated. the 2.2-kb chromosomal fragment contained the hitherto undetected immunity gene for entb in  an atypical orientation that is the reverse of that of the structural gene. typical transport and other genes associated with bacteriocin production were not detected on the 12.0-kb chromosomal fragment containing the entb structural gene. this makes the entb genetic system different from most other bacteriocin systems, where transport and possible regulatory genes are clustered. entb was subcloned and expressed by the dedicated secretion machinery of carnobacterium piscicola lv17a. the structural gene was amplified by pcr, fused to the divergicin a signal peptide, and expressed by the general secretory pathway in enterococcus faecalis  atcc 19433.

TI  == comparison of direct plating and broth enrichment culture for the detection of intestinal colonization by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci among hospitalized  patients.
AB  == the results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in  the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. in most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. in this  cross-sectional study on the carrier state of gre among patients at the university hospital antwerp, antwerp, belgium, performed on 21 may 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on enterococcosel agar (biomerieux) and after enrichment in enterococcosel broth. the prevalence of gre  was 12.8%. direct plating recovered 53.4% of the gre isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) cfu per g of feces. the prevalence of gre among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. the gre species isolated included 19 e. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 e. faecium (30.2%), 6 e. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 e. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains isolated carried the vana gene, and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus carried the vanc1 and vanc2 gene, respectively. the majority of isolates were polyclonal. our data  indicate that the rate of detection of gre from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.

TI  == reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci.
AB  == in this work we have developed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) methods for detecting specific mrna from enterococci, particularly vana  and vanb genes, responsible for glycopeptide resistance in this genus. mrna from  the two genes was detected immediately after rna extraction of a midlog phase culture, determined by growth rate analysis. because of the short half-life associated with many bacterial rna species (1.5-2 min), time is an important factor in obtaining rna of good yield and high purity. our results showed that: (i) the transcription of mrna related to vana ligase in enterococci showing van a phenotype happens only after induction with both vancomycin and teicoplanin; (ii) the transcription of mrna related to vanb ligase happens only in the presence of  vancomycin and (iii) there was no transcription of mrna in the two strains positive to vana gene after pcr experiments. rt-pcr methodology can have numerous applications in microbiology for studying gene expression in isolated bacteria and also in nonculturable cells in environmental samples, for studies of mechanisms and/or as an indicator of viability in bacterial communities.

TI  == characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
AB  == enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the  product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components  of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene  also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in  the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the clinical effect of a common nosocomial pathogen.
AB  == enterococcus spp. is now the third most common pathogen among hospitalized patients, accounting for nearly 12% of nosocomial infections. enterococcus faecalis is the most prevalent enterococcal species (85%-89%), whereas enterococcus faecium accounts for 10%-15% of enterococcal isolates. only 5% of e. faecalis isolates are resistant to glycopeptides. e. faecium has also been shown  to be resistant to nonglycopeptide compounds, such as penicillins (97%), high-level gentamicin (52.1%), and high-level streptomycin (58.3%). numerous risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have been identified, including as length of hospital- or icu-stay, proximity to a hospitalized, colonized vre, patient severity of illness, renal failure, recent surgery, immunosuppression, and organ recipient status. an important risk factor is prior  exposure to antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole, as well as the number and duration of recent antibiotics. interventions to reduce nosocomial vre cross-transmission have also been studied. using gowns in addition to gloves diminished the incidence of vre in one study, but had a negligible effect in a second study. studies have shown that in many cases (> 60%) vancomycin usage is inappropriate. while controlling the use of vancomycin alone has only variably diminished vre colonization, other efforts such as narrowing the spectrum of antibiotics, antiseptics, and reducing immunosuppression may be salutary. attempts to eradicate vre intestinal carriage  with enteral agents (bacitracin, tetracycline + rifampin, novobiocin) have been reported but seem to have only a transient effect. non-antimicrobial interventions such as removal of intravenous or bladder catheters and/or surgical or percutaneous drainage may be beneficial. in addition, the development of new antimicrobial agents such as streptogramins, glycopeptides, everninomicins, and oxazalididones will hopefully play an important role in reducing morbidity from these pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in taiwan.
AB  == to understand the antimicrobial resistance patterns of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in taiwan, we tested the in vitro activities of 10 antimicrobial agents against 71 clinical isolates (39 of enterococcus faecalis and 32 of enterococcus faecium) by means of the agar dilution method. resistance was determined on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each antimicrobial agent--mic50 and mic90 (minimum concentrations required to inhibit  growth of 50% and 90% of isolates, respectively) were determined. no beta-lactamase producers were identified with the cefinase test. all e. faecalis  isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, and 97% of these isolates were resistant to teicoplanin (vana phenotype). of the e. faecium isolates, 75% were susceptible to teicoplanin (vanb phenotype) and most were resistant to penicillin (94%) and ampicillin (94%). quinupristin/dalfopristin was markedly less active against e. faecalis than e. faecium isolates (mic50, 64 vs 2 micrograms/ml; mic90, 128 vs 8 micrograms/ml; susceptibility rates, 3% vs 81%). five of the eight vana phenotype e. faecium isolates and one of the 24 vanb phenotype e. faecium isolates were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the activity of rifampin was also species-specific, with e. faecium being markedly less susceptible to this agent than e. faecalis (mic50, 16 vs 1 microgram/ml; mic90, 64 vs 4 micrograms/ml). our data suggest the potential of teicoplanin and  quinupristin/dalfopristin as appropriate antimicrobial agents in the treatment of infections caused by vanb phenotype e. faecium. penicillin, ampicillin, and rifampin alone, or preferably in combination with other agents, appear to be the  most appropriate agents for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis infections in taiwan.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin and rpr 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic gram-positive organisms including enterococcus faecium. however, most isolates of enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. against staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or rpr 106972 was more active. rpr 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin mics for isolates of h. influenzae (1-8 mg/l) clustered around the breakpoint. there were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in mics or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: mueller-hinton (mha), iso-sensitest (isa), and diagnostic sensitivity test (dst) agars. the addition of blood to the medium increased mics 2- to 4-fold, with mha showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on isa.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin a, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against  719 recent clinical gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type  cultures. hmr 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with mic90s of < or =0.5 mg/l, except for staphylococcus epidermidis (mic90 > 128 mg/l), haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 1 mg/l) and the anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 2 mg/l) and clostridium difficile (mic90 = 1 mg/l). in general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the mics of hmr 3647. additionally, the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647 was not affected by the presence  of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. the antichlamydial activity of hmr 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.

TI  == isolation and chemical characterization of a capsular polysaccharide antigen shared by clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococci are a common cause of serious infections, especially in newborns, severely immunocompromised patients, and patients requiring intensive care. to characterize enterococcal surface antigens that are targets of opsonic antibodies, rabbits were immunized with various gentamicin-killed enterococcus faecalis strains, and immune sera were tested in an opsonophagocytic assay against a selection of clinical isolates. serum raised against one strain killed  the homologous strain (12030) at a dilution of 1:5,120 and mediated opsonic killing of 33% of all strains tested. in addition, this serum killed two (28%) of seven vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. adsorption of sera with  the homologous strain eliminated killing activity. the adsorbing antigens were resistant to treatment with proteinase k and to boiling for 1 h, but were susceptible to treatment with sodium periodate, indicating that the antigen inducing opsonic activity is a polysaccharide. antibodies in immune rabbit sera reacted with a capsule-like structure visualized by electron microscopy both on the homologous e. faecalis strain and on a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strain. the capsular polysaccharides from e. faecalis 12030 and e. faecium 838970 were purified, and chemical and structural analyses indicated they were identical glycerol teichoic acid-like molecules with a carbohydrate backbone structure of 6-alpha-d-glucose-1-2 glycerol-3-po4 with substitution on carbon 2 of the glucose with an alpha-2-1-d-glucose residue. the purified antigen adsorbed opsonic killing activity from immune rabbit sera and elicited high titers of antibodies (when used to immunize rabbits) that both mediated opsonic killing of bacteria and bound to a capsule-like structure visualized by electron microscopy. these results indicate that approximately one-third of a sample of 15 e. faecalis strains and 7 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains possess shared capsular polysaccharides that are targets of opsonophagocytic antibodies and therefore are potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == prevalence of high level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci in turkey.
AB  == enterococcus spp. have become the third most common cause of nosocomial infections. high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar), an important clinical concern, has been associated with some species of enterococci. the synergistic effect obtained by the combination of aminoglycosides with penicillin or vancomycin disappears in strains that show high-level resistance (hlr) to the aminoglycosides. we evaluated the agar dilution and high content disk diffusion tests for the detection of hlar for 60 isolated enterococci. in our study 4 strains of enterococcus faecalis (6.6%) and 8 strains of enterococcus faecium (13.3%), totally 20% were found to be highly resistant to gentamicin; 2 strains of e. faecalis (13.3%), 8 strains of e. faecium (3.3%), totally 16.6% showed hlr  to streptomycin by agar dilution method and the same rates were found by high-content disk diffusion method. 2 strains of e. faecalis (3.3%), 4 strains of e. faecium (6.6%), totally 10% showed vancomycin resistance by agar dilution method. the ratio for beta lactamase activity was found to be 26.6% for e. faecalis and 3.3% for e. faecium. our results demonstrate that high-content disk  diffusion test should be performed by using both gentamicin and streptomycin in routine screening of hlar among enterococci and the determination of beta lactamase activity at the same time is also useful for detecting resistance to a  beta lactam agent.

AB  == during a 2-year period, 10 portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. of more than 12,000 staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main  patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only  to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials  tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 71% of s. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested)  and 84% s. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. most of the 5,000 enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 e. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. a high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both enterococcus species. this survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in e. faecium. the high prevalence of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and in the cns remains an issue of medical concern.

TI  == evaluation of the oxolinic acid--esculin--azide medium for the isolation and enumeration of faecal streptococci in a routine monitoring programme for bathing  waters.
AB  == m-enterococcus agar (m-ent) has been generally considered the reference medium for faecal streptococci in bathing waters. however, it shows several shortcomings, and therefore it is important to test newly developed media that can guarantee more precise results. in this sense, the recently described oxolinic acid--esculin--azide agar medium (oaa) and m-enterococcus agar (m-ent) were comparatively evaluated for the detection of faecal streptococci from seawater and fresh water. the oaa medium showed a significantly higher relative recovery percentage and specificity for both types of water than m-ent. a similar spectrum of species was recorded from both media, enterococcus faecium being predominant in fresh water and enterococcus faecalis, in seawater. the superior performance of the oaa medium in both types of bathing waters, added to the fact  that it does not require the use of complementary confirmative tests, makes this  medium an excellent candidate to be employed for monitoring programmes.

AB  == background: interaction of enterococcus spp. and host defense mechanisms is not well known. opsonic requirements of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to be phagocyted by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) were evaluated. methods: twenty strains (10 e. faecalis and 10 e. faecium) were studied. phagocytosis was determined by a radiometric assay. bacterial cells were labelled with 3h-adenine and opsonized with: a) 10% of human pool sera (hps); b)  10% of decomplemented hps, and c) albumin and fibronectin. results: phagocytosis  of enterococcus spp. by pmn in the presence of hps was significantly higher than  that in the absence of opsonins. the phagocytosis of e. faecium was higher than that of e. faecalis. a strain-dependent effect of complement in the phagocytosis  of enterococcus spp. was observed. neither albumin nor fibronectin showed an opsonic activity on enterococcus spp. conclusions: a great heterogeneity in the opsonic requirements of enterococcus spp. was observed. serum opsonins show a critical role in the phagocytosis of e. faecalis and e. faecium by pmn, this effect being more relevant with e. faecium. a strain-dependent opsonic activity of complement was observed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in north and south america.
AB  == gatifloxacin (formerly am-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. to assess this  new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/ml) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. the strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in north (38 hospitals) and south (10 hospitals) america. against enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. among staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at <  or = 4 micrograms/ml) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci  especially s. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. the glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin  and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/ml) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the americas.

TI  == heterogeneity of resistance elements in clinical isolates of enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance.
AB  == high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic > 1,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin (hlgr) in enterococci is common in taiwan. in this study, we investigated the distribution of gentamicin resistance elements in enterococci isolated at national taiwan university hospital in a 1-year period, and also examined the transfer and the genetic variability of the resistance elements of different isolates. among 109 isolates tested, 43 (39%) hlgr isolates were identified. hlgr was most common in enterococcus faecium isolates (7/15, 47%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (34/80, 43%), enterococcus avium (1/5, 20%), and enterococcus casseliflavus (1/9, 11%). to understand the mechanism of resistance transfer, four isolates of e. faecalis and five isolates of e. faecium showing hlgr were studied. transfer of resistance markers to a plasmid-free recipient strain of e. faecalis jh2-7 was observed, with transfer frequencies ranging from 10(-2) to 10(-8). all of the transconjugants contained plasmids, with sizes ranging from 45 kb to larger than 70 kb. at least three plasmid patterns were observed on digestion with haeiii. hybridization with a probe specific for the aac6'aph2" gentamicin resistance gene confirmed that all of these hlgr isolates carried a gm(r) determinant, though the hybridization patterns of the plasmids from e. faecalis and e. faecium were different. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gm(r) determinants, the results suggest heterogeneity may occur in the flanking regions of resistance elements.

AB  == objective: to review experience with enterococcal bacteremia before the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus at a tertiary care teaching hospital. design: retrospective chart review of episodes of enterococcal bacteremia identified through the clinical microbiology laboratory from january 1990 to december 1994. antimicrobial susceptibilities were performed for all isolates and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for genetic typing of selected strains. results: one hundred and twenty-six episodes of bacteremia were identified in 109 patients: 108 enterococcus faecalis, 13 enterococcus faecium, four both e faecalis and e faecium, and one enterococcus durans. enterococcal isolates occurred with polymicrobial bacteremia in 62 (49%) episodes. the most common sites of infection were central venous catheters (45%) and the urinary tract (21%). enterococcal bacteremia was usually nosocomially acquired (88%), and associated with older age, instrumentation, and prior or current antimicrobial therapy. overall mortality was 22%, and 7.2% was partially or fully attributable  to enterococcal bacteremia. resistance to ampicillin, high level gentamicin and high level streptomycin were 0%, 32% and 31% for e faecalis, respectively, and 44%, 0% and 47% for e faecium, respectively. conclusions: during this review, the frequency and impact of enterococcal bacteremia at this institution was relatively limited. isolates resistant to ampicillin and aminoglycosides were emerging, but differences in patient outcomes were similar for resistant and susceptible isolates.

AB  == we report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of enterococcus faecalis. studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, esp, reveal a significant (p < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived e. faecalis isolates. interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical e. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. analysis of the structural gene among various e. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the esp protein. the deduced primary structure of the esp protein from strain mmh594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kda, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. esp bears global organizational similarity to the rib and c alpha proteins of group b streptococci. identity among esp, rib, and c alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. the high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait  among infection-derived e. faecalis and group b streptococcal isolates.

TI  == interactions of vancomycin resistant enterococci with biomaterial surfaces.
AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections and are often found adherent to indwelling catheters. concern about such device associated infections has increased with the appearance of vancomycin resistant (vr) enterococci. however, the possible influence of vancomycin resistance in the pathogenesis of biomaterial centered infection has not yet been assessed. using polyethylene terephthalate (pet) disks as model surfaces, the authors evaluated possible differences in the adherence and persistence of vancomycin sensitive (vs) and vr  strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis on biomaterial surfaces in vitro and in vivo. the results indicate that: 1) as expected, the clearance of free vr and vs organisms after intraperitoneal injection into normal mice is equally efficient. 2) in vitro, vr bacteria are roughly twice as adherent to plasma coated pet surfaces as are vs organisms. 3) however, in vivo persistence of vs organisms preadherent to biomaterial implants is 5- to 10-fold better than  that of preadherent vr organisms. the authors now believe that a discrete change  in bacterial cell wall composition between vr and vs enterococci may contribute to the substantial differences in bacterial adhesion and survival of adherent organisms.

AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of 446 enterococcus isolates from 9 medical centres of  moscow and st. petersburg was tested. among the isolates 386 belonged to e.faecalis, 48 to e.faecium and 12 to the other species. all the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. as for e.faecalis 84 and 85 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam respectively (no production of beta-lactamases), the frequency of high resistance to aminoglycosides amounted to 44 per cent with respect to streptomycin and to 25 per cent with respect to gentamicin, 75 per cent of the isolates was susceptible  to ciprofloxacin. as for e.faecium and the rare species of enterococcus more than 70 per cent of the isolates was resistant to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam, the frequency of high resistance to aminoglycosides exceeded 60 per cent, 17 and  25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == incidence of antibiotic resistance in blood and urine isolates from hospitalized  patients. report from a european collaborative study. european study group on antibiotic resistance (esgar).
AB  == during 1992-93, 2544 isolates from blood cultures, comprising 52% gram-negative bacilli, 24% staphylococcus aureus, 15% other staphylococci, 7% enterococcus faecalis and 2% e. faecium, were consecutively collected and identified in 30 laboratories in 21 european countries. in addition 2512 urine isolates, comprising 82% gram-negative bacilli, 3% s. aureus, 4% other staphylococci and 11% enterococci were collected. the bacteria were sent to 3 laboratories for susceptibility testing by the microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth. the mics of penicillins and aztreonam for all susceptible gram-negative bacilli were  0.25-8 mg/l, penems 0.032-2 mg/l, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefpirome or cefepime 0.032-0.25 mg/l, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin 0.125-2 mg/l, amikacin 0.5-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.016-1 mg/l, trimethoprim 0.25-1 mg/l and tetracycline 1-2 mg/l. for susceptible staphylococci the mics of erythromycin were 0.25-0.5 mg/l, clindamycin 0.125-0.25 mg/l, methicillin 2-8 mg/l, vancomycin and trimethoprim 1-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.25-1 mg/l, gentamicin and tobramycin 0.25-1 mg/l. for the enterococci the mics of ampicillin and vancomycin were 2-4 mg/l and of imipenem, teicoplanin and trimethoprim 0.5-1 mg/l. the antibiotic resistance rates varied between laboratories, being lower in northern europe, except for the penems, cefpirome and cefepime, which showed uniformly lower resistance rates. compared to the earlier european studies the resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics among the gram-negatives have not changed except with  an increase to cefotaxime and ceftazidime in central europe. resistance to aminoglycosides had also increased in central europe from 7-8% to 20-21%, but decreased in southern europe from 22-24% to 13-14% among the blood isolates and from 12-28% to 6-7% among the urine isolates. there was an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in staphylococci from southern europe. the prevalence of mrsa was significant in central and southern europe. it is of importance that collaborative national and international studies on the incidence of antibiotic resistance are being performed on a repetitive basis.

TI  == alternate antimicrobial therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococci burn wound infections.
AB  == survival after a major thermal burn is precarious and fraught with difficult complications associated with hypermetabolism, gut or respiratory dysfunction, and infection. clinicians must be cognizant of a new threat to the patient with burn injuries--the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). in an analysis of 31 clinical isolates obtained during acute burn hospitalization, an optimal antimicrobial therapy for vre has been identified. all vre cultures were  inoculated to the microscan gram-positive breakpoint combo panel #8 (dade microscan, inc, sacramento, calif), which speciates the enterococci, provides antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (including vancomycin) and a biotype, and examines streptomycin and gentamicin synergy. eleven (35.5%) of the 31 isolates were identified as e faecium and 20 (64.5%) as e faecalis. all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol and tetracycline, whereas only half were sensitive to gentamicin synergy screen. all other antimicrobials screened against vre were  either ineffective or of limited effect. our preliminary data supports the initiation of chloramphenicol therapy when a vre burn wound infection is encountered or suspected.

AB  == today, when the number of high-risk patients is increasing, special attention should be paid to polyresistant gram-positive microorganisms staphylococci and enterococci, whose role in infective complications and septic states is increasing. the author analyzes published reports on the rate of isolation of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mrs) and enterococci in different countries  and relationship of this parameter with antibiotic policy. special attention is paid to unjustified wide use of third-generation cephalosporines and their role in selection of polyresistant bacteria. the rate of mrs isolation vs. all other staphylococci at intensive care wards for newborns is as high as 63.9%. the incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (most often s. epidermidis) in clinical material (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine) from high-risk patients increased 2-3 times during two recent years. glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanine are drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by such microorganisms (sepsis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, etc.). these drugs should be listed among obligatory antibiotics for resuscitation and intensive care wards as life-saving drugs.

AB  == in the european glycopeptide susceptibility survey 7078 gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of western europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. teicoplanin (mode mic 0.5 microgram/ml) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (mic < or = 4 micrograms/ml) and all  but four to teicoplanin (mic < or = 8 micrograms/ml); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml). with coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of mic of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/ml teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/ml (resistant). among isolates of s. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml) and 3.3% were resistant (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to teicoplanin. however, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. generally, teicoplanin (mode mic < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode mic  < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. glycopeptide-susceptible enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode mic 0.25 microgram/ml) than to vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml). combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (vana phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of enterococcus faecium than in enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. four isolates of e.  faecium and four of e. faecalis expressed the vanb-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. spain was the only country not to submit resistant e. faecium strains while resistant e. faecalis isolates came only from spain and italy.

TI  == in vivo testing of an enterococcus faecalis efaa mutant and use of efaa homologs  for species identification.
AB  == disruption of the previously described efaa (from enterococcus faecalis antigen a) gene was generated in e. faecalis strain og1rf and loss of an 37-kda immunoreactive band from the mutant was demonstrated in western blots. in a mouse peritonitis model, mice infected with the efaafs (fs=from enterococcus faecalis)  mutant showed more prolonged survival than mice infected with the parent strain og1rf. these results suggest that efaafs encodes a function important for infection of mice by enterococci. an efaa-like gene was also identified in e. faecium dna libraries and its deduced amino acid sequence showed 73% similarity to efaa of e. faecalis and 42-63% similarities to a group of streptococcal virulence and adhesion associated proteins that are components of atp-binding cassette transport systems. intragenic probes representing efaafs, recafs, efaafm (fm=from e. faecium) and gyrafm were tested for their ability to identify e. faecalis and e. faecium using colony lysates of 133 enterococci and one streptococcus sp. probes of e. faecium and e. faecalis origin hybridized to all isolates of e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively, regardless of their clinical source but not to any of 29 other enterococci. these results suggest that the use of gene probes may prove helpful in identification of isolates of e. faecium and e. faecalis.

TI  == conditional adherence of enterococcus faecalis to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == the adherence of 44 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, a common cause of endocarditis, and 13 enterococcus faecium to substrates of six extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins was examined using 35s-labeled bacteria. one e. faecalis strain, isolated from a patient with endocarditis, adhered to collagen types i and iv and another e. faecalis strain adhered to laminin and to collagen types i  and iv. however, most isolates showed little adherence ( < 5% of added cells adhered) when grown at 37 degrees c regardless of their source (endocarditis, urine or fecal sample). when grown at 46 degrees c (but not when grown in co2 or  nutrient limited media), most isolates of e. faecalis increased their adherence to immobilized laminin, collagen types i and iv but not to fibronectin, fibrinogen or bovine serum albumin, whereas none of the e. faecium increased adherence when grown at 46 degrees c or 50 degrees c. the adherence of e. faecalis was eliminated by digestion with trypsin, suggesting that a protein is somehow important, directly or indirectly, for adherence to occur. pre-incubation of bacteria with soluble collagen types i and iv inhibited the adherence to these ecm proteins. these results demonstrate that in e. faecalis, adherence to ecm proteins is produced during routine in vitro growth conditions by occasional isolates and can be produced during certain stressful growth conditions by others. whether this adherence relates to the propensity of e. faecalis to cause  endocarditis remains to be determined.

TI  == in vivo characterization of the type a and b vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) vanrs two-component systems in escherichia coli: a nonpathogenic model for  studying the vre signal transduction pathways.
AB  == escherichia coli reporter strains modeling the high-level type a and b vancomycin resistances of enterococcus faecium bm4147 and ent. faecalis have been developed  to study the respective vanr-vans two-component regulatory systems. pvanh-, pvanra-, pvany-, and pvanrb-lacz fusions report on expression from the vancomycin-resistant enterococci promoters of the type a vanrshaxyz and type b vanrsywhbx gene clusters. these strains also express from single-copy chromosomal genes vanra, vanrb, or vanrsb behind their respective promoter (pvanra or pvanrb) or vansa or vansb behind the rhamnose-inducible prhab. results show that activation (phosphorylation) of the response regulator vanra by its sensor kinase vansa leads to transcriptional activation of both pvanh and pvanra. additionally, vanrb activates its cognate promoters pvany and pvanrb, although this occurs only in the absence of vansb and presumably is caused by vanrb phosphorylation by an unidentified endogenous e. coli kinase. thus, vansb interferes with activation of vanrb, probably by acting as a phospho-vanrb phosphatase. although both vanra and vanrb activate their cognate promoters, neither activates the heterologous pvanr, pvanh, or pvany, arguing against the interchangeability of type a and b two-component regulatory switches in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. vanra also is activated by the nonpartner kinase phor. because this occurs in the absence of its inducing signal (pi limitation), phor autophosphorylation apparently is regulated in vivo. furthermore, the activation of vanra caused by cross talk from phor in the absence of a signal allows distinction of cross talk from crossregulation as the latter, but not the former, responds to environmental cues.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

AB  == a panel of 266 clinically isolated gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli  with varying levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were analysed for susceptibility to du-6859a, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, temafloxacin and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci were divided into ciprofloxacin-susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant subgroups. du-6859a was the most potent quinolone  against all taxa. as ciprofloxacin resistance increased to high levels, mics of all quinolones increased but du-6859a mics increased least, and ciprofloxacin mics increased most. less susceptible single-step mutants were selected from 80%  of 15 representative clinical isolates exposed to ciprofloxacin, 71% of isolates  exposed to temafloxacin, 67% of isolates exposed to du-6859a and 53% of isolates  exposed to ofloxacin. du-6859a inhibited more mutants (67%) at a concentration of 1 mg/l than did the other quinolones (26-43%) at their susceptible breakpoints. du-6859a was the most rapidly bactericidal quinolone in time-kill studies with enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. this study indicated that du-6859a is more potent than the comparator quinolones, is less affected by the mechanisms responsible for high-level quinolone resistance and may be less likely to select resistant mutants if it has a susceptible breakpoint of 1 mg/l.

AB  == plasmid pmg1 (65.1 kb) was isolated from a gentamicin-resistant enterococcus faecium clinical isolate and was found to encode gentamicin resistance. ecori restriction of pmg1 produced five fragments, a through e, with molecular sizes of 50.2, 11.5, 2.0, 0.7, and 0.7 kb, respectively. the clockwise order of the fragments was acdeb. pmg1 transferred at high frequency to enterococcus strains in broth mating. pmg1 transferred between enterococcus faecalis strains, between  e. faecium strains, and between e. faecium and e. faecalis strains at a frequency of approximately 10(-4) per donor cell after 3 h of mating. the pmg1 transfers were not induced by the exposure of the donor cell to culture filtrates of plasmid-free e. faecalis fa2-2 or an e. faecium strain. mating aggregates were not observed by the naked eye during broth mating. small mating aggregates of several cells in the broth matings were observed by microscopy, while no aggregates of donor cells which had been exposed to a culture filtrate of e. faecalis fa2-2 or an e. faecium strain were observed, even by microscopy. pmg1 dna did not show any homology in southern hybridization with that of the pheromone-responsive plasmids and broad-host-range plasmids pambeta1 and pip501.  these results indicate that there is another efficient transfer system in the conjugative plasmids of enterococcus and that this system is different from the pheromone-induced transfer system of e. faecalis plasmids.

AB  == enterococci are normal intestinal flora in humans. among enterococci, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are frequently isolated and can become nosocomial pathogens in hospitals, especially in intensive care units and  oncology wards. recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) such as e. faecalis and e. faecium have caused a serious problem of hospital-acquired infections in europe and the usa. vre also has another aspect as a cause of community-acquired infections. especially, avoparcin which had been used to enhance growth of food animals is documented as associated with the spread of vre in european countries. in japan, there have only been a few of reports about vre  so far. however, there evidence that vre might become prevalent in many hospitals in japan. in fact, we have already isolated another highly vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vcm:mic > 128 micrograms/ml) from a hospitalized diabetic patient. we should pay a careful attention to vre and perform the following control measures: 1)re-education and re-training about hospital infection control procedures, 2) prudent use of vancomycin in clinical settings, 3)accurate report of vre in clinical laboratories, and 4) good communications and collaborations among physicians, nurses and other health care personnel and laboratory technicians. we should learn more from countries in which vre are already prevalent, and pursue further investigations, to prevent the spread of vre in japan.

TI  == colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci in chronic hemodialysis patients.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been identified with increased frequency in dialysis populations, but the risk factors for vre colonization are  not well defined in hemodialysis patients. patients from a university-affiliated  outpatient dialysis center had surveillance stool or rectal cultures for vre during april 1994 and january 1996. the combined cohort of 168 patients was followed-up for all-cause mortality, subsequent hospitalization, and vre infection. demographic and risk factor information, including age, gender, race,  diabetes, coronary artery disease (cad), and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, were collected on all patients. sixteen patients had surveillance cultures grow vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium or e faecalis (vref), and nine additional patients had clinical cultures positive for vref. the median follow-up time for patients with positive surveillance or clinical cultures for vref was 421 days versus 423 days for those without vref. patients with positive  surveillance cultures for vref had less time on hemodialysis before screening (median = 207 days v 822 days; p < 0.01), and more hospitalization in the year before screening (median = 19 days v 3 days, p < 0.01) compared with those without vref. patients with vref colonization were more likely to develop infection with vref (25% v 1%, p < 0.01) than those without vref colonization. however, adjusting for age, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) using cox-proportional hazards models, the presence of vref on screening culture was not associated with increased risk of death (rr = 1.1, p = 0.86). thus after adjusting for other comorbidities, vref colonization was not associated with increased mortality. patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd) on hemodialysis who are hospitalized are more likely to have vref, but longer duration on hemodialysis was not associated with presence of this organism. this suggests that vre transmission occurs predominantly in the inpatient setting.

TI  == the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  == butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two  strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate,  and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore,  butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.

AB  == two hundred and seventy-seven enterococcus isolates representing the predominating enterococcal flora of retailed chicken and pork were identified by  phenotypical features, and by random amplified polymorphic dna. the resistance to nine different antibiotics was determined. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently occurring species in both swedish and danish chicken. enterococcus faecalis and unidentified groups of enterococcus dominated in pork. seventy-three per cent of the enterococcus isolates from swedish chicken were resistant to one  or more of the tested antibiotics. the corresponding values for swedish pork, danish chicken and danish pork were 9%, 55% and 14%, respectively. tetracycline resistance was most frequent in isolates from danish pork and swedish chicken, while erythromycin resistance was most frequent in danish chicken. strains with acquired vancomycin resistance, mainly ent. faecium, were found only on danish chicken, except for one isolate from danish pork. all vancomycin-resistant isolates contained the vana gene. vancomycin resistance could be transferred to a vancomycin-sensitive ent. faecium strain from four of nine tested donor strains.

TI  == resistance of enterococci to ampicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics in italy. the italian surveillance group for antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == we report the results of the monitoring of resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin,  and teicoplanin in enterococci by an italian network of clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 16,226 strains were analyzed; 9,169 of these strains were enterococcus faecalis, 913 were enterococcus faecium, and 6,144 were enterococcus species. the average rate of resistance to ampicillin was 1.9% (range, 0-6.5%) for e. faecalis and 70% (range, 33.3%-98.7%) for e. faecium; the  average rate of resistance to vancomycin was 1.1% (range, 0.1%-2%) for e. faecalis and 8.5% (range, 0-36.1%) for e. faecium; and the average rate of resistance to teicoplanin was 0.8% (range, 0-2.4%) for e. faecalis and 8.7% (range, 0-36.1%) for e. faecium.

TI  == vancomycin resistance factor of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg in relation to enterococcal vancomycin resistance (van) genes.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (atcc 53103) is a probiotic strain used in fermented dairy products in many countries and is also used as a food supplement in the form of freeze-dried powder. the relationship of the vancomycin resistance factor in l. rhamnosus gg and the vancomycin resistance (van) genes of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium were studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), southern hybridization and conjugation methods. our results show that the vancomycin resistance determinant in l. rhamnosus gg is not closely related to enterococcal van genes, since no pcr product was amplified in l. rhamnosus gg with any of the three sets of vana primers used, and enterococcal vana, vanb, vnh, vanx, vanz, vany, vans and vanr genes did not hybridize with dna of l. rhamnosus gg. this strain does not contain plasmids and transfer of chromosomal vancomycin resistance determinant from l. rhamnosus gg to enterococcal species was not detected. our results are in accordance with previous findings of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == a new class of inhibitors of the two-component regulatory systems (tcs) of bacteria was discovered based on the salicylanilide screening hits, closantel (1) and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9). a systematic sar study versus a model tcs, kina/spo0f, demonstrated the importance of electron-attracting substituents in the salicyloyl ring and hydrophobic groups in the anilide moiety for optimal activity. in addition, derivatives 8 and 16, containing the 2, 3-dihydroxybenzanilide structural motif, were potent inhibitors of the autophosphorylation of the kina kinase, with ic50s of 2.8 and 6. 3 &microm, respectively. compound 8 also inhibited the tcs mediating vancomycin resistance (vans/vanr) in a genetically engineered enterococcus faecalis cell line at concentrations subinhibitory for growth. closantel (1), tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9), and several related derivatives (2, 7, 10, 11, 20) had antibacterial activity against the drug-resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref).

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility testing (agar disk diffusion and agar dilution) of clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium: comparison of mueller-hinton, iso-sensitest, and wilkins-chalgren agar media.
AB  == forty-two isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 56 isolates of enterococcus faecium, including 8 vancomycin-resistant strains, were examined for comparative  susceptibility to 27 antimicrobial drugs with the agar dilution method, employing mueller-hinton (mha), iso-sensitest (ista), and wilkins-chalgren (wca) agar. the  bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion method was used to comparatively test 24 of the agents in parallel. the enterococci yielded better growth on ista and wca. however, wca completely antagonized co-trimoxazole and, though less, fosfomycin.  importantly, wca slightly reduced the activities of teicoplanin (minimal inhibitory concentrations, mics, raised up to twofold) and vancomycin (mics raised two- to fourfold) against enterococci and staphylococcal quality control strains. therefore, wca was judged unsuitable for susceptibility testing of enterococci. for e. faecalis no discrepancies between agar dilution mics and inhibition zone diameters were encountered with augmentin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol, mupirocin, oxacillin, teicoplanin, and co-trimoxazole. overall, mha yielded fewer very major (category i) and major (category ii) discrepancies than ista. however, numerous minor (category iii), slight (category iv), minimal (category v), and/or negligible (category vi) discrepancies were encountered with ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, meropenem, ofloxacin and rifampin. with respect to e. faecium, only cefotaxime, mupirocin, oxacillin, and teicoplanin yielded nondiscrepant results. several very major (i) and major (ii) discrepancies were observed with augmentin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, doxycycline, fusidic acid, imipenem, and penicillin g. minor discrepancies (categories iii-vi) were particularly numerous with augmentin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and piperacillin. the largest numbers of negligible (vi) discrepancies were noted with fosfomycin, fusidic acid, and ofloxacin. it is recommended to test one cephalosporin (cefuroxime or the like) in parallel for educational purposes and to exclude fosfomycin, fusidic acid, and rifampin from test batteries because of the wide scatter of test results. the large number of minimal (v) discrepancies of ciprofloxacin against e. faecalis, the numerous minor (iii) and slight (iv) discrepancies of chloramphenicol against e. faecium,  and the not insignificant number of very major (i) and minor (iii) discrepancies  observed with meropenem against isolates of e. faecalis necessitated proposals for new disk intermediate susceptibility criteria.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in australia: phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of isolates.
AB  == enterococci with resistance to glycopeptides have recently emerged in australia.  we developed multiplex pcr assays for vana, vanb, vanc1, and vanc2 or vanc3 in order to examine the genetic basis for vancomycin resistance in australian isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (vre). the  predominant genotype from human clinical e. faecium isolates was vanb. the pcr van genotype was consistent with the resistance phenotype in all but six cases. one vana e. faecalis isolate had a vanb phenotype, one vanb e. faecium isolate had a vana phenotype, and four e. faecalis isolates were consistently negative for vana, vanb, vanc1, and vanc2 or vanc3, even though they exhibited a vanb phenotype. these four isolates were subsequently examined for the presence of vand by published methods and were found to be negative. no vancomycin-susceptible strains produced a pcr product. on the basis of our findings the epidemiology of vre in australia appears to be different from that in either the united states or europe. our multiplex pcr assays gave a rapid and  accurate method for determining the genotype and confirming the identification of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. rapid and accurate methods are essential, because laboratory-based surveillance is critical in programs for the detection,  control, and prevention of the transmission of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.

TI  == association between decreased susceptibility to a new antibiotic for treatment of human diseases, everninomicin (sch 27899), and resistance to an antibiotic used for growth promotion in animals, avilamycin.
AB  == the emergence of multiresistant bacteria has increased the need for new antibiotics or modifications of older antibiotics. one promising agent might be the everninomicin sch 27899, an oligosaccharide antibiotic recently developed by  schering plough. however, another oligosaccharide, avilamycin, that is structurally very similar has been used as a growth promoter for food animals in  the eu for several years, and a very frequent occurrence of resistance to avilamycin has been found among enterococcus faecium isolates from broilers in denmark. this study was conducted to investigate whether the resistance to avilamycin was associated with decreased susceptibility to everninomicin. from broilers, a total of 31 avilamycin susceptible and 55 avilamycin resistant (mic >16 microg/ml) e. faecium isolates were selected. from pigs, 21 avilamycin-susceptible and eight avilamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 50 avilamycin-susceptible and two avilamycin-resistant e. faecium isolates were selected. all isolates were tested for susceptibility to everninomicin by e-test. the avilamycin-susceptible enterococci isolates had mics to everninomicin from 0.064 to 0.75 microg/ml (mic50 = 0.38 microg/ml) and the avilamycin-resistant isolates had mics from 1.5 to 16 microg/ml (mic50 = 3 microg/ml). complete agreement between decreased susceptibility to avilamycin and everninomicin was found. this study showed that the use of avilamycin as a growth promoter for broilers and pigs has created a reservoir of e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates  with decreased susceptibility to everninomicin among food animals already before  this antibiotic have been finally developed for human use.

TI  == effects of different test conditions on mics of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
AB  == the influence of the addition of sheep blood to mueller-hinton ii agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without co2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. the antibacterial activity of bambermycin (flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. with all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in mic increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with co2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. this effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a co2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. for all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are mueller-hinton ii medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a co2-enriched atmosphere. however, when only e. faecium  and enterococcus faecalis are being tested, mueller-hinton ii medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.

AB  == a total of 200 medical center laboratories in the usa and canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly rp 59500 or synercid), against 28,029 gram-positive cocci. standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at mics of > or = 2 micrograms/ml). the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus was 0.5 microgram/ml and 1 microgram/ml, respectively. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was 1 microgram/ml, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. other enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were  usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml)  or vancomycin (86 to 95%; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml). among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90  (0.75 microgram/ml) for 4,626 tested streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. when five regions in the usa and canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible e. faecium. canadian strains were generally  more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested  against e. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). the u.s. southeast region had s. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among e. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. the northeast region of the usa had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (mics, > or = 4 micrograms/ml) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of e. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. the most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin  was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major gram-positive pathogens in north america, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.

TI  == multiple-drug resistant enterococci: the nature of the problem and an agenda for  the future.
AB  == enterococci, leading causes of nosocomial bacteremia, surgical wound infection, and urinary tract infection, are becoming resistant to many and sometimes all standard therapies. new rapid surveillance methods are highlighting the importance of examining enterococcal isolates at the species level. most enterococcal infections are caused by enterococcus faecalis, which are more likely to express traits related to overt virulence but--for the moment--also more likely to retain sensitivity to at least one effective antibiotic. the remaining infections are mostly caused by e. faecium, a species virtually devoid  of known overt pathogenic traits but more likely to be resistant to even antibiotics of last resort. effective control of multiple-drug resistant enterococci will require 1) better understanding of the interaction between enterococci, the hospital environment, and humans, 2) prudent antibiotic use, 3)  better contact isolation in hospitals and other patient care environments, and 4) improved surveillance. equally important is renewed vigor in the search for additional drugs, accompanied by the evolution of new therapeutic paradigms less  vulnerable to the cycle of drug introduction and drug resistance.

AB  == shuttle vector pat18 was transferred by conjugation from escherichia coli s17-1 to enterococcus faecalis og1rf and enterococcus faecium se34. transfer was mediated by the transfer functions of plasmid rk2 in e. coli s17-1 and the origin of conjugal transfer (orit) located on pat18. the orit sequence was then inserted into two plasmids to generate vectors ptex5235 and ptex5236. these two vectors cannot replicate in gram-positive bacteria and can be used to make insertion mutants in gram-positive bacteria. an internal sequence from an autolysin gene of e. faecalis og1rf was cloned into ptex5235 and transferred by conjugation from e. coli s17-1 to e. faecalis og1rf. the plasmid was found to integrate into the chromosome of og1rf by a single crossover event, resulting in a disrupted autolysin gene. a cosmid carrying the pyrimidine gene cluster from e. faecalis, with a transposon insertion in pyrc, was also transferred from e. coli s17-1 to e. faecalis og1rf. after selection for the transposon, it was found to have recombined into the recipient chromosome by a double crossover between the cosmid and the chromosome of og1rf. this resulted in a pyrc knockout mutant showing an auxotrophic phenotype.

AB  == carbamate kinase (ck) catalyzes the reversible reaction nh2coo- + atp <--> nhcoopo3(2-) + adp, serving to synthesize atp from carbamoyl phosphate in those microorganisms that derive energy from anaerobic arginine degradation via the arginine dihydrolase pathway. we report here the cloning and sequencing of the ck gene from enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and we demonstrate that  the amino acid sequence of ck is identical in the two species. the enzyme, expressed and isolated from escherichia coli using simple purification procedures, was used to generate crystals suitable for x-ray studies and to investigate the utilization by ck of bicarbonate and other carbamate analogs. ck  had a bicarbonate-dependent atpase activity and, therefore, is able to synthesize carboxyphosphate, an unstable compound that is an intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (cps) and by biotin carboxylase. other functional similarities with cps include the utilization of acetate by ck with a similarly high km and the similar km values of ck for carbamate and of cps for bicarbonate. enterococcal ck was inhibited by adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (ap5a) and ap6a and, less powerfully, by ap4a, whereas ap3a is essentially non-inhibitory. thus, inhibition by ap5a seems  not to be a valid criterion to differentiate between ck and cps, for the two enzymes can be inhibited by ap5a. all these results support the relatedness of ck and cps. finally, we used limited proteolysis: (a) to localize the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies obtained against ck; (b) to demonstrate the importance of the c-terminus for enzyme activity; and (c) to show that arg158 is highly exposed and may be essential for activity. comparison of the sequence of ck with known protein sequences demonstrates considerable similarity of ck with bacterial n-acetylglutamate kinases, strongly suggesting that these two enzymes may share a similar structure and the same catalytic mechanism.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. we examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the test strains represented a large  variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of dna fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of s. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mrsa strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to  all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. in the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/l (s. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/l (in mrsa and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/l) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the mic increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/l and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.

TI  == time-kill profiles of enterococcus to antibiotics used for intravitreal therapy.
AB  == background and objective: to determine and then compare the time-kill profiles of enterococcus to antibiotics used for intravitreal therapy. patients and methods:  the time-kill profiles of four endophthalmitis isolates of enterococcus faecalis, one vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolate, and three vancomycin-resistant isolates of e. faecium were determined against vancomycin, amikacin, cefazolin, gentamicin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, clindamycin, and the combinations of vancomycin and amikacin, vancomycin and ceftazidime, vancomycin and gentamicin, vancomycin and ampicillin, cefazolin and gentamicin, and ampicillin and gentamicin. results: no single antibiotic or combination was bactericidal (defined as 99.9% kill) to all isolates of enterococcus. gentamicin  was bactericidal to all e. faecalis isolates. none of the tested antibiotics were bactericidal to vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. conclusions: the time-kill profiles demonstrated that vancomycin and ceftazidime did not produce a 99.9% kill for e. faecalis in this small study. gentamicin combined with either cefazolin or ampicillin had somewhat better bactericidal activity and should be considered as an alternative therapy. novel therapy may be necessary to treat endophthalmitis because of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, depending on the susceptibility patterns of the individual isolate and the response to initial therapy.

AB  == enterococci are frequently isolated as nosocomial pathogens and have often acquired intrinsic drug resistances. molecular typing techniques have been developed to assist in epidemological and infection control measures. this study  investigates enterococci with high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) from the national university hospital (nuh) of singapore, and evaluates and compares three methods for typing: restriction enzyme analysis by conventional gel electrophoresis [restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp)], pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). fifty-two isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 13 isolates of enterococcus faecium were used for the study. the numbers of patterns obtained for e. faecalis and e. faecium were 26 and 4, respectively by the rflp method, and very similar discrimination was obtained by pfge. rapd pcr results were not reliably reproducible. a single pattern type by rflp accounted for 16 of the e. faecalis isolates, suggesting hospital spread.

AB  == 221 clinically significant enterococcal strains (191: e. faecalis, 27: e. faecium, 3 others) were isolated from the urine of patients hospitalised with uti over an 18-month period (1995-1996). the susceptibility of the isolates to 8 antimicrobial agents was determined by agar dilution method (nccls). all enterococci were sensitive to vancomycin and most of them (over 92%) to penicillin and ampicillin. only 3.14% of e. faecalis and 3.70% of e. faecium were resistant to ciprofloxacin. a relatively high incidence of resistance of enterococci to aminoglycosides was observed: 46.07% and 51.85% to streptomycin, 42.41% and 44.44% to gentamicin, 70.68% and 77.78% to amikacin for e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. among the resistant to penicillin and amino glycosides enterococci of the two species was found a great percent "high level"  resistance. there were no beta-lactamase producers among our strains. the established multiresistance accompanied by "high level" resistance requires careful consideration of antimicrobial therapy of enterococcal uti.

TI  == comparative in vitro and bactericidal activity of oxazolidinone antibiotics against multidrug-resistant enterococci.
AB  == increasing resistance among enterococci poses a considerable therapeutic problem. in this study, we evaluated the comparative in vitro activity of two investigational oxazolidinone antibiotics, eperezolid and linezolid, versus clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant enterococci. one hundred isolates (16 enterococcus faecalis, 69 e. faecium, 10 e. gallinarum, 2 e. casseliflavus, 1 e.  avium, 1 e. hirae, and 1 e. raffinosus) evaluated were collected from diverse geographic areas in north america and europe from 1991 to 1995. eperezolid mic50  and mic90 were 1.0 microgram/ml and 2.0 micrograms/ml (1.0-2.0 micrograms/ml range). linezolid mic50 and mic90 were 2.0 micrograms/ml and 2.0 micrograms/ml (0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml range), respectively. mics were the same at 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(8) cfu/ml initial inoculum. in time-kill experiments using 10 strains and  concentrations of 4 micrograms/ml, 8 micrograms/ml, and 16 micrograms/ml (achievable serum concentrations) of eperezolid and linezolid there was a 2 log10 reduction of growth for 2 of 10 isolates tested using eperezolid and a 1 log10 reduction for 50% of isolates with both agents. there was indifferent bactericidal killing when either oxazolidinone was combined with gentamicin, ampicillin, or streptomycin for isolates lacking these resistances. this study demonstrates these oxazolidinone agents to have excellent in vitro activity versus multidrug-resistant enterococci.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in liver transplant recipients.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) has become a significant nosocomial pathogen for immunosuppressed patients. during a 5-month period in 1993, 8 cases of invasive infection with vref (7 with bacteremia) were identified in liver transplant recipients, half of whom were adults. epidemiology and microbiology studies were designed to identify the source and to determine the risk factors for this infection. overall mortality was 50% (3 adults and 1 child). mortality in bacteremic patients was 57%. a case-control study showed that cases were more likely to have been treated with a third-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and to have undergone more than four biliary tract procedures. environmental surveillance cultures yielded only one vref isolate from a rectal temperature probe, but this device was used in only 2 of the cases. cultures from all surgery and radiology suites were negative. all vref isolates were genotyped by contour-clamped homogenous electric field electrophoresis of chromosomal dna restriction fragments. these studies showed that a single clone was responsible for the outbreak, although other clones could be detected in the  hospital. after implementing strict contact isolation on the liver transplant unit, only 1 additional patient with vref was identified during this outbreak. in conclusion, it was found that antibiotic use and biliary tract manipulation were  risk factors for developing invasive infections with vref after liver transplantation. optimal treatment is still unclear but most likely includes a combination of two or more antibiotics. prompt institution of infection control measures can preclude rapid spread of this nosocomial pathogen.

AB  == in order to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the netherlands, 624 hospitalized patients from intensive care units or hemato-oncology wards in nine hospitals and 200 patients living in the community  were screened for vre colonization. enterococci were found in 49% of the hospitalized patients and in 80% of the patients living in the community. of these strains, 43 and 32%, respectively, were enterococcus faecium. vre were isolated from 12 of 624 (2%) and 4 of 200 (2%) hospitalized patients and patients living in the community, respectively. pcr analysis of these 16 strains and 11 additional clinical vre isolates from one of the participating hospitals revealed 24 vana gene-containing, 1 vanb gene-containing, and 2 vanc1 gene-containing strains. all strains were cross-resistant to avoparcin but were sensitive to the  novel glycopeptide antibiotic ly333328. genotyping of the strains by arbitrarily  primed pcr and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. this underscores a lack of hospital-driven endemicity of vre clones. it is suggested that the vre in hospitalized patients have originated from unknown sources in the community.

TI  == semiquantitation of cooperativity in binding of vancomycin-group antibiotics to vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant organisms.
AB  == the association of vancomycin group antibiotics with the growing bacterial cell wall was investigated by using the cell wall precursor analog di-n-acetyl-lys-d-ala-d-ala in competition binding experiments. the affinities of the antibiotics for the -d-ala-d-ala-containing cell wall precursors of bacillus  subtilis atcc 6633 (a model for vancomycin-susceptible gram-positive bacteria) and for the -d-ala-d-lac-containing cell wall precursors of leuconostoc mesenteroides (a model for vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) were determined by a whole-cell assay. the binding of  strongly dimerizing antibiotics such as eremomycin to the bacterial surface was thus shown to be enhanced by up to 2 orders of magnitude (relative to the binding in free solution) by the chelate effect, whereas weakly dimerizing antibiotics like vancomycin and antibiotics carrying lipid tails (teicoplanin) benefited less (ca. 1 order of magnitude). the affinity measured in this way correlates well with the mic of the antibiotic, and a consequence of this is that future design of semisynthetic vancomycin-group antibiotics should attempt to incorporate chelate effect-enhancing structural features.

AB  == characteristics of nosocomial enterococcal blood stream infection (nebsi) isolates obtained from patients at 41 u.s. hospitals participating in the scope program were studied. isolates from 480 episodes of nebsi were characterized according to species and antimicrobial susceptibility profile. selected isolates  were also identified to species and vancomycin resistance genotype using polymerase chain reaction based methods. polymerase chain reaction genotyping and ribotyping were used as genetic markers for molecular epidemiologic typing. enterococci were the third most common cause of nosocomial blood stream infection in this study, accounting for 11.7% of all isolates reported. enterococcus faecalis was the most common species (59.6%), followed by e. faecium (19.4%). species identification errors involving e. faecium, e. durans, e. avium, and e. raffinosus were observed. vancomycin resistance was observed in 36.4% of all participating medical centers and varied from 11.1% of medical centers in the northwest to 60.9% of medical centers in the southwest. vancomycin-resistant enterococci accounted for 20.6% of nebsi in the northeast, 11.4% in the southeast, 11.1% in the southwest, and 9.5% in the northwest regions. vana genotypes predominated in the northeast and southwest, whereas vana and vanb genotypes were equally prevalent in the northwest and southeast. molecular typing studies identified strains that were unique to individual hospitals as well as strains that were prevalent in several different hospitals. nebsi with vancomycin-resistant enterococci continues to escalate among hospitalized patients in all geographic areas of the usa.

TI  == cloning of the staphylococcus aureus ddh gene encoding nad+-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase and insertional inactivation in a glycopeptide-resistant isolate.
AB  == the mechanism of low-level glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci is not known. a cytoplasmic protein, provisionally called ddh (w. m. milewski, s. boyle-vavra, b. moreira, c. c. ebert, and r. s. daum, antimicrob. agents chemother. 40:166-172, 1996), and the rna transcript that contains the ddh gene,  which encodes ddh, are present in increased amounts in a vancomycin-resistant isolate, 523k, compared with the susceptible parent isolate, 523. sequence analysis had previously revealed that ddh is related to nad+-dependent d-lactate  dehydrogenase (d-nldh) and vanh. this latter protein is essential for high-level  glycopeptide resistance in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis by synthesizing the d-lactate needed for biosynthesis of d-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for vancomycin. we now provide the direct evidence that the ddh gene product is staphylococcus aureus d-nldh and hereafter refer to the protein as d-nldh. however, overproduction of this protein in isolate 523k did not result in production of d-lactate-containing peptidoglycan precursors, and susceptibility testing of ddh mutants of 523k demonstrated that s. aureus d-nldh is not necessary for glycopeptide resistance in this isolate. we conclude that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in this isolate is distinct from that in enterococci.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus raffinosus: molecular epidemiology, species identification error, and frequency of occurrence in a national resistance surveillance program.
AB  == enterococcal blood stream infections are the third most common among all nosocomial blood stream infections in the united states and the occurrence of glycopeptide (vancomycin, teicoplanin) resistance in these isolates has markedly  increased. control of hospital-acquired infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci requires high quality antimicrobial susceptibility test methods and species identification procedures as a supplement to epidemiologic investigation  and appropriate infection control procedures. in this report, bacteremias caused  by enterococcus avium (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo, usa) were observed to be  enterococcus raffinosus infections (six of eight cases; 1.1% of all cases) when reference biochemical identification methods were applied. the vancomycin-susceptible e. raffinosis (two strains) and e. avium (two strains) had unique phenotypic and genotypic molecular profiles. in contrast, four vancomycin-resistant e. raffinosus strains (van a by polymerase chain reaction) from a single institution had the same phenotypic and molecular (pcr, pfge, ribotyping) pattern, indicating clonal dissemination among four patients over a 66-day period. clinical laboratories should be aware of the high probability that van a genes may be transferred from enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis to other more rarely encountered enterococcus species. also contemporary, widely  used commercial identification systems may fail to accurately identify those rare species. errors appear to be most prevalent for e. avium, enterococcus durans, and e. raffinosus based on the experience of the scope program.

TI  == are clinical laboratories in california accurately reporting vancomycin-resistant enterococci?
AB  == in order to determine whether hospital-based clinical laboratories conducting active surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in three san francisco bay area counties (san francisco, alameda, and contra costa counties) were accurately reporting vancomycin resistance, five vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains and one vancomycin-susceptible beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus were sent to 31 of 32 (97%) laboratories conducting surveillance. each strain was tested by the laboratory's routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. an enterococcus faecium strain with high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic, 512 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 100% of laboratories; an e. faecium strain with moderate-level resistance (mic, 64 microg/ml) was correctly reported as resistant by 91% of laboratories; two enterococcus faecalis strains with low-level resistance (mics, 32 microg/ml) were correctly reported as resistant by 97 and 56% of laboratories, respectively. an enterococcus gallinarum strain with intrinsic low-level resistance (mic, 8 microg/ml) was correctly reported as intermediate by 50% of laboratories. a beta-lactamase-producing e. faecalis isolate was correctly identified as susceptible to vancomycin by 100% of laboratories and as resistant to penicillin  and ampicillin by 68 and 44% of laboratories, respectively; all 23 (74%) laboratories that tested for beta-lactamase recognized that it was a beta-lactamase producer. this survey indicated that for clinically significant enterococcal isolates, laboratories in the san francisco bay area have problems in detecting low- to moderate-level but not high-level vancomycin resistance. increasing accuracy of detection and prompt reporting of these isolates and investigation of cases are the next steps in the battle for control of the spread of vancomycin resistance.

TI  == effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of  vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or  = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1  gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

TI  == molecular epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci in cincinnati, ohio: a prospective citywide survey.
AB  == to determine patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococci and to assess molecular characteristics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 157 clinical blood isolates of enterococci from 10 hospitals in cincinnati, ohio, were prospectively collected during a 6-month period from february to july 1995.  the isolates included 108 (69%) e. faecalis isolates, 46 (29%) e. faecium isolates, and 1 isolate each of e. avium, e. durans, and e. gallinarum. the e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates differed in their susceptibilities to ampicillin (100 versus 20%), ampicillin-sulbactam (100 versus 13%), vancomycin (100 versus 57%), imipenem (94 versus 2%), and high levels of gentamicin (59 versus 83%). supplemental susceptibility testing of the 21 vancomycin-resistant isolates showed that 21 (100%) were susceptible to chloramphenicol and that only 7 (33%) were susceptible to doxycycline. nineteen (90%) of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolates were of the vanb phenotype, with vanb resistance genes detected  by pcr and hybridization with gene-specific probes; and the e. gallinarum isolates demonstrated the vanc phenotype with the vanc1 gene. one vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolate was highly resistant to both teicoplanin  and vancomycin, corresponding to the vana phenotype; however, it was found to have the vanb gene. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed that all of  the 19 e. faecium isolates with the vanb phenotype had identical to closely related banding patterns. hybridization of restriction enzyme-digested dna separated by pfge with a vanb gene probe demonstrated differences in the locations of vanb genes that corresponded closely to the pfge banding patterns. our study has documented that the emerging vancomycin resistance in our city was  mainly due to the clonal dissemination of a single strain of e. faecium vanb.

AB  == roncal and idiazabal cheeses are manufactured from ewe's milk in the autonomous region of navarre in spain. levels of enterococci are high in these cheeses and in other types of ewe's-milk cheeses. the present study has identified enterococci present in the milk used and in the roncal and idiazabal cheeses after 120 days of ripening. a total of 282 strains were isolated and identified,  and the cytoplasmic and extracellular enzymatic activities of some of the strains were assessed. the dominating species were enterococcus faecalis, which accounted for 85% of the total both in the milk as well as in the two types of cheese, and  enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and enterococcus avium which were present in lower proportions. aminopeptidase and proteinase activity levels in enterococci were low, and considerable variation between strains of the same species was recorded, highlighting the need to study individual strains when selecting the most suitable bacteria as a starter culture. aminopeptidase activity levels for the enterococci were appreciably higher at ph 7 than at ph 5.5, hence aminopeptidase activity by enterococci would appear to be less significant in the normal manufacturing conditions of the two cheeses.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of enterococci in germany].
AB  == background: the resistance of enterococci against various antimicrobial substances including vancomycin has increased markedly. since 1989 in the usa in  particular high resistance rates against vancomycin have been observed but very few surveillance have been published in europe. therefore, we conducted a multicenter study in germany to obtain information about the incidence and distribution of vancomycin and/or high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. methods: a total of 2046 enterococcal isolates were identified and susceptibility-testing was performed according to international guidelines. results: a total number of 90.5% of the enterococcal isolates were identified as  enterococcus faecalis and 7.8% was enterococcus faecium. resistance against ampicillin was detected in 56.6% of the enterococcus faecium isolates, however, in only one enterococcus faecalis isolate. high-level resistance against gentamycin or streptomycin was observed in 7.3% and 24.8% of the isolates, respectively. twelve isolates showed resistance against vancomycin, however, cross resistance with teicoplanin was found in only two isolates. conclusion: the rate of resistance of enterococci in germany is still considerably lower than in  the united states. previous vancomycin therapy has been implemented as a risk factor for colonization or infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. continued vigilance, decreased use of vancomycin and strict enforcement of infection control measures are appropriate measures to control the growing problem of resistant enterococci.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

(mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

(mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem dz-2640.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == [vancomycin resistant enterococci in austria].
AB  == this study reports pheno- and genotypical analysis of 9 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and 5 vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (vse) in austria: 5 e, faecium isolates of 4 patients (the sole patients demonstrating vre at the university hospital of innsbruck in 1994 and 1995), 3 glycopeptide-sensitive isolates collected in innsbruck in february 1996 for epidemiological analysis, and 6 enterococcus isolates from the university hospitals of vienna and graz. the pheno- and genotypical analyses of all glycopeptide highly resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates indicated the presence of vana type resistance. one e. casseliflavus strain with intrinsic vanc-1 resistance showed a characteristic constitutive low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. genotyping with macro-restriction analysis demonstrated that 3 vre isolates of the 5 e. faecium specimens were identical; the same applied to 2 vse isolates. the two patients with vre had been cared for at the same time in a surgical icu and likewise, the two patients with  vse were simultaneously treated at a neurological icu. the genotyping of e. faecalis strains showed that two strains of the three vre isolates exhibited identical patterns. epidemiological investigation did not reveal a mode of transmission for this cluster. two of the 8 patients with vre died within 60 days after isolation of the bacteria; the doctors in charge did not consider that the  enterococci had been the cause of death. the results of our study indicate that oral vancomycin administration to humans is a primary cause of vre in austrian hospitals. in austria approximately 66 kg vancomycin, 20% of it given orally, are administered to patients per year. approx. 18-20 tons avotan (active ingredient avoparcin-10%)/year were used in austria; as of april 1, 1997 the use of this animal foodstuff supplement is prohibited by the european commission.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against enterococcus spp. was  compared with that of amoxycillin, vancomycin, telcoplanin and erythromycin. the  susceptibility of 106 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis, 92 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) was tested. only one strain of vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium was not susceptible to < or = 0.5 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin; this strain required 4 mg/l. all strains of e. faecalis were inhibited by < or = 8 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin and all vre strains were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/l. in contrast, teicoplanin and vancomycin showed inhibitory activity against  e. faecalis and e. faecium but not against vre. amoxycillin was active against e. faecalis but not usually against e. faecium and showed variable activity against  vre; 38% of e. faecalis, 84% of e. faecium and 80% of vre strains were resistant  to erythromycin. the bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against e. faecium exceeded that of the comparator drugs as judged by mic:mbc ratios and  killing curves. the mbc99 of quinupristin/dalfopristin determined by a microdilution broth technique was < or = 1 mg/l for e. faecium. four of the five  strains of vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium and three of the five vre strains tested with time-kill curves showed a > or = 2 log reduction in viable count after exposure to quinupristin/dalfopristin for 6 h.

TI  == species identification of enterococci via intergenic ribosomal pcr.
AB  == accurate species identification of enterococci has become important with the wide prevalence of acquired vancomycin resistance and the presence of less epidemiologically important, inherently vancomycin-resistant enterococci. using a collection of enterococcal strains, we found that pcr amplification of the intergenic spacer (its-pcr) between the 16s and 23s rrna genes can produce amplicon profiles characteristic of the enterococcus examined. the species examined were group i enterococci (enterococcus avium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus pseudoavium), group ii enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, and enterococcus gallinarum), and group iii enterococci (enterococcus durans and enterococcus hirae). the enterococcal species in group i, as well as e. faecalis and two strains of e. hirae, were similar and therefore had to be differentiated from each other by sau3a restriction digests. this produced patterns characteristic of each of these species. the remaining group ii and group iii enterococcal species produced amplicons characteristic of a particular species except e. gallinarum. the pcr products from e. gallinarum displayed strain-to-strain heterogeneity in the number and size of amplicons. to  further test the utility of this technique, 11 phenotypically aberrant strains which had been assigned species identification based on facklam and collins-type  strain reactions (r.r. facklam and m.d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734,  1989) were subjected to its-pcr. its-pcr of the phenotypically aberrant strains identified six strains with reactions consistent with those of type strains. however, five strains were characterized as follows: two strains originally identified as e. mundtii were identified by its-pcr as e. casseliflavus, one strain originally identified as e. raffinosus was identified by its-pcr as e. durans, one strain originally identified as e. hirae was identified by its-pcr as e. faecium [corrected]. we conclude that amplification of the intergenic 23s and  16s rrna gene regions of enterococci provides a reliable technique for species identification of enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == skin colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci among hospitalized patients with bacteremia.
AB  == to assess the prevalence of skin and rectal colonization by vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) in hospitalized bacteremic patients and to determine the relation between colonization and bacteremia, we compared 14 case patients who had bacteremia due to vre with 30 control patients who had bacteremia due to other pathogens. rectal colonization and skin (inguinal area and/or antecubital fossa) colonization with vre were common among both case patients (100% had rectal colonization, and 86% had skin colonization) and control patients (37% had rectal colonization and 23% had skin colonization). among patients with rectal colonization, skin colonization was more common when diarrhea or fecal incontinence was present. the bloodstream cleared without appropriate antimicrobial therapy in nine of the 14 patients with bacteremia due to vre. the  high prevalence of skin colonization with vre may increase the risk of catheter-related sepsis, cross-infection, or blood culture contamination (which may explain the frequent spontaneous resolution of bacteremia due to vre).

TI  == evaluation of arbitrarily primed pcr analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of large genomic dna fragments for identification of enterococci  important in human medicine.
AB  == the increasing problems encountered with enterococcal nosocomial infections and the intrinsic and acquired resistance of the enterococci to different antimicrobial compounds highlight the need for a rapid identification technique.  enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. in the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a pcr-based species-specific identification protocol. whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. in addition, the genomic smai macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). oligonucleotide d11344-primed pcr was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. this pcr-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the dna profiles obtained. the inability of both methods to discriminate between enterococcus casseliflavus and  enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of e. flavescens. pfge did not result in species-discriminative dna bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.

TI  == primary and secondary structures of rrna spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  == the 16s-23s and 23s-5s rrna spacer dna regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans and enterococcus mundtii were amplified by pcr. their  nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. whereas lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without trna(ala) were characterized. however, as shown for lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto, the trna(ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal cca trinucleotide. a putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the trna(ala) gene. based on comparison with lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. in e, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no trna(ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. a similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in e. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23s rrna coding sequences of some gram-negative bacteria. the spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the trna(ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of dna-based typing methods.

AB  == thirty-seven strains of enterococci isolated from milk and milk products from santa fe (argentina) region were tested for antagonistic activity against vibrio  cholerae 01 and non-01. seven of 17 strains of enterococcus faecalis, five of 10  strains of enterococcus faecium and four of 10 strains of enterococcus durans produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. the activity of the antibacterial compounds was completely destroyed by treatment with trypsin and pronase e in most cases (only the supernatant fluids of a few strains remained weakly active after the treatment), but was resistant to heat treatment at 100 degrees c during 10 and 30 min. when the 10-fold concentrated supernatant fluids  were added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. according to these preliminary tests, different strains of enterococci produced compounds with slightly different antivibrio properties, and these compounds were heat-resistant and had a predominantly proteinaceous nature.

TI  == in vitro activity and spectrum of ly333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  == reference methods were used to determine the potency of ly333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key n-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) (in micrograms per milliliter) of ly333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for streptococcus serogroups a, b, c, and g, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%;  and for vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. ly333328 was not active (mic50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of  enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic neisseria  spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. gram-positive anaerobes were ly333328  susceptible (mics, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). test methods and conditions may have  affected mics of ly333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution mics being greater than the broth microdilution mics.

TI  == comparison of agar-based media for primary isolation of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  == objective: to compare four vancomycin-containing agar media for the isolation of  glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) from clinical fecal specimens: kanamycin---aesculin---azide (kaa) agar; bile---aesculin---polymixin (bap) agar;  aztreonam---amphotericin blood (cbaa) agar; and neomycin blood (cbn) agar. methods: fecal specimens from 125 patients were inoculated onto each medium. media were examined for enterococci after incubation for up to 48 h. enterococci  were identified to species level, and glycopeptide phenotypes were determined by  measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin. results: gre were isolated from 44/125 samples. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates, expressing glycopeptide resistance of the vana or  vanb phenotypes, were recovered from 27/33 (82%) specimens on bap medium, 26/33 (79%) on kaa medium, and 21/33 (64%) on cbn and cbaa media. enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus isolates expressing low-level glycopeptide resistance (vanc phenotype) were recovered from 14/15 (93%) specimens on cbaa medium, 7/15 (47%) on kaa and cbn media, and 6/15 (40%) on bap  medium. conclusions: the media tested in this study, with the exception of cbn medium, detected at least 75% of patients colonized by gre. further development of bap, cbaa and kaa media is warranted to improve growth and selectivity.

TI  == high incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in sweden.
AB  == the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (icus) at a university hospital in sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to  1996. an increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. after a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of e. faecium isolates declined during 1996. the oxacillin resistance rates for staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were oxacillin resistant. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for cns and enterococci spp. were high. relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among enterobacter spp. were also seen. during 1995 and 1996 pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. this was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. the overall resistance rates for gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. from 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption  decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the icus. however, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. in contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of icu patients treated during this period. the conclusion is that all icus within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order  to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. it is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the icus in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. an update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  == although resistance has developed among gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. however, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the usa but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this european surveillance study. the european glycopeptide resistance survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. the primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their  glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in european hospitals. the in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the italian centres. in total, 7078 gram-positive isolates were collected in europe, and national coordinators used the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. according to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus. in general, the range of mics for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. against enterococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was  4 times more active than vancomycin. the greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in enterococcus faecium than in e. faecalis. the results from the italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. in particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. the incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in europe  (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). this extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.

TI  == stool cultures obtained before liver transplantation are useful for choice of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == bacterial infections, especially cholangitis, are still common complications after liver transplantation (ltx). during recent years, multiresistant enterococci have become a nosocomial problem in transplant units. the present prospective study on 26 patients, including 24 patients with chronic liver disease, demonstrated that enterococci were the predominant micro-organism involved in post-ltx bacterial infections. they were cultured in the feces and in other sites of 10 out of 13 (77%) patients who underwent extensive examinations.  ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains were isolated in urine or feces of 2 of the 13 patients prior to ltx. similarly, resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin, the empirically used antibiotics for patients with fever of unknown origin, was found in e. faecium strains in 3 and 2 patients, respectively. moreover, multiresistant e. faecium and e. faecalis strains were demonstrated in  46% of the patients in the postoperative period (3 months). however, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. the use of antibiotics within 4 months prior to ltx significantly increased the risk of developing ampicillin-resistant bacteria at the time of ltx and of infections with bacteria  of enteric origin after ltx (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). we conclude that stool and urine cultures performed prior to ltx may be useful for selecting prophylactic antibiotic regimens.

TI  == glucose starvation response in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  == we investigated the survival of enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. inhibition of protein synthesis by  chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. during the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (a, b, c and d) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. our results show that proteins from the two early classes (a and b) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in e. faecalis. one protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. the n-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class a, showed strong homology with the n-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from streptococcus faecium. this enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the cst proteins of escherichia coli.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from blood samples in three hospitals in madrid (spain) from 1994 to 1995. methods: one hundred strains, 83 enterococcus faecalis, 15 e. faecium, and 2 e. durans, isolated from january 1994 to april 1995 were studied.  the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 11 antimicrobians were determined  by the agar dilution method. results: four percent of the strains were resistant  to ampicillin and 7% to penicillin. ninety-two percent were sensitive to vancomycin. the percentage of strains with a high level of resistance (hlr) to some aminoglucoside was 60%. hlr was observed to gentamycin in 41%, to streptomycin in 46% and to kanamycin in 58% of the strains. half of the isolates  were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested. hlr was significantly associated with aminoglucosides with hlr (mic > or = 16 mg/l) to fluoroquinolones in the strains studied (p < 0.001). conclusions: the incidence of resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin is low and very high to aminoglucosides and fluoroquinolones. there is also a very significant association between hlr to fluoroquinolones and hlr to aminoglucosides.

TI  == the vans sensor negatively controls vanr-mediated transcriptional activation of glycopeptide resistance genes of tn1546 and related elements in the absence of induction.
AB  == transposon tn1546 from enterococcus faecium bm4147 encodes a histidine protein kinase (vans) and a response regulator (vanr) that regulate transcription of the  vanhax operon encoding a dehydrogenase (vanh), a ligase (vana), and a d,d-dipeptidase (vanx). these last three enzymes confer resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics by production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in the  depsipeptide d-alanyl-d-lactate. transcription of vans and the role of vans in the regulation of the vanhax operon were analyzed by inserting a cat reporter gene into vans. transcription of cat and vanx was inducible by glycopeptides in partial diploids harboring vans and vans(omega)cat but was constitutive in strains containing only vans(omega)cat. promoters p(r) and p(h), located upstream from vanr and vanh, respectively, were cloned into a promoter probing vector to study transactivation by chromosomally encoded vanr and vans. the promoters were  inactive in the absence of vanr and vans, inducible by glycopeptides in the presence of both genes, and constitutively activated by vanr in the absence of vans. thus, induction of the vanhax operon involves an amplification loop resulting from binding of phospho-vanr to the p(r) promoter and increased transcription of the vanr and vans genes. full activation of p(r) and p(h) by vanr was observed in the absence of vans, indicating that the sensor negatively controls vanr in the absence of glycopeptides, presumably by dephosphorylation. activation of the vanr response regulator in the absence of vans may involve autophosphorylation of vanr with acetyl phosphate or phosphorylation by a heterologous histidine protein kinase.

AB  == streptococcus bovis nem760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. strain nem760 was identified as s. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16s rrna. this strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (mic, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (mic, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. the presence of a vanb-related gene in nem760 was demonstrated in a pcr assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanb. sequence analysis of the corresponding pcr product revealed that it was highly homologous  (96% identity) to the prototype vanb sequence of enterococcus faecalis v583. the  vanb resistance of determinant of s. bovis nem760 was transferred by conjugation  to e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per  donor. smai-digested genomic dnas of independently obtained transconjugants of e. faecalis and e. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization with a vanb dna probe. the electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanb-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. these results suggest that the genes mediating vanb-type resistance in s. bovis nem760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. the results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == forty-four enterococcal strains isolated from human clinical specimens were investigated for binding of 125i-labeled fibronectin, vitronectin, thrombospondin, lactoferrin, and collagen type i and iv, and for cell surface hydrophobicity. most strains expressed low binding of iodine-labeled human fibronectin, collagen i and iv, and higher binding of human vitronectin, human lactoferrin, and human thrombospondin. bacteria grown in todd-hewitt broth exhibited increased binding to vitronectin and thrombospondin. in particle agglutination assays (paa), enterococcus faecalis strains reacted strongly with coated latex beads in contrast to e. faecium strains, which generally did not react. the ability of enterococci to bind ecm proteins was affected by heating and proteolytic digestion, suggesting that some protein-binding components become surface exposed after treatment with proteases. the binding of 125i-labeled proteins to e. faecalis strain e70 was inhibited when cells were preincubated with unlabeled proteins. preincubating cells with sulfated polymers such as dextran sulfate (mr 5000 and 8000), pentosan sulfate and heparin decreased binding of vitronectin, lactoferrin, and thrombospondin. the binding of lactoferrin and thrombospondin was also decreased when bacteria were preincubated with galactose, fucose, and mannosamine, but not with mannose. all of 30 e. faecalis strains expressed pronounced surface hydrophobicity, but 10 of 14 e. faecium strains showed hydrophilic cell surface.

AB  == enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the united states. although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. raffinosus, and e. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. in january 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31  of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as e. durans. twenty-nine isolates identified as e. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (vitek gram-positive identification card, version r09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. when seven isolates initially reported as e.  durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be e. faecium. subsequently, isolates identified as e. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as e. durans. automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. when laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.

AB  == enterococcus faecium strains with vana-mediated glycopeptide resistance were isolated by enrichment culture from the intestines and feces of several animal species, mainly horses and dogs (8% positive), chickens (7% positive), and pigs (6% positive). other vana-positive enterococcal strains were identified as e. durans in gallinaceous birds, e. faecalis in a horse, and e. gallinarum in a pheasant. samples from pigeons, cage birds, and ruminants were negative. it was concluded that vancomycin resistance is widespread among isolates from farm and pet animals.

AB  == enterococcus gallinarum and e. casseliflavus are difficult to differentiate from  other enterococci, particularly e.faecium. the former two species were found to produce acid from methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside in phenol red broth, while e.faecalis strains and strains of the e.faecium species group, including e.faecium, e.durans, e. hirae, and e.mundtii, failed to produce acid from this substrate.

TI  == survey of enterococcal susceptibility patterns in belgium.
AB  == a national surveillance study was performed in order to identify the enterococci  causing important infections, to determine their susceptibilities to first-choice agents for treatment, and to characterize the phenotypes and genotypes of the glycopeptide-resistant strains. a total of 472 isolates were collected between 15 january and 15 april 1993. the ability of the api rapid id 32 strep gallery to identify enterococci was evaluated. the majority of the belgian enterococci were  identified as e. faecalis (89.4%). e. faecium and other enterococci were present  in small percentages only (9.1 and 1.5%, respectively). the api rapid id 32 strep system identified 88.6% of the strains with an excellent or very good identification score. for the majority of the strains with uncertain identification scores, the results of a single test only were aberrant. only 2.3% of the strains remained unidentified. high-level aminoglycoside resistance was widespread in e. faecalis (streptomycin, 50.8%; gentamicin, 8.7%), and the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance was found to be associated with aminoglycoside resistance. e. faecium is generally more resistant to a wide range of antibiotics, but glycopeptide-resistant strains (1.5%) have not yet become widespread.

TI  == susceptibility of ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci to trovafloxacin.
AB  == the susceptibilities of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci obtained over a 13-year period were tested for trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, and ciprofloxacin. for mrsa, mic50 values for trovafloxacin increased from 0.03 microgram/ml to 1 microgram/ml from 1984-1985 to 1995-1996, but were lower than those noted for ciprofloxacin, which  increased from 0.25 microgram/ml to > 8 micrograms/ml during the same period. trovafloxacin also showed lower mic50 values (0.12-0.25 microgram/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic50 of 0.5-1 microgram/ml) for e. faecalis isolates from 1985 through 1991, but against e. faecium and e. faecalis isolated in 1995-1996, the mic50 values for both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 2 micrograms/ml and the mic90 values were > or 8 micrograms/ml. thus, cross-resistance between fluoroquinolones was shown for both enterococci and mrsa. whether the greater intrinsic activity of trovafloxacin might allow its use in treating mrsa and enterococcal infections remains to be seen.

TI  == gentamicin resistance gene transfer from enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium to  staphylococcus aureus, s. intermedius and s. hyicus.
AB  == transfer of gentamicin resistance from enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium to staphylococcus aureus, s. hyicus and s. intermedius was accomplished by filter mating. transfer from e. faecalis was plasmid mediated and a probe to the gentamicin resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2") hybridized to hindiii fragments of various sizes (7.5, 6.2 and 4.7 kbp) of these plasmids. transfer from e. faecium  was apparently to the chromosome in 9 of 10 instances with hindiii fragments of 3.3 or 3.0 kbp hybridizing to the probe. these results are consistent with transposon mediated resistance. plasmid transfers to s. intermedius were at much  lower frequencies than to s. aureus or to s. hyicus but presumed transposon transfer direct to the chromosome was equal in all three species.

AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  == the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500) are described. quinupristin-dalfopristin is  the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. streptogramin  drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when  administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the combination is more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis. it has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. the mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/l for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/l for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear  correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. the drug is under investigation in the  united states in phase iii trials. of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving e. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. the efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. the drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. adverse reactions are generally mild and transient.  quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.

TI  == structure of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 pbp5fm in wild-type and highly penicillin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == among its penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), enterococcus faecium possesses a low-affinity pbp5, pbp5fm, which is the main target involved in beta-lactam resistance. a 7.7-kb ecori chromosomal fragment of e. faecium d63r containing the pbp5fm gene was cloned and sequenced. two open reading frames (orfs) were found.  a 2,037-bp orf encoded the deduced 73.8-kda pbp5fm, the amino acid sequences of which were, respectively, 99.8, 78.5, and 62% homologous to those of the low-affinity plasmid-encoded pbp3r of enterococcus hirae s185r and the chromosome-encoded pbp5 of e. hirae r40 and enterococcus faecalis 56r. a second 597-bp orf, designated psrfm, was found 2.3 kb upstream of pbp5fm. it appeared to be 285 bp shorter than and 74% homologous with the regulatory gene psr of e. hirae atcc 9790. different clinical isolates of e. faecium, for which a wide range of benzylpenicillin mics were observed, showed that the increases in mics were related to two mechanisms. for some strains of intermediate resistance (mics of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), the increased level of resistance could be explained  by the presence of larger quantities of pbp5fm which had an affinity for benzylpenicillin (second-order rate constant of protein acylation [k+2/k] values  of 17 to 25 m(-1) s(-1)) that remained unchanged. for the two most highly resistant strains, efm-1 (mic, 90 micrograms/ml) and h80721 (mic, 512 micrograms/ml), the resistance was related to different amino acid substitutions  yielding very-low-affinity pbp5fm variants (k+2/k < or = 1.5 m(-1) s(-1)) which were synthesized in small quantities. more specifically, it appeared, with a three-dimensional model of the c-terminal domain of pbp5fm, that the substitutions of met-485, located in the third position after the conserved sdn triad, by thr in efm-1 and by ala in h80721 were the most likely cause of the decreasing affinity of pbp5fm observed in these strains.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

AB  == despite growing concern about vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) as nosocomial pathogens, especially in the united states, in italy vre still represent an uncommon and occasional experience for most diagnostic laboratories. we report a genotypic characterization of the first reported nosocomial outbreak  of vre in italy. some experiments, including plasmid analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) assays, aimed at investigating the genetic relatedness of the vre isolates. other experiments, based on hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, aimed at characterizing the vancomycin resistance determinants. over a 6-month period, 21 vre, all identified as enterococcus faecalis, were isolated from eight patients (all treated earlier with glycopeptide antibiotics) in a neurosurgical intensive care unit. all isolates had the same biochemical profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern, including high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and vancomycin and teicoplanin mics of 256 and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively. three plasmids, one strongly hybridizing with a vana probe, were detected in all but the last of the 21 vre isolates. the  last isolate of the cluster lacked the smallest of the three plasmids. similar restriction profiles were obtained after plasmid dna digestion with several endonucleases, with minor differences appreciated only in the first and last isolates. analysis of genomic dna restriction fragment patterns by pfge confirmed that the reported cluster of vre isolations was due to a single nosocomial strain of e. faecalis, despite some modifications in plasmid dna at the beginning and at the end of the outbreak. completely different pfge patterns were yielded by vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis strains isolated during the same period from inpatients in the same intensive care unit. hybridization experiments with vana and vans-vanh probes and dna amplification assays using 14 pcr primer pairs specific for vana cluster genes (vanr, vans, vanh, vana, and vany), orf1, orf2, vanb, and vanc showed identical organization of resistance determinants in all epidemic vre isolates. this organization appeared to be the same as that described for tn1546 in vana prototype strain e. faecium bm4147.

TI  == the gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific dna probe.

TI  == intrinsic penicillin resistance in enterococci.
AB  == penicillin resistance development in enterococci has been associated with overproduction of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (pbp) that is a normal component of the pbp pattern of these bacteria and is apparently able to substitute the functions of the other pbps. in resistant mutants of enterococcus  hirae atcc 9790 the low-affinity pbp (pbp5) overproduction was associated with a  deletion in a genetic element, located 1 kb upstream of the pbp5 gene, which negatively controlled pbp5 synthesis. hypersusceptibility to penicillin was associated with a point mutation in the pbp5 gene, which causes premature termination of translation. structural homologies between low-affinity pbps of the different enterococcal species have been suggested by cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against e. hirae pbp5 with pbp5 of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. acquisition of a high-level ampicillin resistance in e. faecium was associated with overproduction of pbp5, which, compared with pbp5 of  moderately resistant strains, appeared to be modified in its penicillin-binding capability. the modified phenotype of pbp5 was found to be associated to some amino acid substitutions in the region between the sdn and ktg motifs. in particular, the substitution converting a polar residue (t) in a nonpolar one (a  or i) could play an important role in remodeling the penicillin-binding domain and determining the decrease in penicillin affinity.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the metabolism of soluble cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  == transposon tn1546 from enterococcus faecium bm4147 mediates high-level resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin. tn 1546 encodes a dehydrogenase (vanh) and a ligase (vana) that synthesize d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-ala-d-lac), a d,d-dipeptidase (vanx) that hydrolyses d-ala-d-ala and a two-component regulatory system (vanr-vans) that controls transcription of the vanhax operon. strains of enterococcus faecalis harbouring various copy numbers of the vanrshax cluster were tested to determine if there was a correlation between the levels of resistance to glycopeptides, the levels of expression of the corresponding resistance genes and the relative proportions of the different  cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors. increased transcription of the vanhax operon was associated with increased incorporation of d-ala-d-lac into peptidoglycan precursors to the detriment of d-ala-d-ala, and with a gradual increase in the vancomycin-resistance levels. more complete elimination of d-ala-d-ala-containing precursors was required for teicoplanin resistance. the vany and vanz proteins also encoded by tn1546 were not effectors of the regulation of the vanhax operon but contributed to vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance, respectively. differences at the regulatory level accounted for phenotypic diversity in acquired glycopeptide resistance by production of d-lac-ending precursors.

TI  == revised approach for identification and detection of ampicillin and vancomycin resistance in enterococcus species by using microscan panels.
AB  == the frequency of antimicrobial agent-resistant enterococci is increasing, making  accurate identification and screening for susceptibility essential. we evaluated  the ability of microscan positive breakpoint combo type 6 panels (dade microscan  inc., west sacramento, calif.) to identify enterococcus species and to detect ampicillin and vancomycin resistance. a total of 398 well-characterized enterococcus isolates from two institutions were inoculated into microscan panels, into conventional biochemical assays, and into ampicillin and vancomycin  agar dilution media. resistance was verified by the broth macrodilution method. microscan panels accurately detected resistance to ampicillin in 132 of 132 enterococcal isolates, while three isolates for which the mics were < 16 micrograms/ml were classified incorrectly by microscan panels as resistant. no beta-lactamase-producing enterococci were detected. all 64 isolates showing resistance to vancomycin (mics > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were correctly classified by microscan panels. seven isolates for which the vancomycin mics were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml were incorrectly classified as susceptible by microscan panels, while eight isolates for which the mics were 4 micrograms/ml were incorrectly labeled as intermediate. fourteen of these 15 isolates were subsequently identified as motile enterococci. overall, there were three major errors in susceptibility testing for ampicillin and 15 minor errors for vancomycin. conventional testing confirmed the identity of 181 enterococcus faecalis isolates, 157 e. faecium isolates, and 60 isolates of other species; however, 56  of these 60 isolates were misidentified by the microscan panels. after recognition of this problem, a revised approach which included tests for pigment, motility, and sucrose fermentation was devised. in combination with these additional assays, the conventional microscan panels accurately identified the 56 originally misidentified isolates. in summary, the ability of microscan panels to detect vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in enterococci was confirmed. our study found that the inability of microscan panels to identify enterococci other  than e. faecalis and e. faecium can be compensated for by the addition of standard assays.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == objective: to review vancomycin resistance in enterococci (enterococcus faecalis  and enterococcus faecium) with respect to history, epidemiology, mechanism of resistance, and management. data sources: a medline, idis, and current journal search of english-language articles on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) published between 1982 and 1994 was conducted. study selection: studies and reports pertaining to vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium were evaluated. case reports, cohort, epidemiologic, in vitro and in vivo studies were evaluated. data extraction: reports in which vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations were 32 micrograms/ml or more were evaluated. data synthesis: large outbreaks of vre infection have occurred as a result of nosocomial spread.  such outbreaks have required intensive infection control procedures to limit the  spread of vre. vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium has been subdivided into phenotypes, vana and vanb. the mechanism of vancomycin resistance is caused by the production of depsipeptide d-ala-d-lac, which replaces d-ala-d-ala in the peptidoglycan pathway, thereby preventing the binding of vancomycin to d-ala-d-ala in the peptidoglycan cell wall. the vana gene is associated with a transpositional element (tn1546) that can be transferred via conjugation while most data suggest that vanb has an endogenous origin. education, aggressive infection control practices. surveillance programs, and appropriate use of vancomycin are necessary to respond to the vre problem. conclusions: the prevalence of vre has increased significantly in recent years and has become a worldwide problem. several factors, such as prior exposure to vancomycin and antibotics (e.g., cephalosporins, antianaerobic agents), physical  location in the hospital, immunosuppression, prolonged hospital stay, and vre gastrointestinal colonization are associated with vre infection and colonization. antibiotic treatment of serious vre infection depends on the phenotype. optimal treatment of the vana phenotype is unknown; the vanb phenotype may be treated with teicoplanin and an aminoglycoside.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == cloning and genetic organization of the bacteriocin 31 determinant encoded on the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pyi17.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pyi17 (57.5 kb) isolated from enterococcus faecalis yi717 confers a pheromone response on the host and encodes the bacteriocin 31 gene. bacteriocin 31 is active against e. hirae 9790, e. faecium, and listeria monocytogenes. pyi17 was mapped physically by restriction enzyme analysis and the relational clone method. deletion mutant and sequence analyses of the ecori fragment b cloned from pyl17 revealed that a 1.0-kb fragment contained the bacteriocin gene (baca) and an immunity gene (bacb). this fragment induced bacteriocin activity in e. faecalis og1x and e. hirae 9790. the baca gene is located on the pyi17 physical map between 3.37 and 3.57 kb, and bacb is located between 3.59 kb and 3.87 kb, baca encodes 67 amino acids, and bacb encodes 94 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence of the baca protein contained a series of hydrophobic residues typical of a signal sequence at its amino terminus. the predicted mature baca protein (43 amino acids) showed sequence homology with the membrane-active class ii bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria.  analysis of tn5 insertion mutants and the resulting transcripts indicated that these genes are transcribed as an operon composed of baca, bacb, and an open reading frame located downstream of bacb designated orf3.

TI  == mobilization of vancomycin resistance by transposon-mediated fusion of a vana plasmid with an enterococcus faecium sex pheromone-response plasmid.
AB  == a striking feature of recent outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant (vmr) enterococci  is the apparent horizontal dissemination of resistance determinants. the plasmids phkk702 and phkk703 from enterococcus faecium clinical isolate r7 have been implicated in the conjugal transfer of vmr. phkk702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the glycopeptide-resistance transposon tn1546. phkk703 is an approx. 55-kb putative sex pheromone-response plasmid that  is required for conjugative mobilization of phkk702. during experiments in which  strain r7 was used as a donor, a highly conjugative vmr transconjugant was isolated that formed constitutive cellular aggregates. restriction analyses and dna hybridizations revealed that the transconjugant harbored a single plasmid of  approx. 92 kb and this plasmid (phkk701) was composed of dna from both phkk702 and phkk703. results from dna sequence analyses showed that a 39-kb composite transposon (tn5506) from phkk702 had inserted into phkk703. the left end of tn5506 contained a single insertion sequence (is) element, is1216v2, whereas the  right end was composed of a tandem is structure consisting of the novel 1065-bp is1252 nested within an is1216v1 element. transposition of tn5506 from phkk702 to phkk703 created an 8-bp target sequence duplication at the site of insertion and  interrupted an orf (orfx) that was 91% identical to that of prgx, a gene proposed to negatively regulate sex pheromone response of the e.faecalis plasmid, pcf10. we propose that the interruption of orfx by tn5506 led to the constitutive cellular aggregation phenotype and thereby enhanced the efficiency with which vmr was transferred. similar is1216v-mediated transposition events may contribute to  the horizontal spread of glycopeptide resistance among enterococci in nature.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of levofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin against 506 gram-positive bacteria was compared with those of d(-)-ofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. levofloxacin was generally twice as active as ofloxacin against these organisms (range, 0-3 twofold dilutions). sparfloxacin appeared to have the greatest activity overall, but for several groups of organisms minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90s) of this compound were within one twofold dilution of those of levofloxacin. resistance to levofloxacin (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml) was not encountered among streptococcal species, was rare in methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (1.7%), and was infrequent in vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (8.7%). resistance was more common among vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

TI  == direct application of etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  == the etest was applied directly to 100 gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). results showed  100% concordance of mic data between a direct etest method and the standard etest method for streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. in addition, direct etest for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard etests. these data indicate that the  etest is useful to obtain mic data on gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. the advantages of a direct etest are two fold: mic results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.

TI  == control of endemic glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the epidemiology of, and control measures for, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in a renal unit. design: a 3-month, prospective, prevalence culture survey of patients on a 24-bed renal unit. setting: a 975-bed community teaching hospital. patients: patients admitted to the renal unit over a 3-month period. patients identified with vre were each matched with four patients without vre isolated over the study period. interventions/control measures: resistant-organism barrier precautions. to eradicate carriage of vre, two patients with vre stool colonization were treated  with 5 days of oral doxycycline (100 mg twice per day) and rifampin (300 mg/day). results: seven patients with vre (8 isolates) were identified. five isolates were enterococcus faecium (vancomycin mic = 16 to 256 micrograms/ml), two were enterococcus faecalis (mics = 16 and 124 micrograms/ml), and one was enterococcus gallinarum (mic = 8.0 micrograms/ml). eradication of carriage with vre was accomplished in two patients treated with doxycycline and rifampin. in the final  30 days of the culture survey and at 9 months, there were no further patients with vre identified. conclusions: resistant-organism precautions and elimination  of patient carriage may be useful measures for controlling the spread of low-prevalence endemic vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

AB  == strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged and spread widely  throughout the united states during the last few years. multiply-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium are especially troublesome because they are often resistant to all commercially available antimicrobial agents. at present, vre infections occur most often in hospitalized patients with severe underlying disease who have undergone invasive procedures and received prolonged courses of  broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. because therapeutic options are limited, prevention of spread from patients with known cases to other vulnerable patients  is essential.

TI  == relevance and risk factors of enterococcal bacteremia following liver transplantation.
AB  == to analyze the clinical characteristics of and identify specific risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia following liver transplantation, we performed a study in  405 consecutive liver transplantation recipients prophylaxed with a selective bowel decontamination regimen. seventy enterococcal bacteremias in 52 patients were identified. enterococcus faecalis (50) outnumbered enterococcus faecium isolates (18), and 49% of enterococcal bacteremias were polymicrobial. biliary tree complications were present in 34% of enterococcal bacteremias. of the 15 deaths (29%) among the patients with enterococcal bacteremia, 4 were directly associated with enterococcal bacteremia. in a multivariate analysis, roux-en-y choledochojejunostomy (p=0.005), a cytomegalovirus-seropositive donor (p=0.013),  prolonged transplantation time (p=0.02), and biliary stricturing (p=0.016) were identified as significant risk factors. other risk factors identified in a univariate analysis included primary sclerosing cholangitis (p=0.009) and symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection (p=0.008). enterococcal bacteremia is a frequent infectious complication in liver transplantation recipients receiving selective bowel decontamination. its association with cytomegalovirus and biliary tree abnormalities suggest specific areas for prophylactic intervention.

AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.

TI  == factors influencing the vitek gram-positive susceptibility system's detection of  vanb-encoded vancomycin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == studies were conducted to identify factors contributing to the inability of the vitek gram-positive susceptibility system (gps; biomerieux, vitek, inc., hazelwood, mo.) to reliably detect vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance among enterococci. to some extent the accuracy of the gps depended on a particular strain's level of resistance, as all isolates for which vancomycin mics were > or = 128 mu g/ml were readily detected but detection of resistance expressed by several strains for which mics were < or = 64 mu g/ml was sporadic. factors besides the level of resistance were studied in two vanb strains. for one strain  (enterococcus faecium u8304), the ability of gps to detect resistance was accurate and consistent, while for the other (enterococcus faecalis v583), gps results were inconsistent and unreliable. using these isolates, we established that growth medium had the most notable effect on the detection of resistance. in the absence of vancomycin, vitek gps broth supported growth comparable to that obtained with brain heart infusion broth for both e. faecium u8304 and e. faecalis v583. however, in the presence of vancomycin the growth patterns changed dramatically so that neither vanb strain grew well in vitek broth, and growth of  v583 was barely detectable after 8 h of incubation. in contrast, good growth of both strains was observed in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with vancomycin. additionally, the same medium effect was observed with other inducibly resistant vanb strains. in conclusion, although vitek broth can support good enterococcal growth, this medium does not sufficiently support expression of vancomycin resistance by certain strains to allow them to be detected by the vitek automated system. furthermore, this observation establishes that the type of growth medium used can substantially influence the expression of vancomycin resistance and indicates that medium-based strategies should be explored for the  enhancement of resistance detection among commercial systems.

TI  == modification of penicillin-binding protein 5 associated with high-level ampicillin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == high-level ampicillin resistance in enterococcus faecium has been shown to be associated with the synthesis of a modified penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp 5)  which had apparently lost its penicillin-binding capability (r. fontana, m. aldegheri, m. ligozzi, h. lopez, a. sucari, and g. satta. antimicrob. agents chemother. 38:1980-1983, 1994). the pbp5 gene of the highly resistant strain e. faecium 9439 was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence showed 77  and 54% homologies with the pbps 5 of enterococcus hirae and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. a gene fragment coding for the c-terminal part of pbp 5 containing the penicillin-binding domain was also cloned from several e. faecium  strains with different levels of ampicillin resistance. sequence comparison revealed a few point mutations, some of which resulted in amino acid substitutions between sdn and ktg motifs in pbps 5 of highly resistant strains. one of these converted a polar residue (the t residue at position 562 or 574) of  pbp 5 produced by susceptible and moderately resistant strains into a nonpolar one (a or i). this alteration could be responsible for the altered phenotype of pbp 5 in highly resistant strains.

TI  == [enterococci; increase in infection rate and antibiotic resistance].
AB  == enterococci (mainly enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium) are increasingly isolated as causative agents of infections, notably in hospitalised patients. most infections are urinary tract infections, septicaemia and endocarditis. dutch figures indicate that 10.8% of all bacteria isolated in seven regional microbiological laboratories were enterococci; the samples came not only from hospital infections. of the isolates 34% were from faecal samples, 14% from urinary tract samples and 14% from genital organ samples. antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem. enterococci are moderately resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat gram positive infections. the infections may be treated with (high dose) penicillin and (or) in combination with an aminoglycoside or with a glycopeptide. unrestricted use of antibiotics increases the risk of resistance. recently enterococci have been isolated which are resistant to ampicillin, gentamycin and vancomycin: such infections are virtually untreatable.

TI  == [gram-positive, catalase negative cocci isolated from clinical material--identification and drug sensitivity of strains].
AB  == 4608 clinical specimens (including 1641 samples of blood) for bacteriological examination were obtained from patients hospitalized in different wards of national clinical hospital no 1 in warsaw. strains were cultured, identified and  their sensitivity to antibacterial drugs was determined during 14 months with the use of semi-automated api (atb-plus) system (biomerieux, france). strains of gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were separated from all cultured strains.  they belonged to the genera: streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, aerococcus and lactococcus (538 strains altogether). 238 streptococcus spp. strains (44.2%) and  201 enterococcus spp. strains (37.4%)were isolated from all specimens. the greatest number of catalase-negative cocci was obtained from wound smears -420 strains, which amounts to 78.2% of all strains. among isolates dominated e. faecalis strains -104 (19.3%) and e. faecium strains - 70 (13.0% of all isolated  strains). vancomycin was the most effective antibacterial drug against gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from patients hospitalized in our hospital. vancomycin-resistant strains constituted from 3% to 18% of strains depending on a species.

TI  == [identification of enterococcus species from clinical samples and their antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == the genus enterococcus has 12 species of which, e faecalis and e faecium are most important in human infections. a progressive resistance to penicillin and ampicillin has been detected in these species. the aim of this work was to identify enterococcus species isolated in a hospital and to study their antimicrobial susceptibility. we studied 209 enterococcus species coming from patients admitted to a public hospital. their susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, imipenem, vancomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin was determined with the agar dilution technique. eighty seven percent of species were e faecalis and 7.1% were e fecium, other isolated species were e hirae, e casseliflaws, e avium, e solitarius and e faecalis variant. thirty eight percent of these species were isolated from the urinary tract, 22% from the skin and 14% from surgical wounds. all e faecalis species were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, imipenem and vancomycin; 27.3% were susceptible to tetracycline, 54.7% to chloramphenicol and 80% to ciprofloxacin. seventy three percent of e faecium species were susceptible to penicillin, 80% to ampicillin and 60% to imipenem. sixty two percent of e faecalis and 42.4% of e faecium were resistant to streptomycin. it is concluded that the correct identification of enterococcus species has therapeutic implications.

TI  == high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci: in vitro activity of double and triple combinations of antimicrobial drugs.
AB  == the ability of double and triple combinations of antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action, such as teicoplanin, meropenem, gentamicin and sparfloxacin, to achieve synergisms was investigated in vitro on some moderate-level gentamicin-resistant (mlgr: 8 < or = mic < or = 256 mg/l) and high-level gentamicin-resistant (hlgr: mic > 500 mg/l) enterococci. on mlgr strains, a constant synergistic effect was achieved by a combination of teicoplanin with gentamicin or with meropenem, while generally addition, sometimes close to synergism, was exhibited by gentamicin-meropenem, gentamicin-sparfloxacin and teicoplanin-sparfloxacin associations. triple combinations of teicoplanin, meropenem and gentamicin, or teicoplanin, sparfloxacin and gentamicin, always showed a remarkable advantage in terms of synergism over double combinations. on hlgr enterococci, the only double association showing an additive effect, sometimes close to synergism, was teicoplanin plus meropenem, while the triple combination of teicoplanin with gentamicin and meropenem always showed a marked synergistic effect. an effect very close to synergism was also shown by the combination of teicoplanin with sparfloxacin and gentamicin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro conjugative transfer of vana vancomycin resistance between enterococci and listeriae of different species.
AB  == in a study designed to gain data on the in vitro transferability of vancomycin resistance from enterococci of the vana phenotype to listeriae of different species, three clinical enterococcus isolates-enterococcus faecium ls10, enterococcus faecalis ls4, and enterococcus faecalis a3208, all harboring a plasmid that strongly hybridized with a vana probe-were used as donors in transfer experiments. strains of five listeria species were used as recipients. from enterococcus faecium ls10, glycopeptide resistance was transferred to listeria monocytogenes, listeria ivanovii, and listeria welshimeri recipients, whereas no transfer occurred to listeria seeligeri or listeria innocua strains. from the two enterococcus faecalis isolates, no transfer occurred to any listeria recipient. mics of both vancomycin and teicoplanin were > or = 256 mg/l for all transconjugants tested. furthermore, all transconjugants harbored a plasmid that  strongly hybridized with the vana probe, with vana consistently located in an ecori fragment of about 4 kb. exposure of listeria transconjugants to vancomycin  resulted in synthesis of a membrane protein similar in size (39 kda) to a vancomycin-induced membrane protein of enterococcus faecium ls10. in retransfer experiments with listeria transconjugants used as donors, glycopeptide resistance was transferred to all listeria recipients tested, including strains of listeria  innocua and listeria seeligeri, which were unable to receive the resistance from  enterococcus faecium ls10. the frequency of vana transfer to listerial recipients was greater in retransfer experiments than in the primary matings. these findings suggest that the vana resistance determinant might spread to the established pathogen listeria monocytogenes, both directly from a resistant enterococcus and  through strains of nonpathogenic listeria species acting as intermediate resistance vehicles.

AB  == aim: to improve the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis by diagnosing cases due to streptococci and enterococci. methods: serum samples were immunoblotted against extracts of the commonest streptococci and enterococci. they were selected from patients with a cardiac murmur, persistent pyrexia and at least three negative blood cultures. the presence of patterns of endocarditis species specific antigenic bands was measured and correlated with clinical outcome. results: negative serology was found in 28 patients where the diagnosis  of endocarditis was rejected or, if proved, staphylococcal, yeast, gram negative, systemic lupus erythematosus, due to q fever or chlamydia psittaci or nonbacterial thrombotic. positive serology was found in 27 of the 34 patients where the response to antibiotics suggested streptococcal or enterococcal infection. in 22 of these there was objective evidence of endocarditis. positive  serology was also found in three of four further patients with vegetations at necropsy. conclusion: the identification of patterns of antibody response on immunoblotting can be used to make a specific diagnosis of streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum  on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.

AB  == two hundred and ten strains of enterococci showing resistance to gentamicin (10 micrograms/disc) were tested for high level resistance by detecting the minimum inhibitory concentration and by using high content disc diffusion test. only 67 per cent of these had high level resistance to gentamicin. high level kanamycin resistance in the group was 84 per cent, while high level streptomycin resistance was 61 per cent. only 85 of the 140 strains with high level gentamicin resistance had similar streptomycin resistance. results using locally made high content discs, correlated 100 per cent with mic results. high level resistance to enterococci should be reported on a routine basis, especially when isolated from  patients with serious infections.

TI  == identification of chromosomal mobile element conferring high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium that contains a chromosomally encoded  vana gene cluster, tn1546::is1251, transferred vancomycin resistance to the plasmid-free strain enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 during filter matings. hybridization of a vanhaxy probe to smai restriction-digested genomic dna separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that the vana gene cluster was located on a 40-kb fragment in the original donor strain and on fragments of  different sizes (150 to 450 kb) in the transconjugants. no hybridization to vana  gene cluster probes was obtained with plasmid dna preparations from the donor or  transconjugants. these results suggested that in each case, the van genes had integrated into the recipient chromosome. the transconjugants in turn could act as donors of vancomycin resistance, and resistance was transferable to a rec- recipient. the results of restriction analyses and dna hybridizations of genomic  dna from the donor and transconjugants were consistent with the transfer of a mobile element that includes the 12.3-kb tn1546::is1251 gene cluster and at least 13 kb of additional dna. this element has been tentatively designated tn5482. dna sequence analysis of a fragment predicted to contain the left end of tn5482 revealed two insertion sequence-like elements: is1216v and an apparently truncated is3-like element. restriction mapping and dna hybridization patterns of the van gene clusters of three additional clinical isolates from new york city showed an element similar to tn5482. transfer of tn5482 and related elements may  be involved in dissemination of vancomycin resistance.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients.
AB  == a point prevalence culture survey was carried out to investigate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among patients admitted to an 800-bed general hospital where no vre had been isolated previously. twenty-two of 636 patients (3.5%) were found to be vre carriers. eighteen strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, three were identified as enterococcus gallinarum, and one was identified as enterococcus faecalis. the  susceptibilities of the enterococci to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin were determined by the disk diffusion and the agar dilution methods. high-level resistance (hlr) to gentamicin and streptomycin was determined by the agar screening method. eighteen strains (82%) were highly resistant to vancomycin, and four strains (18%) were moderately resistant to vancomycin. five strains were susceptible to teicoplanin (23%; mics, < or = 8 micrograms/ml). only one strain (4.5%, e. faecium) showed hlr to gentamicin, and six strains (27%) showed hlr to  streptomycin (one e. faecalis and five e. faecium strains). all 18 e. faecium and 1 e. faecalis strain carried the vana gene, and 3 e. gallinarum strains carried the vanc gene. an epidemiological investigation revealed several risk factors for vre colonization: hospitalization and duration of stay in the hematology department and prior vancomycin treatment. the study demonstrates that the patient's gastrointestinal tract is a possible reservoir for vre, even in hospitals where vre infections have not yet been observed. therefore, we conclude that infection control precautions and restriction of glycopeptide usage may be key issues in limiting the emergence and spread of nosocomial vre infections.

TI  == species identification and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients.
AB  == over a 4-month period, a total of 315 enterococci were isolated from various clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. by applying an array of biochemical  tests, all strains were accurately identified to the species level, and their susceptibilities to clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by a standardized agar dilution technique. e. faecalis and e. faecium accounted for 87.3% and 9.2% of isolates, respectively. e. avium (1%), e. gallinarum (1%), e. durans (0.6%), e. hirae (0.6%), and e. casseliflavus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. eleven strains of e. faecium and 1 e. hirae isolate were resistant to ampicillin, but none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. twenty-three e. faecium and 3 e. faecalis strains as well as 1 e. hirae isolate revealed imipenem resistance. a total of 25.4% enterococci (60 e. faecalis and 19 e. faecium isolates, 1 e. hirae strain) were erythromycin-resistant. twelve strains (11 e. faecium and 1 e. avium) exhibited ciprofloxacin resistance. high-level resistance to streptomycin was found in 58 (21.1%) e. faecalis, 9 (31%) e. faecium, and both e. hirae strains, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) was exclusively seen in the species e. faecalis (11.6% of isolates belonging to this species). a  simple agar screening test containing 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml proved  to be highly reliable for detection of hlgr. the structural gene coding for hlgr  was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction in all isolates showing this resistance trait. moreover, the gene was specifically detected by a  nonradioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe in colony blot hybridization assays, indicating the potential application of these molecular approaches as a diagnostic tool.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  == plasmid-mediated vanb glycopeptide resistance in enterococci.
AB  == enterococcus faecium, which was highly resistant to vancomycin (mic 256 mg/liter), but susceptible to teicoplanin (mic 2 mg/liter), caused two distinct episodes of infection on a renal unit in the united kingdom. pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) indicated that a single strain caused the first episode, while the second episode, which occurred 1 year later, involved multiple strains, all of which were distinct from the original strain. vancomycin resistance in all but one of these strains was mediated by transferable plasmids that carried the vanb glycopeptide resistance gene. transfer either of resistance plasmids or the  vanb resistance determinant itself to different strains occurred during the second episode. plasmid-mediated vanb resistance has not been widely documented.  a retrospective study of a reference collection revealed two other vanb-encoding  plasmids from an e. faecalis and an e. faecium referred from two further uk centers. although restriction analysis indicated no similarity between the plasmids from the three different centers, all contained a 2.1-kb ecorv fragment  that hybridized with a probe for the vanb gene. this suggests that there has been dissemination of a conserved glycopeptide resistance determinant, of which vanb is a part.

AB  == objective: to determine the recovery of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) on fingertips, gloved fingertips, and environmental surfaces commonly encountered in the healthcare setting, and to examine the importance of handwashing on the removal of these organisms. design: two clinical isolates of vre (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) were inoculated onto the hands of healthy human volunteers and the following environmental surfaces: countertops, bedrails, telephones, and stethoscopes. following inoculation, samples were obtained at various time intervals to determine rates of recovery of organisms. to evaluate the effects of handwashing on enterococcal recovery, two different soap preparations were tested. hands were washed with water alone or with one of the soaps and water. the soap and water studies were performed with a 5-second and a  30-second wash. results: both enterococcal strains survived for at least 60 minutes on gloved and ungloved fingertips. the e faecalis was recoverable from countertops for 5 days; the e faecium persisted for 7 days. for bedrails, both enterococcal species survived for 24 hours without significant reduction in colony counts. the bacteria persisted for 60 minutes on the telephone handpiece and for 30 minutes on the diaphragmatic surface of the stethoscope. a 5-second wash with water alone resulted in virtually no change in recovery of enterococci; a 30-second wash with water plus either soap was necessary to eradicate the bacteria from hands completely. conclusion: vre are capable of prolonged survival on hands, gloves, and environmental surfaces. hands should be washed thoroughly and gloves removed following contact with patients infected or colonized with these multidrug-resistant bacteria. finally, environmental surfaces may serve as  potential reservoirs for nosocomial transmission of vre and need to be considered when formulating institutional infection control policies.

AB  == background: the incidence of enterococci infection is on the rise. treatment is ever more difficult due to the intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobial and their ability to acquire new resistance. the aim of this study was to: a) determine the antibiotic sensitivity of 80 enterococci strains isolated from blood in 1989-1993 and, b) detect the possible changes in the resistance patterns over this period. methods: eighty enterococci strains isolated from blood cultures, since 1989 to 1993 were studied. sixty-nine were enterococcus faecalis  and 11 enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 11 antimicrobial was determined by the agar dilution method. the mantel-haenszel and fisher tests were used for statistical analysis of the results. results: all the  strains were sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. a high level of resistance (hlr) to gentamycin and streptomycin was observed in 18.7% and 23.7%, respectively of the strains. fourteen strains (17.7%) presented hlr to both antibiotics. approximately one third of the strains were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested. analysis of the results by year only demonstrated a significant lineal trend of resistance for ofloxacin (p = 0.014) and a significant difference between the years for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.017). strains with an mic > or = 16 mg/l of fluoroquinolones presented hlr to gentamycin (p < 0.001) and to all the aminoglucosides (p < 0.001). conclusions: the incidence of  antibiotic resistance of enterococci isolated from blood in the authors hospital  is generally low and, with the exception of the fluoroquinolones, did not demonstrate any significant differences during the period studied. periodic updating and analysis of sensitivity results are required to monitor any changes  which may occur over time.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial wy-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. wy-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. most strains of enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of a vancomycin resistance plasmid by a putative enterococcus faecium sex pheromone response plasmid.
AB  == recent epidemiological evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an  important mechanism for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. a filter mating survey of 21 vana enterococcus faecium isolates from the new york hospital showed that 14 of these isolates transferred vancomycin resistance (vmr) to the plasmid-free reference strain enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. one isolate, e. faecium r7, was selected for further study based on its ability to transfer vmr to strain jh2-2 in liquid culture. analysis of the plasmid content of transconjugants revealed three general classes. the predominant class (28 of 47 transconjugants) contained two separate plasmids: phkk702 and phkk703. phkk702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the vmr transposon tn1546 and an element that hybridizes with an ermb probe from the staphylococcus aureus erythromycin resistance transposon tn551. phkk703 is a 55-kb plasmid that hybridizes with probes for the sex pheromone response genes prga, prgb, and prgx derived from the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10. the second group of transconjugants (18 of 47) contained various recombinant forms of phkk702 and  phkk703, whereas a third transconjugant class contained only phkk702 (1 of 47). transconjugants that contained both phkk702 and phkk703 were able to efficiently  transfer vmr to recipient strains in broth or on filters. however, no transfer of vmr was detected using the donor containing only phkk702. the transfer of vmr from the recombination-deficient derivative of e. faecalis jh2-2 [strain uv202(phkk702, phkk703)] was reduced 600-fold compared to that of jh2-2(phkk702,  phkk703). we propose that phkk703 functions as an e. faecium sex pheromone response plasmid that conjugatively mobilizes phkk702, and that a major pathway for this mobilization may require donor-mediated recombination proficiency. this  report provides the first example in which a plasmid containing a tn1546-related  element is conjugatively mobilized.

TI  == nosocomial enterococci: resistance to heat and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == six strains each of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were investigated with respect to their resistance to heat and sodium hypochlorite. all enterococci survived the temperatures and holding times specified by the department of health (doh) for the disinfection of 'foul and used' or 'infected' linen (65 degrees c for 10 min or 71 degrees c for 3 min). in addition, three strains (one e. faecium and two e. faecalis) could withstand 150 ppm available chlorine for 5 min, the treatment suggested by the doh for the disinfection of heat labile materials. further, our results showed that four strains of e. faecium were able to survive  the british standard for heat disinfection of bedpans (80 degrees c for 1 min). the significance of these findings with particular reference to the potential for enterococci to survive and disseminate in the hospital environment is discussed.

TI  == comparison of pigment production and motility tests with pcr for reliable identification of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == forty-eight clinical isolates identified as either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis with the microscan system (dade international, microscan inc., west sacramento, calif.) were further characterized by two supplementary biochemical tests (pigment production and motility). twenty isolates (42%), all initially identified as e. faecium, were motile. of these 20, 8 isolates (17%) produced yellow pigment and were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus and the remaining 12 (25%) were nonpigmented and were identified as enterococcus gallinarum. identical identification results were obtained when pcr amplification of regions of the vanc gene was used as a technique for differentiating these organisms. the results of this study indicate that motility and pigment production tests together with commercial test systems are sufficient for reliable identifications of e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum.

TI  == the challenge of vancomycin-resistant enterococci: a clinical and epidemiologic study.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been recovered with increasing  frequency from hospitalized patients. risk factors, mode of nosocomial transmission, extent of colonization in hospitalized patients, and treatment options for these organisms have not been completely delineated. methods: we studied 53 patients (group a) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from various clinical specimens and also surveyed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in stool specimens submitted for clostridium difficile toxin assays (group b). stool specimens submitted for identification of bacterial pathogens and stool specimens from hospital employees were also analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. results: seventy-six isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in group a. five of these patients harbored vancomycin-resistant enterococci on admission. fifty-three of 289 group b stool specimens submitted for c. difficile toxin assays yielded vancomycin-resistant enterococci. cephalosporins and vancomycin were the most common antimicrobial agents received  by both groups of patients. enterococcus faecium isolates were more resistant than enterococcus faecalis isolates to antimicrobial agents. all isolates exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance and were not beta-lactamase producers. there were at least 15 different molecular clones of e. faecium and three of e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a 100% in-hospital mortality rate. conclusions: multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens that  are difficult to treat. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a poor prognosis. we found a high rate of colonization in patients with suspected c. difficile toxin colitis. judicious use of vancomycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and strict infection control measures must be implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission of these organisms.

TI  == investigation of the reformulated remel synergy quad plate for detection of high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == we investigated the accuracy of the recently released remel synergy quad plate, a commercially available agar screening method for detecting high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci that is based on the national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended guidelines (national committee for clinical laboratory standards, m7-a3, 1993). the synergy  quad correctly determined the gentamicin and streptomycin resistance status for > or = 97% of 147 enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates tested. detection of vancomycin resistance also was reliable, as no false susceptibility  occurred with 36 vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium strains and false resistance occurred only once with the 47 susceptible strains tested. one strain each of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus failed to grow on the screen, but because the true nature and significance of resistance in such isolates is unknown the implication of their screen negativity is uncertain. in summary, the remel synergy quad provides a highly accurate and convenient method for susceptibility testing of enterococci against gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin.

TI  == correlation between phenotypic characteristics and dna relatedness within enterococcus faecium strains.
AB  == we noted that a number of enterococcal strains isolated from human clinical specimens resembled enterococcus faecium but were able to produce acid from glycerol, raffinose, and/or sorbitol, while others failed to form acid from mannitol. an additional concern was that many of these strains with atypical phenotypic characteristics also appeared to acquire vancomycin resistance. in order to determine if such atypical strains were variants of e. faecium or new enterococcus species, 35 e. faecium or e. faecium-like strains (grouped into 10 phenotypes on the basis of the results of the following tests: capacity to form acid from glycerol, mannitol, raffinose, or sorbitol and susceptibility to vancomycin) and four strains of enterococcus faecalis were taken from our culture collection, analyzed for their whole-cell protein profiles by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identified to the species level by dna-dna reassociation experiments. all e. faecium-like strains, including four mannitol-negative variants, conformed to at least two of three dna-dna relatedness criteria: they were 70% or more related to the type strain of e. faecium at optimal conditions, they had less than 5% divergence within the related sequences, and they had a relatedness of 60% or greater under stringent conditions. the protein profiles of atypical strains were similar to those of typical strains and were easily distinguishable from those of e. faecalis and other enterococcal species. the five e. faecalis strains were 12 to 16% related to the e. faecium type strain. these results indicate that the phenotypic description of e. faecium should include all of these variable characteristics.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci strains].
AB  == enterococci resistance to antimicrobials has increased lately. we studied the susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials of 150 enterococci strains coming from hospitalized and outpatients, using the agar dilution method. teicoplanin, followed by imipenem and amoxicilin-clavulanic acid had the lower minimal inhibitory concentrations. no strains of e faecalis was resistant to ampicillin,  whereas 14% of e faecium had minimal inhibitory concentrations over 8 micrograms/ml. the high minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefpirome (64 micrograms/ml) renders this antimicrobial useless in the treatment of enterococcal infections. betalactamase production and resistance to glucopeptides were not detected. antimicrobial susceptibility of strains coming for hospitalized or outpatients were similar.

AB  == mics of amoxicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid were determined against 52 clinical strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium. modal mics (mg/l) of these antibiotics were 1, 4, 64 and 64, respectively. bactericidal activity of the beta-lactams was tested at two concentrations (1/2 mic and 100 mg/l) alone or combined with gentamicin (4 mg/l)  against 10 clinical strains of enterococcus spp. activity of ticarcillin was not  modified by the addition of clavulanic acid (4 mg/l). time-kill curves showed that all beta-lactams at 100 mg/l were bactericidal after 18 h of incubation (decrease in bacterial counts > or = 3 log10 cfu/ml) against 6 strains of e. faecalis, with mics of amoxicillin at 1 mg/l and 2 strains of e. faecium with mics of amoxicillin at 1 and 2 mg/l. addition of gentamicin resulted in a bactericidal effect at 3 or 6 hours for the great majority of the combinations studied, except against the two strains highly resistant to gentamicin. combination of every beta-lactam at 1/2 mic with gentamicin was synergistic (except in case of high level resistance to gentamicin) and prevented bacterial growth but was not bactericidal. against two strains of e. faecium with high mics of amoxicillin (8 mg/l), piperacillin-tazobactam (64 mg/l) and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (512 mg/l), only combinations of amoxicillin 100 mg/l and gentamicin were always bactericidal. in conclusion, against e. faecalis strains, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid tested at 100 micrograms/ml had a bactericidal activity similar to that of the other beta-lactams tested, alone or  combined with gentamicin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the bi-functional enzyme 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac-6')-2" aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph-2"), which is encoded by the 2 kb fused gene aaca-aphd, mediates gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis. this gene is associated with the composite transposon tn5281 that shares extensive homology with transposons tn4001 and tn4031 found in staphylococci. typically these transposons are characterized by the resistance gene being flanked by 1.35  kb insertion sequences (is256). the resistance gene (aaca-aphd) appears identical among all e. faecalis studied, but restriction enzyme analysis indicates notable  heterogeneity within the flanking regions. various combinations of is256-like and is257-like elements, or portions thereof, have been described in different resistant isolates. as gentamicin resistance has been described in other enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, e. casseliflavus) homology with the resistance gene of e. faecalis has largely been  maintained, but more extensive variations in the flanking sequences have been noted. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gentamicin resistance  determinants, heterogeneity in the flanking regions indicates that measurable divergence exists among these determinants. this divergence may be of value in characterizing the mechanisms and natural course of gentamicin resistance dissemination which now includes staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci.

AB  == nosocomial enterococcal infections are increasing. in order to establish the species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci in clinical specimens from hospitalized patients, we undertook a survey of 23 irish  hospitals. one thousand and five viable enterococcal strains were studied. nine different species of enterococci were identified, including enterococcus faecalis (84%); enterococcus faecium (9%); and enterococcus hirae (3%). the most common sites of isolation were the urinary tract (66%), wound and soft tissues (23%) and blood stream (3%). many of the isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant. ampicillin resistance was detected in 16%. neither beta-lactamase production, nor high level penicillin resistance was detected. high level gentamicin resistance was evident in 7% of isolates and varied among species, e.g. 4% e. faecalis, 24%  e. faecium, and 34% e. hirae. a number of isolates (23%) were also highly resistant to streptomycin. no clinically significant glycopeptide resistance was  detected. the species distribution and incidence of multiple resistance was geographically widespread. this emphasizes the need for detailed speciation and in-vitro susceptibility testing along with the evaluation of alternative combination chemotherapeutic regimens for the management of serious enterococcal  infection.

TI  == detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species  level of clinically relevant enterococci by pcr.
AB  == a pcr assay that allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species level of clinically relevant enterococci (enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) was developed. this assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases and related glycopeptide resistance proteins. the specificity of the assay was tested on 5 well-characterized glycopeptide-resistant strains and on 15 susceptible enterococcal type strains. clinical isolates of enterococci that could not be identified to the species level by conventional methods were identified by the pcr test. this assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance.

TI  == dna hybridization and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis  for identification of enterococci to the species level.
AB  == in this study, 113 enterococcus faecium, 37 enterococcus faecalis, 24 enterococcus gallinarum, 15 enterococcus raffinosus, and 13 enterococcus casseliflavus clinical isolates and american type culture collection (atcc) strains were evaluated by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis. thirty-one of the e. faecium, 22 of the e. faecalis, 24 of the e. gallinarum, 15 of the e. raffinosus, and 13 of the e. casseliflavus isolates were also evaluated by dna-dna hybridization. genomic dnas from type strains e. faecalis atcc 19433, e. faecium atcc 19434, e. gallinarum atcc 49573, e. raffinosus atcc 49427, and e. casseliflavus atcc 25788 were labeled with biotin for use as probes. e. faecalis differed from all other species in always having a largest fragment of > 400 kb. e. gallinarum was different from all other species  in having all smai fragments of < 200 kb. biotin-labeled probes showed a high degree of hybridization with genomic dna from the same species and a low degree of hybridization when hybridized to genomic dna from different species for all isolates tested except for four isolates identified as e. faecium by conventional biochemical methods. the dna from these four isolates hybridized strongly to dna  from e. gallinarum atcc 49573 and weakly to e. faecium atcc 19434 dna and had all smai fragments of < 200 kb in size. these data suggest that these isolates are nonmotile e. gallinarum. dna from each atcc type strain hybridized strongly with  itself and had only a low degree of hybridization with dna from other atcc type strains tested. these results suggest that contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis patterns and dna-dna hybridization with biotin-labeled probes may be of use for species differentiation of some enterococci.

TI  == is6770, an enterococcal insertion-like sequence useful for determining the clonal relationship of clinical enterococcal isolates.
AB  == enterococci expressing resistance to antimicrobial agents are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens. effective strategies to prevent or abort outbreaks of resistant enterococcal infection will rely on an accurate understanding of the mechanisms by which these organisms spread. a 1065-bp insertion-like sequence (is6770) is present in varying copy numbers in > 90% of enterococcal strains thus far examined. hybridization patterns resulting from hybridization of enterococcal genomic dna with an internal is6770 probe vary considerably between unrelated strains and correlate well with results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and field-inversion gel electrophoresis in identifying clonal relationships among enterococcal isolates. is6770 analysis of  several outbreaks of resistant enterococci has confirmed the spread of single resistant clones rather than the emergence of resistance within the resident flora. these results suggest that is6770 hybridization will be a useful tool for  tracing the epidemiology of nosocomial enterococcal infections.

TI  == resistance of enterococcus faecium to neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis.
AB  == during a previous study of the opsonic requirements for neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn])-mediated killing of enterococci, we identified two strains of enterococcus faecium (tx0015 and tx0016) that were resistant to pmn-mediated killing. to better define the mechanism of this resistance, we examined phagocytosis with a fluorescence assay and found that tx0016 was completely resistant to phagocytosis by pmns; this finding was confirmed by electron microscopy. examination of multiple strains of enterococci  revealed that all 20 strains of enterococcus faecalis tested were readily phagocytosed (mean, 18 intracellular organisms per pmn; range, 7 to 28). in contrast, only 13 (50%) of 26 strains of e. faecium tested were susceptible to phagocytosis (> or = 7 organisms per pmn); the other 13 strains showed < or = 3 organisms per pmn. enterococcus casseliflavus atcc 25788 and one strain of enterococcus hirae were also resistant to phagocytosis, while two strains of enterococcus durans, enterococcus mundtii atcc 43186, and one strain each of enterococcus raffinosus and enterococcus solitarius were readily phagocytosed. exposure of e. faecium tx0016 to sodium periodate, but not to the protease trypsin or pronase or to phospholipase c, eliminated resistance to phagocytosis.  sialic acid, a common periodate-sensitive structure used by microorganisms to resist opsonization, could not be demonstrated in e. faecium tx0016 by the thiobarbituric acid method, nor was phagocytosis of tx0016 altered by neuraminidase treatment. this study suggests that there is a difference in susceptibility to phagocytosis by pmns between different species of enterococci and that a carbohydrate-containing moiety which is not sialic acid may be involved in the resistance of e. faecium tx0016 to phagocytosis.

TI  == use of cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar for selective isolation of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (caa), a new selective agar, was examined in  comparison with nalidixic acid-colistin agar for the differentiation of enterococcus faecium from other enterococci and the ability to isolate the organism from feces. two hundred sixteen enterococcus isolates and a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative control strains were inoculated onto both media.  all control strains of e. faecium were easily differentiated from enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus durans on the basis of arabinose fermentation on caa. differentiation of e. faecium from other enterococci or streptococcus bovis was not possible on nalidixic acid-colistin agar. increased isolation of e. faecium was demonstrated on caa when both media were compared for the isolation of the organism from feces. caa has been shown to possess excellent differential and selective features allowing the simple and effective isolation of e. faecium from heavily contaminated sites.

TI  == revised estimates of enterococcal chromosomal sizes.
AB  == we previously reported that the chromosomal sizes of four strains of enterococci  ranged from 2,045 to 2,761 kb. extensive analysis and mapping subsequently confirmed the size of enterococcus faecalis strain og1 as 2,825 kb (prior size estimate range, 2,750-2,761 kb) (murray et al., j. bacteriol. 175, 5216, 1993). however, using variable conditions of electrophoresis and additional digestions,  revised size estimates for the other strains are 2,852-3,093 kb for e. faecalis strain jh2-2 (prior range, 2,008-2,135 kb), 2,910-3,065 kb for e. faecalis strain hh67 (prior range, 2,170-2,288 kb), and 2,334-2,558 for e. faecium strain ge-1 (prior range, 2,045-2,155 kb). the earlier underestimations of the chromosomal sizes were due to the inconsistent presence of a large fragment, likely caused by shearing of the dna during handling, causing it to be considered a partial digestion product, and failure to resolve multiple fragments of the same approximate size.

TI  == [enterococcus sp. resistance, a growing problem. epidemiologic study (1987-1993)].
AB  == background: infectious processes caused by enterococcus species currently constitute a growing problem due to the rapid appearance of resistances and the scarce existing therapeutic alternatives. the patterns of in vitro resistance to  ampicillin, vancomycin and gentamycin were therefore studied in addition to their evolution over time of the isolates of enterococcus sp. identified in the salamanca university hospital from 1987-1993. methods: data were obtained from a  computerized system of epidemiologic surveillance of infection in in-patients on  the basis of microbiologic information. sensitivity tests were performed by the disc-plate diffusion method of the national clinical committee for laboratory standards. results: global resistance was 2.1% to vancomycin versus 8.3% to ampicillin with most of the isolates being resistant to gentamycin. the frequency of appearance of resistance increased over time with 19.6% of the strains found to be resistant to ampicillin (p < 0.05; ci 95%, 1987-1988: 12.2-24.3%) in 1993 and from 1991-1992 2.7% were found to be resistant to vancomycin. the strains from patients from the medical area were more resistant to ampicillin (p < 0.05;  ci 95%, 0.8-7.4%) and vancomycin (p < 0.05; ci 95%, 0.2-3.9%) than those corresponding to patients from the surgical area. greater resistance was identified to ampicillin and vancomycin in the isolates from urine and wound exudates. patients under the age of 1 year were significantly less resistant to ampicillin (p < 0.05; ci 95%, with respect to the group from 21 to 40 years: 1.6-13.9%) and vancomycin with the greatest resistance being found from 41 to 60  years of age. e. faecalis (2.9% resistance) was more resistant to vancomycin and  e. faecium was more resistant to ampicillin (27.8% resistant strains) (p < 0.05:  ci 95%, 3.2-33.6%). conclusions: over time there has been a rapid increase in the number of enterococci resistant to ampicillin while, to date, vancomycin shows good activity against these bacteria.

TI  == heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pip964 (inchlyi) of enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  == erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pip964 from enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. this was done by inserting the integrative vector pat112 and the related replicon ptcr1 harboring orir of the broad host range plasmid pam beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pip964, to give ptcr2 and ptcr3, respectively. plasmid ptcr2 was transferred by filter matings from e. faecalis to enterococcus  faecium and listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. in these hosts, ptcr2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. plasmid ptcr3, but not ptcr2, was transferred at similar frequencies from e. faecalis to lactococcus lactis and streptococcus agalactiae. thus, the transfer system of pip964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.

TI  == clinical and molecular epidemiology of enterococcal bacteremia in a pediatric teaching hospital.
AB  == an apparent increase in the incidence of enterococcal bacteremias from 7 to 48/1000 bacteremias during 1986 to 1991 (p < 0.01) prompted this descriptive clinical and molecular epidemiologic study of 83 episodes occurring in 80 children between 1986 and 1992. most community-acquired cases were in infants, in comparison with nosocomial episodes (24/26 and 34/57; p < 0.01); many of them were neonates (10/26 and 6/57; p < 0.01). nosocomial cases were associated with underlying conditions including major surgery 56%, immunosuppression 49%, organ and tissue transplants 30%, and cardiac 32%, pulmonary 25%, renal 21%, and hepatic 21% disorders. nosocomial episodes developed after a median of 32 days. there were 58 primary and 25 secondary bacteremias. thirty-two episodes were polymicrobial and 44 organisms were involved. twenty-six percent of the patients  died. in 15%, death was preceded by septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and polymicrobial bacteremia (p < 0.01). of 75 isolates, 82% were enterococcus faecalis and 14% were enterococcus faecium. fourteen e. faecalis strains produced hemolysin; none produced beta-lactamase. three had high-level resistance to gentamicin and 13 to streptomycin; two e. faecium and none of the e. faecalis strains were vancomycin resistant at a low level (p < 0.01) and one was ampicillin resistant. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of whole-cell dna digested with restriction enzymes sma i and eag i showed five isolates with a homogeneous pattern, two with another homogeneous pattern, and 68 with distinct heterogeneous patterns. the increase in enterococcal bacteremias was not due to a clonal strain dissemination but to an increase in cases of heterogeneous enterococcal strains. we conclude that enterococcal septicemia is now an important cause of serious morbidity and death in critically ill children.

TI  == glycopeptide resistance mediated by enterococcal transposon tn1546 requires production of vanx for hydrolysis of d-alanyl-d-alanine.
AB  == cloning and nucleotide sequencing indicated that transposon tn1546 from enterococcus faecium bm4147 encodes a 23,365 da protein, vanx, required for glycopeptide resistance. the vanx gene was located downstream from genes encoding the vana ligase and the vanh dehydrogenase which synthesize the depsipeptide d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-ala-d-lac). in the presence of ramoplanin, an enterococcus  faecalis jh2-2 derivative producing vanh, vana and vanx accumulated mainly udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lac (pentadepsipeptide) and small amounts of udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala (pentapeptide) in the ratio 49:1. insertional inactivation of vanx led to increased synthesis of pentapeptide with a resulting change in the ratio of pentadepsipeptide: pentapeptide to less than 1:1. expression of vanx in e. faecalis and escherichia  coli resulted in production of a d,d-dipeptidase that hydrolysed d-ala-d-ala. pentadepsipeptide, pentapeptide and d-ala-d-lac were not substrates for the enzyme. these results establish that vanx is required for production of a d,d-dipeptidase that hydrolyses d-ala-d-ala, thereby preventing pentapeptide synthesis and subsequent binding of glycopeptides to d-ala-d-ala-containing peptidoglycan precursors at the cell surface.

TI  == overproduction of a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein and high-level ampicillin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == five ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium were analyzed for a correlation between overproduction of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (pbp 5) and the level of ampicillin resistance. comparison was made with  one susceptible clinical isolate and its ampicillin-resistant derivative obtained in the laboratory by selection with increasing concentrations of penicillin. overproduction of the low-affinity pbp relative to the susceptible isolate was noted in moderately resistant strains (mic, 32 micrograms/ml) but not in highly resistant strains (mic, 128 micrograms/ml). polyclonal antibodies specifically reacting with the low-affinity pbp of enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecalis,  and enterococcus faecium (m. ligozzi, m. aldegheri, s. c. predari, and r. fontana, fems microbiol. lett. 83:335-340, 1991) were used to determine the amount of this pbp in the e. faecium isolates. in all strains, the antibody preparation reacted with a membrane protein of the same molecular mass as pbp 5.  the amount of this protein was very small in the susceptible strain but large in  all of the resistant strains. these results suggest that the highly resistant strains also overproduced the low-affinity pbp, which, compared with pbp 5 of moderately resistant strains, appeared to be modified in its penicillin-binding capability.

AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

AB  == gentamicin resistance in six enterococcal species was investigated. transfer of resistance was observed for the donors e. faecium uc 79, e. avium cc 54, and e. gallinarum b 51, but not for e. raffinosus uc 78 or e. casseliflavus uc 73. except for e. casseliflavus uc 73, homology was observed between the e. faecalis  aac6'-aph2" gene and dna from other species. whereas 2.6-kb hindiii fragments encoded resistance in e. faecalis uc 244, its transconjugant, and e. raffinosus uc 78, 3.4-kb fragments encoded resistance in e. faecium uc 79, e. gallinarum b 51, and their transconjugants. a 3.4-kb fragment encoded resistance in e. avium cc 54, but 2.6-kb fragments encoded resistance in the transconjugants. although many similarities were found among the strains, the heterogeneity in gentamicin resistance exhibited by some isolates indicates diversity among these determinants.

TI  == in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  == the in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, cl 329,998 and cl 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. a total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. members of the family enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference  was seen with proteus spp.). pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 16 micrograms/ml). tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 1  microgram/ml). streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). the glycylcyclines were highly potent against neisseria, moraxella, haemophilus, and bacteroides spp. (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). strains of chlamydia spp. (three c. trachomatis strains and one c. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of cl 329,998 or cl 331,002 per ml. two strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of cl 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of cl 329,998 per ml. mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were resistant to the  two glycylcyclines (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml). these results indicate that the  two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == bactericidal action of gentamicin against enterococci that are sensitive, or exhibit low- or high-level resistance to gentamicin.
AB  == treatment of serious enterococcal infection involves the use of penicillin-aminoglycoside combination therapy if the aminoglycoside minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) is < or = 2000 micrograms/ml, and the organism is  susceptible to penicillin or ampicillin. we evaluated killing of 15 enterococci that differ in their susceptibility to gentamicin using time-kill studies at different gentamicin concentrations. sensitive strains had a uniform population killed by gentamicin concentrations equal to or above the mic. low-level resistant strains (mic > or = 8 but < or = 2000 micrograms/ml of gentamicin) had  a diverse population with large numbers of cells killed at one-half the mic, while the highly resistant strains (mic > 2000 micrograms/ml) showed no killing by any concentration of gentamicin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of du-6859a (du), a new fluoroquinolone agent, was evaluated against 233 gram-positive cocci and was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, nafcillin, and ampicillin. the mics of du for 90% of the staphylococci tested were < or = 0.06 microgram/ml. all of the groups a and b and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.125 microgram of du per ml, which was 32-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. on the basis of mics for 90% of the strains tested, du was 32- and 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. the bactericidal activity of du was demonstrated by time-kill techniques against all ciprofloxacin-susceptible enterococci. du shows promise for the treatment of infections with gram-positive cocci and warrants further evaluation by in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  == bactericidal activities of peptide antibiotics against multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium has emerged as a serious pathogen for which no effective therapy has been established. in this report, we describe the  activities of two peptide antibiotics, ramoplanin and daptomycin, against 15 isolates of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, and aminoglycosides using time-kill experiments. both antibiotics were rapidly bactericidal when tested in broth; however, the addition of 50% serum resulted in significant regrowth. the combination of ampicillin with either ramoplanin or daptomycin largely prevented this regrowth. these peptide antibiotics showed good activity against these pathogens. while the development of daptomycin has been halted, ramoplanin may hold promise for the therapy of multidrug-resistant e. faecium, especially when combined with ampicillin.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei synthesize cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in lactate.
AB  == the emergence of acquired high-level resistance among enterococcus species has renewed interest in mechanisms of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics in gram-positive bacteria. in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, resistance is encoded by the van gene cluster and is due to the production of a peptidoglycan precursor terminating in d-alanyl-d-lactate, to which vancomycin does not bind. most leuconostoc and many lactobacillus species are intrinsically  resistant to high levels of glycopeptide antibiotics, but the mechanism of resistance has not been elucidated. to determine whether the mechanisms of resistance are similar in intrinsically resistant bacteria, cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors were isolated from leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus casei and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing structures consistent with udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-(l-ala)-d-ala-d-lactate and udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, respectively.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of high-level, gentamicin-resistant enterococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == we attempted to characterize the susceptibility of high-level, gentamicin-resistant (hlgr, minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] > 2000 micrograms/ml) enterococcal blood isolates and evaluated a small subset of these  isolates for bactericidal synergy. thirteen enterococcus faecalis and three enterococcus faecium isolates that were hlgr were prospectively collected. standard broth macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations to a variety of antibiotics. two isolates were evaluated for synergy by time-kill curve methods using combinations of penicillin and streptomycin, teicoplanin and rifampin, and vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. teicoplanin was the most active antibiotic tested, with all isolates exhibiting susceptibility to this agent. four e. faecalis isolates and one e. faecium isolate expressed only low-level resistance to streptomycin (llsr, mics 32-64 micrograms/ml). penicillin and streptomycin produced bactericidal synergy in the llsr isolate. the other antibiotic combinations did not result in  bactericidal synergy in the two isolates tested. for hlgr enterococci that are only llsr, the combination of penicillin-streptomycin appears to provide adequate bactericidal activity. teicoplanin may potentially be useful for streptomycin-resistant hlgr isolates.

(b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == enterococcis: pathogens of the 90s.
AB  == the genus enterococcus consists of at least 12 species, two of which account for  over 95% of the clinically important strains, e faecalis (85%-90%) and e faecium  (5%-10%). despite their ubiquity and frequent isolation, they have not been thought to cause serious disease because they lack common virulence factors. now, however, enterococci are regarded as true pathogens and are the second leading cause of nosocomial infections. this change results from their increasing antimicrobial resistance and the extensive use of antimicrobial drugs (for example-cephalosporins) that are not active against them. serious infections should usually be treated with a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside, but glycopeptides have been increasingly used during the last decade. two novel resistance patterns of particular concern recently are high level aminoglycoside  resistance (hlar) and vancomycin resistance. the prevalence of hlar is between 15% and 55%, and glycopeptide resistance has become widespread in various geographical areas. this poses a serious problem, as such resistance may spread to other gram-positive organisms and is often associated with resistance to other antimicrobial drugs. this may theoretically result in groups of organisms for which there will be no effective antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == n,n-dimethylglycylamido (dmg) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. the in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated  in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in north  america. the glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(a), tet(b), tet(c), and tet(d) in escherichia coli and tet(k) in staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(m) in s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and e. coli)] resistance determinants. potent activity (mic for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. the glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. the activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. the in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. the glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(k), and a tetracycline-susceptible e. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(m) or tet(b). levels of dmg-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of dmg-minocycline or minocycline. our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. on the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.

AB  == six strains of enterococci were distributed to participants in the united kingdom national external quality assessment scheme for microbiology with a request that  they be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin/penicillin and vancomycin and for high-level resistance to gentamicin. more than 98% of laboratories correctly reported the resistant strains as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. however, there was a poorer correlation for the susceptible strains, with only 1-6% and 69-83% of laboratories reporting the strains as susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin respectively. those laboratories which used 5-25 micrograms ampicillin discs or breakpoint methods reported proportionally more results correctly for the susceptible strains than those using 2 micrograms discs. participants using escherichia coli or an enterococcus as a control and those not using a control at all were more likely to report ampicillin-susceptible strains correctly than those using staphylococcus aureus nctc 6571 (oxford strain). for vancomycin-susceptible and high-level vancomycin-resistant strains, 93-96% and 96-99% of reports respectively were correct. for the low-level vancomycin-resistant strains, only 50-54% of reports were correct. participants using a 5 micrograms vancomycin disc reported proportionally more of the low-level resistant strains correctly than those using 10, 20, 25, 30 or 100 micrograms discs. participants not using controls were proportionally more likely to report the low-level resistant strains as susceptible than those using an enterococcus or s. aureus nctc 6571 as a control. for the high-level gentamicin-resistant (hlgr) strains, 96-98% of reports were correct. depending on the strain, between 12% and 41% of participants also reported high-level resistance for the strains which were not hlgr. those using low-content discs (< or = 30 micrograms) and breakpoint or mic methods were more  likely to report strains which were not hlgr as hlgr than those using high-content discs. those using an enterococcus as a control were less likely to  report strains which were not hlgr as hlgr than those using either s. aureus nctc 6571 or e. coli as a control and those not using a control.

TI  == prevalence in singapore of enterococci with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and comparison of three methods for their detection.
AB  == the first study of the prevalence in singapore of enterococci with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides has been made in the national university hospital.  from march to june 1992, 225 isolates were studied by means of three methods: (1) use of brain-heart infusion (bhi) agar incorporating the antibiotic; (2) microdilution of the antibiotic in broth; and (3) use of high content antibiotic  discs. the bhi agar was the reference method. of the total, 49 (22%) isolates were resistant to gentamicin, 86 (38%) to streptomycin, 82 (36%) to kanamycin and 93 (41%) to one or more of the agents. results of the disc diffusion method correlated completely with the bhi agar method. the broth microdilution method showed a 100, 90 and 96% sensitivity in relation to gentamicin, streptomycin and  kanamycin, respectively, and a specificity of 100% for all three aminoglycosides. statistical significance (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) was demonstrated in (1) a greater incidence of enterococci with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides among blood isolates; (2) gentamicin resistance predicting kanamycin high-level resistance; and (3) more resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin among enterococcus faecium isolates compared to those of enterococcus faecalis. beta-lactamase activity was not detected.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == enterococci are frequently encountered in urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal  tract infections and are increasingly being recognized in nosocomial bacteriuria  and bacteremia. undoubtedly, however, the most serious of all enterococcal infections is endocarditis. at present, enterococci are the third most common cause of infective endocarditis (after streptococci and staphylococcus aureus), and the incidence of the disease is likely to grow as the population ages and increasing numbers of persons are placed at risk by degenerative valve disease and by predisposition to enterococcal infections through portals such as the genitourinary tract. the case presented here exemplifies many features of enterococcal endocarditis. it also illustrates the therapeutic issues and dilemmas faced in managing this disorder. although a transesophageal approach (figure 1) has increased the sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities in infective endocarditis, diagnosis continues to rely on  blood cultures--which raises the question of how long antimicrobial therapy should be delayed for collection of blood samples. since enterococcal isolates are often resistant to antibiotics, therapy is based on synergistic drug combinations.

TI  == in vitro activity of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin against multidrug-resistant enterococci.
AB  == we evaluated the in vitro susceptibility of 140 clinical enterococcal isolates to the quinolones sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin. isolates included enterococcus faecalis (107), enterococcus faecium (29), enterococcus raffinosus (3), and one enterococcus gallinarum. there were 111 isolates that showed high-level [minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mics) > or = 2000 micrograms/ml] resistance to gentamicin and were resistant to high levels of all other aminoglycosides; five isolates produced beta-lactamase; 21 isolates were resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin and were not beta-lactamase producers; and 13 strains were resistant (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to vancomycin. most strains  were susceptible to low concentrations of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin, with mic90s of 0.6 microgram/ml and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. there were no inoculum effects. time-kill experiments were performed with 22 strains; using 2 x mic at 24 h, a > or = 2 log10 reduction in growth was observed with sparfloxacin  and clinafloxacin for 14 and 17 strains, respectively. time-kill synergism experiments were performed with 15 strains lacking high-level aminoglycoside resistance. in vitro bacterial synergism with the combination of sparfloxacin or  clinafloxacin with streptomycin or gentamicin was observed for five and 12 isolates, respectively. the bactericidal activity of sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin suggest that these antibiotics may prove useful for therapy of multidrug resistant enterococci.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == a gene conferring resistance to vancomycin but not teicoplanin in isolates of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium demonstrates homology with vanb, vana, and vanc genes of enterococci.
AB  == we report the sequence of a 630-bp fragment of a gene associated with resistance  to high levels of vancomycin in a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis which retained susceptibility to teicoplanin. this gene was similar to the recently sequenced vanb and partially homologous with vana, but it showed less-marked similarity to vanc. a dna probe, derived from this polymerase chain reaction-amplified gene fragment, hybridized specifically with genomic dna from enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis isolates which were vancomycin resistant (mics ranged from 8 to 512 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to teicoplanin. curing  of vancomycin resistance was associated with loss of dna hybridization with the gene probe. transfer of dna which hybridized with the probe accompanied transfer  of vancomycin resistance to a susceptible recipient strain. neither curing nor transfer of vancomycin resistance was consistently related to loss or acquisition, respectively, of plasmid dna.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

AB  == patients with enterococcal bacteremia due to strains with and without high-level  gentamicin resistance (hlgr; mic, > 2,000 mg/l) were compared. between 1986 and 1991, there were 178 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia: 47 and 131 episodes, respectively, due to enterococcal strains with and without hlgr. sixty-two, 57, and 59 episodes, respectively, were in patients with transient bacteremia (a single positive blood culture), bacteremia (two or more positive blood cultures), and polymicrobial bacteremia. nosocomial bacteremia accounted for 61.7% and 51.1% of episodes due to strains with and without hlgr, respectively. all isolates were strains of enterococcus faecalis except for 13 strains of enterococcus faecium, 4 of enterococcus avium, and 3 of enterococcus durans. although the mortality was slightly higher among patients infected with strains with hlgr than among those infected with strains without hlgr (38.3% vs. 30.5%, respectively), there was no  statistical difference. the mortality rate was adversely affected by old age (p < .01) and rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying conditions (p < .001). the addition of gentamicin to the treatment regimens had no effect on mortality.

TI  == ability of clinical laboratories to detect antimicrobial agent-resistant enterococci.
AB  == to test the ability of clinical laboratories to detect antimicrobial resistance among enterococci, we sent four vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains and one beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus to all 93 nongovernment, hospital-based clinical laboratories in new jersey; 76 (82%) participated in the study. each organism was tested by the laboratory's routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. the proportion of laboratories that correctly reported that an isolate was resistant to vancomycin varied according to the resistance level of the isolate: high-level resistance (mic for enterococcus faecium = 512 micrograms/ml), 96% of laboratories correct; moderate-level resistance (mic for e. faecium = 64 micrograms/ml), 27% correct; low-level resistance (mic for enterococcus faecalis = 32 micrograms/ml), 16% correct; and intrinsic low-level resistance (mic for enterococcus gallinarum = 8 micrograms/ml), 74% correct. the  beta-lactamase-producing e. faecalis isolate was identified as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin by 66 and 8% of laboratories, respectively, but only three laboratories recognized that it was a beta-lactamase producer. this survey  suggests that many laboratories may fail to detect antimicrobial agent-resistant  enterococci.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci in vitro.
AB  == treating patients with enterococcal infections has become difficult because of the emergence of several resistant traits in the past decade, including high-level resistance to gentamicin, beta-lactamase production, non-beta-lactamase-associated penicillin resistance and vancomycin resistance. to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and to survey the antibiotic resistance of enterococci, we tested 111 clinical isolates of enterococci from the national taiwan university hospital from 1990 to 1991. there were 102 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, five of enterococcus faecium, and four of other enterococcal species. all these isolates were tested in vitro by the agar dilution method for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic),  by the broth microdilution test for screening of high-level resistance to gentamicin and by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method for detection of beta-lactamase production. the effect of the combination of two antimicrobial agents against 20 of the 111 isolates, including strains with high-level and low-level resistance to gentamicin, were further checked by the checkerboard titration method. among 17 antimicrobial agents, the most active agent was ampicillin, followed by vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and penicillin. although none included in these were beta-lactamase producers or vancomycin-resistant strains, there was a high proportion (62%) with high-level resistance to gentamicin among our isolates. there were 11 isolates, seven enterococcus faecalis and four enterococcus faecium, which had mics beyond the clinically achievable level of penicillin (mic > or = 64 micrograms/ml). because  these resistant isolates of enterococci have important therapeutic implications,  periodic surveillance and mic testing are suggested.

AB  == we are reporting on a nosocomial outbreak of 213 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infection involving 2,812 enterococcal isolates from patients over a period of 36 months. in 1990, the enterococcus faecium vancomycin susceptibility  rate was found to be 85.7% (36 of 42 cases), and an incidence of 10.9% (42 of 383) was noted. the 1991 data showed e. faecium with a vancomycin susceptibility  rate of 61.8% (110 of 178) and an incidence of 26.0% (178 of 684). subsequently,  in 1992, the incidence of e. faecium increased to 34.0% (599 of 1,745), with a decreased vancomycin susceptibility rate of 25.8% (155 of 599). the e. faecalis vancomycin susceptibility rate remained near 97% (1,768 of 1,823) over the 36-month period. of 115 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) clinical isolates identified by the microscan mic combo-6 panels (baxter healthcare, sacramento, calif.), the agar dilution method indicated the resistance rate to be 92.3% (106  of 115) (high level), 3.5% (4 of 115) midlevel, and 3.5% (4 of 115) (low level).  genotypic characterization of 32 different vre isolates by field-inversion gel electrophoresis demonstrated 19 dissimilar restriction endonuclease patterns, with 9 patterns associated with vre quinolone resistance. statistical analysis of case-control data for 32 patients with vre infections indicated a positive association with intrabdominal surgical procedures (odds ratio, 24.12), multidrug therapy (odds ratio, 37.80), preexposure to vancomycin (odds ratio, 20.21), and death (odds ratio, 17.50).

TI  == the vanb gene confers various levels of self-transferable resistance to vancomycin in enterococci.
AB  == thirty-nine strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin on disk susceptibility testing (phenotypic class b) were isolated in 15 hospitals in europe and the united states. the mics of vancomycin for these strains ranged from 4 to 1024 micrograms/ml. part of the vancomycin resistance gene vanb from e. faecalis v583  hybridized with a single but variably sized hindiii-kpni fragment of total dna from all 39 strains. this indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for the vanb phenotype. no hybridization was detected with  dna from intrinsically resistant enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus casseliflavus. hybridization with dna from enterococcal strains susceptible to or with acquired resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not observed. the genes conferring resistance to vancomycin were self-transferable to other enterococcus strains in 14 of the 39 strains. it thus appears that vanb confers various levels of conjugative vancomycin resistance in enterococci.

AB  == over a 10-month period, 22 beta-lactamase negative e. faecium strains resistant to ampicillin were isolated from severely compromised hospitalized patients. most isolates were clinically significant. twenty of these strains were also resistant to extraordinarily high levels of gentamicin, a finding described rarely in e. faecium. by whole-cell dna restriction endonuclease digestion, the 20 strains with both ampicillin and high-level gentamicin resistance segregated into only 3  different groups, suggesting introduction of limited clones into this population  of patients. plasmid dna profiles and plasmid dna restriction enzyme analysis supported this grouping for 18 of these 20 strains, the two remaining isolates had slightly different profiles. both strains lacking high-level gentamicin resistance had clearly different molecular profiles. the results of hybridization experiments strongly suggested the presence of a similar genetic determinant of high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium. high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecium was shown to be transferable on conjugative plasmids, so that further dissemination of this resistance trait may be anticipated. our data indicate that the use of a nucleic acid probe is a promising diagnostic tool for screening both e. faecium and e. faecalis for high-level gentamicin resistance.

TI  == prevalence of enterococcal high-level aminoglycoside resistance in japan. comparative detection by three methods.
AB  == a total of 250 strains of enterococci isolated in kumamoto university hospital, japan, during the period from january to march 1992 were tested for high-level aminoglycoside resistance. brain-heart infusion (bhi) agar plates supplemented with 1000 micrograms/ml of gentamicin or 2000 micrograms/ml of streptomycin detected 164 (66%) isolates resistant to either gentamicin or streptomycin alone, or both, and consisted of 107 (43%) resistant to gentamicin and 96 (38%) resistant to streptomycin. the vitek gram-positive susceptibility card (gps-ta) revealed high correlations with those by agar screens, the results indicating a sensitivity of 100% and 99% to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively, and 100% specificity to both. also, the microdilution tests of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) showed 100% and 92% sensitivity to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively, and no false resistance (100% specificity) when compared with the results by agar screens.

TI  == species identification and determination of high-level aminoglycoside resistance  among enterococci. comparison study of sterile body fluid isolates, 1985-1991.
AB  == enterococcus spp. have become the third most common cause of nosocomial infections. high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlr), an important clinical concern, has been associated with some species of the enterococci. we evaluated the vitek and api 20s systems for species identification and the vitek for the detection of hlr. enterococci from nosocomial infections (208 strains) at the university of iowa hospital (1985-1991) were tested by vitek, api 20s, and reference methods. the error rate for species identification was 6.7% for the api 20s and 5.8% for the vitek gram-positive identification (gpi) cards. both systems tended to incorrectly identify other enterococcal species as enterococcus faecium. hlr was found in enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates only. the highest rates of hlr to streptomycin alone (17.9%) and with gentamicin (13.5%) was observed among e. faecalis strains, and to gentamicin alone (7.3%) was found  among e. faecium isolates. no apparent differences in hlr rates were found from year-to-year over the 7-year enterococcus sample interval. susceptibility errors  for vitek were among the streptomycin tests only. our results demonstrated acceptable performance by the vitek cards for enterococcal species identification and the detection of hlr. api 20s also provided an acceptable ability to speciate the enterococci within its data base, however, both systems must be improved by adding other clinical important enterococcus species.

TI  == characterization of tn1546, a tn3-related transposon conferring glycopeptide resistance by synthesis of depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors in enterococcus  faecium bm4147.
AB  == sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pip816 in enterococcus faecium bm4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the tn3 family. imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated tn1546. the 4-kb region located upstream from the vanr gene contained two open reading frames (orf) transcribed in opposite directions. the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of tn4430 from bacillus thuringiensis and of tn917 from enterococcus faecalis. the product of orf2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the res protein (48%) of plasmid pip404 from clostridium perfringens. tn1546 transposed consecutively in escherichia coli from plasmid puc18 into pox38 and from pox38 into various sites of pbr329. transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. southern hybridization and dna amplification revealed the presence of tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant  to glycopeptides. analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of e. faecium.

TI  == occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. type a (high-level) resistance was described in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. it is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. type b (low-level) resistance described in e. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of  a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. type c resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to e. gallinarum. among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. they produce an approximately 39-kda cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. the era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == absence of synergistic activity between ampicillin and vancomycin against highly  vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == the emergence of clinical enterococcal isolates resistant to both ampicillin and  vancomycin is a cause of great concern, as there are few therapeutic alternatives for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. we evaluated the effects of the combination of ampicillin with vancomycin against vancomycin-resistant clinical enterococcal isolates. using both the checkerboard technique and time-kill curves, we examined 28 strains of enterococci (17 enterococcus faecalis and 11 enterococcus faecium strains) with different levels of resistance to vancomycin. of these, 15 strains were also highly gentamicin resistant, and 9 demonstrated resistance to ampicillin. only seven strains of e. faecalis were inhibited synergistically by the combination of vancomycin with ampicillin, and even then, the concentrations of vancomycin at which synergism was demonstrated were above levels achievable in serum. none of the ampicillin-resistant isolates  (all e. faecium) were inhibited synergistically at any concentration of the drugs. in no instance was bactericidal synergism observed, and in most cases the  combination resulted in less killing than with ampicillin alone. antagonism was not observed at clinically relevant concentrations. the results of this study suggest that the combination of vancomycin with ampicillin has little to offer against these emerging pathogens.

TI  == [a comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  == vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. they have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. in vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. the activity of the two antibiotics against  staphylococcus aureus is similar. the serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). we compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the mic90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. the inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin mic was lower.

TI  == new vancomycin disk diffusion breakpoints for enterococci. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards working group on enterococci.
AB  == since 1988, when the first vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was described, several descriptions of failures of disk diffusion breakpoints to detect low-level vancomycin resistance (mics, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml) have been published. a four-laboratory collaborative study was undertaken to establish more accurate breakpoints for the disk test. mueller-hinton agar was used to perform dilution testing (in three laboratories) and disk diffusion testing (in all laboratories). results were determined at 18, 24, and 48 h, and zones of inhibition were read using both transmitted and reflected light. one hundred organisms (35 enterococcus faecalis, 55 e. faecium, and 10 e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus isolates) were selected to represent vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes. interlaboratory agreement of agar dilution mics was better at 24 h (91 to 94% within +/- 1 dilution) than at 18 h (76% within +/- 1 dilution). therefore, 24-h agar dilution mic results were used as the reference.  for disk diffusion, it was critical to note the presence of a haze or colonies inside the zone when interpreting the test, since this correlated better with the results of the agar dilution test. the presence of a haze or inner colonies was best detected by reading the zones with transmitted light and incubating the plates for a full 24 h. when plotted against 24-h agar dilution mics, breakpoints of </= 14 mm (resistant), 15 to 16 mm (intermediate), and >/= 17 mm (susceptible) resulted in 58 minor errors (14.5% of total values) and 5 very major errors (2.2% of resistant values or 1.3% of total values). no major errors were seen. results  of repeat testing using a common lot of mueller-hinton agar showed 52 minor errors (13.3%) and 4 major errors (4.2% of susceptible values of 1.0% pf total values) but no very major errors. it is recommended that any haze or colonies within the zone be taken into account when determining zones of inhibition and that an mic test be performed for strains with intermediate zones if vancomycin is being considered for treatment.

AB  == a restriction enzyme analysis (rea) of chromosomal dna for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. the dna was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme sal i to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. one hundred and  eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated british antarctic survey base. the epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. this technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and e. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. a sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 s ribosomal rna from escherichia coli. discrimination between isolates was poorer than with rea, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.

TI  == detection of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus species.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates that are resistant to vancomycin have recently been identified in north america and europe. of 155 clinical isolates of enterococci (113 e. faecium and 42 e. faecalis), we found that 98 were resistant, 52 were moderately susceptible, and 5 had intermediate susceptibilities to vancomycin by using broth microdilution susceptibility testing according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) (approved standard m7-a2). using nccls disk diffusion methodology (approved standard m2-a4), we evaluated the nccls supplemental m100-s3 revisions  for zone diameter interpretive standards and incubation conditions and found 5.8% minor errors. a total of 234 isolates, which included an additional 79 e. faecium isolates that were moderately susceptible to vancomycin, were used to evaluate the vitek gps-ta card (biomerieux, inc., hazelwood, mo.) and the pos mic type 6 panel (microscan; baxter health care corp., west sacramento, calif.) for the detection of vancomycin resistance. the vitek card was 100% specific and 72% sensitive, whereas the microscan panel with the walk/away system was 98% specific, with a sensitivity of 93% which increased to 99% when readings were performed manually. an agar screen plate method was evaluated with vancomycin concentrations of 6, 8, 10, or 12 micrograms/ml; plates were inoculated so as to  obtain a final concentration of 10(5) cfu per spot. this method was found to be 100% sensitive and specific at all concentrations.

TI  == streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in patients with cancer.
AB  == eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at institut jules bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. the incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by streptococcus angionosus, streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (a, b, c, and g). twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. one-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microl). only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal  adult respiratory distress syndrome. the source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. no unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one s. mitis and one e. faecium. no relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.

TI  == characterization and partial purification of a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc carnosum la44a.
AB  == twenty leuconostoc strains isolated from vacuum packaged vienna-type sausages were screened for antagonistic activity against various gram-positive organisms (including listeria spp.). one of the three strains exhibiting inhibitory activity was chosen for further investigation. this strain was identified as leuc. carnosum and the inhibitory substance produced was named carnosin. carnosin was inactivated by trypsin but not by catalase or other non-proteolytic enzymes tested. carnosin retained activity after heating at 100 degrees c for 20 min, whereas heating at 121 degrees c for 15 min resulted in complete loss of activity. carnosin was active at ph values ranging from 2 to 9. carnosin activity was not detectable until cells were in the late log-phase of growth. at low temperatures (4 degrees c), higher cell densities were required before carnosin activity could be detected. carnosin was active against various lactic acid bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against listeria spp. difficulties in purification were reduced by growing leuc. carnosum in a modified mrs medium, having 50% of the normal peptone concentration and no tween  or meat extract. sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of partially purified carnosin indicated that it has a molecular mass between 2510 and 6000 da. yet, retention of activity after exhaustive dialysis suggested a molecular mass > 14kda. it is hypothesized that carnosin forms large active complexes which can be dissociated to small (active) components.

TI  == identical genes confer high-level resistance to gentamicin upon enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == the structural gene coding for the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying 6'-acetyltransferase-2''-phosphotransferase (6'aac-2''aph) enzyme was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using template dna of clinical isolates of enterococci (both enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) and the single high-level gentamicin-resistant streptococcus agalactiae  strain identified thus far. the results of the present study demonstrated that the genes encoding this antibiotic resistance trait are highly homologous in these species. in dot blot hybridization assays using nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, strains with and without high-level gentamicin resistance could be discerned unequivocally. the gene segment encoding 6'-acetylating activity and the gene segment encoding 2''-phosphorylating activity were simultaneously present in all isolates exhibiting high-level gentamicin resistance.

TI  == [studies of bacterial indicators for water pollution--growth of escherichia coli  and enterococci in limited nutrient conditions].
AB  == bacteria, that would be an ideal indicator for fecal contamination in environmental water, should not proliferate but at the same time should survive a little longer than enteropathogenic bacteria in the environmental water. while conventional methods have recommended escherichia coli as an indicator, enterococci is recommended as a preferable indicator for the estimation of fecal  contamination based on the following observation. the relationship between the specific growth rate of organism and the concentration of peptone was determined  and the value of ks, a parameter analogous to michaelis-menten constant, was estimated. ks of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 3.8, 11.1 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively, indicating that escherichia coli will grow at lower concentration of peptone than enterococci. escherichia coli also grew in human fecal suspension and in filtrated (0.22 microns) river water, and while in those conditions enterococci did not grow or survive longer than escherichia coli, survival time was longer than for salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. it appears that enterococci reflect more accurately actual fecal contamination.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

AB  == enterococci have emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infection. successful antibiotic treatment of serious enterococcal infection usually depends on the synergistic bactericidal effect achieved by the combination of a cell wall-active agent, such as ampicillin or a glycopeptide, and an aminoglycoside. however, the prevalence of enterococci resistant to one or more of these antibiotics is increasing, and has resulted in serious therapeutic difficulties.  the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and the epidemiology, laboratory diagnosis and management of infection with antibiotic-resistant enterococci are discussed.

TI  == high-level resistance to gentamicin in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == during a six-month period in a hospital in ireland, four patients were infected (isolation from blood cultures) and two were colonized (isolation from rectal swabs) with strains of enterococcus faecium highly resistant to gentamicin. mics  of gentamicin were greater than 1000 mg/l for all six strains, and each possessed a plasmid of approximately 50 mda. resistance to gentamicin was transferable by conjugation from two of the six strains, and was associated with transfer of the  50 mda plasmid. this plasmid hybridized with a dna probe specific for the bifunctional aac(6')-aph(2") aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme. the mechanism of high-level gentamicin resistance in these strains appeared therefore, to be identical to that encountered in enterococcus faecalis strains worldwide and reported in e. faecium strains in the usa.

TI  == typing of enterococcus species by dna restriction fragment analysis.
AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of hospital-acquired infection, being associated with urinary tract infections, wound sepsis, bacteremia, and endocarditis. the source of infection is usually thought to be endogenous, but some evidence points to cross-infection between patients. a better understanding of the epidemiology of enterococci has been limited by the lack of a good discriminatory typing system. this report describes the application of two dna-based typing methods to  enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium: comparison of restriction fragments from total dna by conventional electrophoresis and comparison of restriction fragments hybridizing to an rrna gene probe (ribotyping). comparison  of restriction fragments (from ssti digestion) by conventional electrophoresis was simple and highly discriminatory. the results of analysis of blood culture isolates and of repeat isolates from individual patients are reported. ribotyping (with bsci digestion) was more applicable at the level of species discrimination.

AB  == the beta-lactam resistance of genus streptococcus has been explained by the low binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) to the drug. this study was carried out to resolve the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the species of genus enterococcus by means of binding affinities of pbps. streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and  enterococcus avium were employed as assay microbes. cefepime (cfpm) and ampicillin (abpc) were used as representatives of cephems and penicillins, respectively. all the pbp fractions of s. pyogenes manifested high binding affinities to cfpm and abpc, whereas pbps 1 and 4 of e. faecalis showed high binding affinities to abpc but not to cfpm. in e. faecium, pbps of an exceptionally penicillin-susceptible strain manifested a high binding affinity to abpc, but pbps 5 and 6 showed low affinities to cfpm. beta-lactam resistant strains of e. faecium possessed pbps 5 and 6 with low binding affinities to cfpm  and abpc. all the fractions of pbps but pbp 1 in e. avium showed low binding affinities to cfpm. although all the pbp fractions but pbps 3 and 6 manifested high binding affinities to abpc, pbps 3 and 6 showed low binding affinities to abpc. a strain of e. avium, which is susceptible to abpc but moderately resistant to cfpm, lacked pbp 6. in conclusion, the resistance of e. avium to cfpm is based upon low binding affinities of the many fractions to this drug, and abpc resistance is based upon pbps 3 and 6 with low binding affinities to abpc.

TI  == concomitant high-level vancomycin and penicillin resistance in clinical isolates  of enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens among which resistance to multiple antibiotics is being recognized with increasing frequency. we characterized three clinical isolates from three new york city hospitals that demonstrated concomitant resistance to vancomycin (one vana, two vanb phenotypes) and high-level resistance to penicillin. two enterococcus faecium strains were intrinsically highly resistant to penicillin and showed very low affinity for penicillin of penicillin-binding protein 5. unlike previously described glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, these strains were not hypersusceptible to beta-lactam agents after vancomycin induction, and combinations of penicillin and vancomycin were not synergistic against them. a third isolate, enterococcus faecalis, produced beta-lactamase. two of the three strains were also highly resistant to all aminoglycosides. emergence of concomitant high-level resistance  to multiple antibiotic classes among enterococci considerably narrows the therapeutic options for treatment of infections due to these opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci.
AB  == in recent years enterococci have been isolated with increasing frequency in association with serious infections. suitable therapy for empirical treatment can only be chosen on the basis of susceptibility studies. the synergistic effects obtained by the combination of aminoglycosides with penicillin or vancomycin disappear in strains that show high level resistance (hlr) to the former. this highlights the importance of correct identification of the species of enterococcus (especially enterococcus faecium, a particularly resistant species), and of studies designed to examine hlr in severe infections. the preferred methods are dilution in solid or liquid medium with 2,000 micrograms of aminoglycoside per ml, or diffusion in solid medium from discs impregnated with 120 micrograms of gentamicin (which also predicts the microorganism's susceptibility to tobramycin and netilmicin) or kanamycin (which also predicts the response to amikacin), and 300 micrograms of streptomycin, for enterococcus faecalis. the reliability of automated systems for the prediction of hlr to aminoglycosides has yet to be assessed.

AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.

TI  == detection of penicillin-binding proteins immunologically related to penicillin-binding protein 5 of enterococcus hirae atcc 9790 in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of enterococcus hirae atcc 9790 belongs to the class of the high-molecular mass, low-affinity pbps which have been correlated with penicillin resistance in most enterococcus species. polyclonal antibodies were raised against pbp 5 and used to detect immunologically related membrane proteins in e. faecium and e. faecalis strains. several strains of both species were found to have a membrane protein of similar molecular mass to e. hirae pbp 5 which reacted with the antibodies. some e. faecium strains did not react with antibodies but their derivatives with increased penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations did. in some e. faecalis strains the lack of a pbp 5-related protein was associated with failure to select stable penicillin-resistant derivatives.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic sk&f 104662 against problematic gram-positive microorganisms was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, ampicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, erythromycin and gentamicin were tested. sk&f 104662 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin sensitive and resistant strains), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jeikeium and corynebacterium group d2. all of 254 isolates, except one vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium, were inhibited by 2 mg/l of sk&f 104662; this compound may thus be potentially useful in the treatment of infections with the above-mentioned gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in nagoya university hospital from april 1983 to march 1990. we analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with enterococcal septicemia. thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 enterococcus faecalis, 10 enterococcus faecium)  were subjected in this study. twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. as to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. e. faecium and enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than e. faecalis. enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.

TI  == enterococcal bacteremia: to treat or not to treat, a reappraisal.
AB  == the treatment of enterococcal bacteremia not associated with endocarditis has been controversial. we retrospectively reviewed 81 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia and categorized them as to their clinical significance, using a strict case definition. of the 81 episodes, 41 met our criteria for clinical significance. mortality was 51% among the 41 patients with clinically significant bacteremia and 50% among the 40 patients with bacteremia of uncertain clinical significance. despite these equivalent overall mortality figures, antibiotic therapy specific for enterococcus species was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality among patients with clinically significant infections (relative risk [rr] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.27-0.77); mortality was also reduced in the first 7 days after the detection of bacteremia, when death was relatively likely to be directly due to the bacteremic episode (rr = 0.17, ci = 0.04-0.74). the association between appropriate antibiotic therapy and reduced mortality remained statistically significant when adjustments were made for a number of other factors related to mortality, including age, underlying conditions, prior use of antibiotics, nosocomial acquisition, polymicrobial etiology, prior surgery, and source of infection. thus enterococcal isolates from the blood, even when of doubtful clinical significance, are poor prognostic markers associated with high mortality. however, when the clinical significance of bacteremia is defined by strict criteria, specific therapy against enterococcus species is associated with improved outcome.

TI  == composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  == identification to species level showed that enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. two species, ent. faecium and streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. enterococcus hirae and ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. in layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, ent. cecorum dominated with strep. alactolyticus ranking next. other species were isolated irregularly. enterococcus avium and ent. gallinarum,  originally described from chickens, were rarely found. these species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.

TI  == enumeration by a miniaturized method of escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  == counts of escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. consequently the use of the ratio e. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces,  streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also  of pig faeces whereas enterococcus durans, ent. hirae and ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (ttc)  in the medium.

AB  == the tetracycline (tet) determinants, which encode resistance either to tetracyclines without minocycline (tcr) or to tetracyclines including minocycline (tcr-mnr), of 30 wild-type clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium were identified and localized. the tet determinants were transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor, as follows: tcr, 6 strains; tcr-mnr, 14 strains; both tcr and tcr-mnr, 6 strains; no detectable transfer, 4 strains. classes l (tcr phenotype) and m and o (tcr-mnr phenotype) of the tet determinants were identified by dna-dna hybridization experiments. the tet l determinant was plasmid-borne in 18 strains and was chromosomal in 2 strains. tet m was chromosomal in 27 strains and plasmid-borne (pip1534) in 1 strain; pip1534 also carried tet l. tet m was located on tn916-like elements in 22 strains and on a tn916-modified element in 1 strain. tet o was detected in only one strain in which it was plasmid-borne. both tet l and tet m determinants were carried by 19  strains. one strain carried, in addition to chromosomal nonconjugative tet l and  tet m determinants, a conjugative tcr-mnr marker which did not correspond to any  tet determinant tested in this study. these results attest to the genetic complexity of tetracycline resistance in e. faecium strains.

AB  == this study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. the lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of enterococcus faecalis kiel 27738 (i), enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecium) atcc 9790 (ii), and leuconostoc mesenteroides dms 20343 (iii). lipoteichoic acids ii and iii are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. lipoteichoic acid i is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. lipoteichoic acids i and iii additionally carry d-alanine ester. lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-a-sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. it was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. the chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid i and ii vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid iii appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. all lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.

AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == in vitro detection of enterococcal vancomycin resistance.
AB  == by using agar dilution as the standard method, we determined the ability of broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and an automated system (ams vitek) to detect three different levels of vancomycin resistance among six enterococcal isolates.  enterococcus gallinarum aib-38 and aib-39 exhibited low-level resistance (mic, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) that was detected only by agar and broth dilution methods. e. faecalis v583, e. faecium aib-42, and e. faecalis aib-41 showed moderately high-level resistance (mic, 128 to 256 micrograms/ml) that was detected by dilution methods but not by disk diffusion unless prolonged incubation or an inoculum 10-fold greater than the standard was used. similarly, this level of resistance was detected by ams vitek only when an inoculum 10-fold larger than recommended was used. the high resistance demonstrated by e. faecium aib-40 (mic, 2,048 micrograms/ml) was readily detected by all methods studied. variation in the ability of different methods to detect vancomycin resistance among enterococci complicates monitoring the incidence of these organisms and could result in very major susceptibility reporting errors.

TI  == evaluation of microscan for identification of enterococcus species.
AB  == emerging drug resistance of the enterococci necessitates differentiation from group d streptococci and accurate species identification. microscan (baxter healthcare corp., west sacramento, calif.) has recently developed a microdilution system for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive  cocci. to evaluate the ability of this system to identify enterococcus species, 100 isolate identified as enterococci by microscan were tested by conventional media and 60 isolates of streptococci were tested by microscan. incubation times  for conventional and microscan methods were 96 and 18 to 24 h, respectively. for  94 strains of enterococci (77 enterococcus faecalis, 14 enterococcus faecium, and 3 enterococcus durans), identification by conventional media and microscan agreed. of the remaining six isolates, four were identified as e. faecalis and two were identified as e. durans by microscan, whereas by conventional media the  four e. faecalis isolates were identified as enterococcus solitarius and the two  e. durans isolates were identified as enterococcus hirae. none of the 60 streptococci were identified as enterococci. microscan is a reliable method for identification of the commonly encountered enterococcal species e. faecalis and e. faecium; however, modifications of the system are necessary for identification of other enterococcus species.

TI  == technologically important characteristics of enterococcus isolates from milk and  dairy products.
AB  == enterococcus faecium (54 strains), e. faecalis (40 strains), and e. durans (14) were isolated from various dairy products (raw milk, cream, butter and fermented  milk products) during a previous study (wessels et al., 1988). in this article various characteristics of these isolates, which may have a bearing on their significance in dairy products, have been studied. a large percentage of the identified strains of all three species were able to grow at 7 degrees c. seventy-six percent of the e. faecium strains, 62% e. faecalis and 50% e. durans  strains also showed proteolytic activity at psychrotrophic temperatures. the fact that proteolytic activity could be detected within 2 days at 7 degrees c is significant, since bulk cooled milk is normally held for 3 to 4 days at temperatures between 4 and 7 degrees c at farms or factories prior to processing. this examination confirmed that enterococci are proteolytic rather than lipolytic.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

AB  == the conjugative transfer by using a filter mating method in 109 cases of combinations between 20 strains of beta-hemolytic enterococcus faecalis and 28 strains of alpha-hemolytic enterococcus faecium was tried. a stable transconjugation was observed in two cases: from e. faecalis no. 170 to e. faecium no. 49 and from e. faecalis no. 500 to e. faecium no. 48. from the results, it was proved that the beta-hemolysin plasmid of e. faecalis is transferred by conjugation to e. faecium. the virulence (ld50) of e. faecium no.  17049, no. 50048 (heterogeneous transconjugant) and e. faecalis no. 17067, no. 50067 (homologous transconjugant) in mice was compared with their parent strains. the virulence of e. faecalis transconjugants was more marked than that of the recipients. however, the virulence of e. faecium transconjugants was not enhanced. this fact suggests that, only in e. faecalis, does beta-hemolysin play  a role in its pathogenicity in mice. beta-hemolysin in e. faecium transconjugants does not participate in pathogenicity in mice. it may be due to the fact that it  takes more time to cause beta-hemolysis on blood agar plate or beta-hemolysin production in b-yeg broth by e. faecium transconjugants than by e. faecalis transconjugants.

AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == mechanism of resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus faecium d366 and enterococcus faecalis a256.
AB  == the role of the glycopeptide-inducible proteins of enterococcus faecium d366 (39.5 kilodaltons) and enterococcus faecalis a256 (39 kilodaltons) in the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was examined. crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. this protection could be competitively abolished by d-alanyl-d-alanine. a decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. we hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.

TI  == the life and times of the enterococcus.
AB  == enterococci are important human pathogens that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. these organisms were previously considered part of the genus streptococcus but have recently been reclassified into their own genus, called enterococcus. to date, 12 species pathogenic for humans have been described, including the most common human isolates, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. enterococci cause between 5 and 15% of cases of endocarditis, which is best treated by the combination of a cell wall-active agent (such as penicillin or vancomycin, neither of which alone is usually bactericidal) and an aminoglycoside to which the organism is not highly resistant; this characteristically results in a synergistic bactericidal effect. high-level resistance (mic, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to the aminoglycoside eliminates the expected bactericidal effect, and such resistance has now been described for all aminoglycosides. enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections; intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections; superinfections (particularly in patients receiving expanded-spectrum cephalosporins); and bacteremias (often together with other organisms). they are  now the third most common organism seen in nosocomial infections. for most of these infections, single-drug therapy, most often with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin, is adequate. enterococci have a large number of both inherent and acquired resistance traits, including resistance to cephalosporins, clindamycin,  tetracycline, and penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as oxacillin, among others. the most recent resistance traits reported are penicillinase resistance (apparently acquired from staphylococci) and vancomycin resistance, both of which can be transferred to other enterococci. it appears likely that we will soon be faced with increasing numbers of enterococci for which there is no adequate therapy.

AB  == investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence  of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant  to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.

TI  == inducible, transferable resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus faecium, d399.
AB  == enterococcus faecium d399 was isolated from the blood and peritoneal abscess of a patient with intraabdominal sepsis. the patient had not been treated with vancomycin, but the strain was found to be resistant with a mic of 1000 mg/l. resistance was inducible and transferable (probably by conjugation) to jh2-2, and correlated with induction of synthesis of a 39 kda protein. this mechanism appears to be identical to that previously described for e. faecalis a256, suggesting that dissemination of this form of glycopeptide resistance has already occurred. the resistance phenotype of d399, however, differed somewhat from that  found in other enterococcal strains with inducible resistance.

TI  == regulation of the cytoplasmic ph by a proton-translocating atpase in streptococcus faecalis (faecium). a computer simulation.
AB  == earlier work from this laboratory led to the proposal that the cytoplasmic ph of  streptococcal cells is regulated solely by changes in the amount and activity of  a proton-translocating atpase, f1f0 complex [kobayashi, h., suzuki, t. & unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630]. we have now examined the proposal with the aid of computer simulation. we find that an increase in the amount of the h+-atpase is necessary for ph regulation and is sufficient to maintain a constant steady-state cytoplasmic ph. an increase in h+-atpase activity is insufficient by itself to maintain a constant cytoplasmic ph, but suppresses the initial fluctuation of the ph. when both variations were allowed, the simulated cytoplasmic ph remained constant despite large perturbations, suggesting that this regulatory system has ample capacity to compensate for ph changes. the present work shows that a computer simulation is a useful way to examine a model  for biological regulatory system; application of the simulation to other regulatory systems is discussed.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

AB  == the mics and mbcs of ci-934, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin (a-56619), a-56620, norfloxacin, enoxacin, amifloxacin, and coumermycin were determined for 43 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis known to be resistant to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy. results were compared with those obtained for  37 synergy-susceptible e. faecalis and 22 enterococcus faecium strains. although  no substantial differences in quinolone activities were observed between synergy-resistant and -susceptible e. faecalis strains, ci-934 and ciprofloxacin  were the drugs that demonstrated the greatest bactericidal activity against both  types of e. faecalis. the mbcs of the other quinolones were generally within a single twofold dilution of the mics, but their antienterococcal activity did not  approach that of ci-934 or ciprofloxacin. the mbcs for 90% of the isolates of ci-934 for synergy-resistant and -susceptible e. faecalis strains were 1 and less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. the ciprofloxacin mbc for 90% of the e. faecalis strains tested was 1 microgram/ml. for e. faecium isolates the ci-934 and ciprofloxacin mbcs for 90% of the isolates were 8 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. time-kill assays performed with synergy-susceptible enterococcal strains showed that the bactericidal activities of both ci-934 and ciprofloxacin  were less than those of the penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations tested. however, against synergy-resistant isolates the activities of these two quinolones were comparable with and sometimes greater than those of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations.

TI  == norfloxacin binds to human fecal material.
AB  == earlier studies have reported very high (120 to 2,700 mg/kg) concentrations of norfloxacin in feces after therapeutic doses. mics for fecal microorganisms are with few exceptions far below these levels. nevertheless, clinical investigations show that the main part of the aerobic gram-positive and the anaerobic microflora remains unaffected after norfloxacin administration. in this study, the binding of [14c]norfloxacin to fecal material was analyzed. the binding of a group of nonlabeled quinolones to feces and the interactions between enterococcus faecium, bacteroides fragilis, and norfloxacin were also investigated. the results showed  that norfloxacin has the ability to bind to feces. the specific binding was reversible, saturated after 90 min of incubation at 37 degrees c, and increased linearly with fecal concentration. scatchard plots and nonlinear regression computer analyses revealed two different binding classes. the primary specific binding had a dissociation constant (kd) of 1.0 microm and a maximal binding capacity (bmax) of 0.12 mumol/g of feces. the kd and bmax of the secondary, more  unspecific binding were 450 microm and 11.8 mumol/g of feces, respectively. the binding of unlabeled ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin to feces was comparable to that of [14c]norfloxacin. the results of norfloxacin binding to suspensions of b. fragilis suggested that the main part of the binding is to the bacterial fraction of feces. in the presence of 8.0 g (dry  weight) of b. fragilis per liter, the mbc of norfloxacin for e. faecium increased from 8 to 256 micrograms/ml. the finding of the present study indicated that binding of norfloxacin to feces may explain the paradox of high fecal concentrations of norfloxacin versus the actual effect on the normal gastrointestinal microflora.

TI  == laboratory detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in enterococcus spp.
AB  == methods for detection of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 enterococcus faecalis and 7 enterococcus faecium). kanamycin was used to predict  resistance to amikacin. discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill  studies. four methods (microscan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for  detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. there were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, all of which were detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. microscan detected 2  (15%) of the 13. of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93%) were detected by disk diffusion, 16 (89%) by microtiter, 9 (50%) by macrotube, and 6 (33%) by microscan. an additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only by disk diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. the entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. all 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 19 by both methods. of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 51 by both methods. one additional strain which was resistant only by disk diffusion was susceptible  to amikacin plus penicillin by time-kill studies. disk diffusion is a suitable method for detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in e.  faecalis and is well suited for sporadic testing. additional data are necessary to determine the suitability of these tests for e. faecium.

TI  == high-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium.
AB  == during a 14-month period beginning in july 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (mic, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. by filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into streptococcus faecalis jh2-7 occurred at lower  frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (iii) phosphorylating enzymes, aac-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of s. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. all three  isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition  of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. loss of high-level gentamicin  resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in s. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of s.  faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.

TI  == novel streptococcal mutants defective in the regulation of h+-atpase biosynthesis and in f0 complex.
AB  == in streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic ph is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating f1f0-atpase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (kobayashi, h., suzuki, t., and unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630). we describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated as8 and as17, that contain atpase activity but fail to grow on acid media. our data suggested that in mutant as17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the f0 sector of the atpase but not the  f1 sector. the accumulation in the plasma membrane of f0 sectors devoid of f1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant as17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic ph in acid media. the genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the f1f0-atpase. mutant as8 does not generate a proton motive force. our results suggest that the f1f0-atpase can  hydrolyze atp but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the f0 sector.

AB  == we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to  3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less  than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  == impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  == the aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. the parameters  were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and  serum concentrations. there were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. in the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. in the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/l for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. ceftriaxone had a  pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: streptococcus faecium and candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of candida spp. was not influenced. growth of escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. overgrowth of candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. the results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of candida. cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. the observed overgrowth of candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. this applies especially to immunocompromised patients.

AB  == the survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of escherichia coli,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, ap17 and aq62, was examined in estuarine water. each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. none of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant aq62, resistant escherichia coli less than sensitive escherichia coli less than resistant ap17 less than resistant enterococcus faecium less than sensitive ap17, sensitive and  resistant s. equinus less than sensitive and resistant enterococcus faecalis, sensitive enterococcus faecium. the results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.

AB  == identification and susceptibility studies were performed on 301 blood and urine streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium isolates. strep trio-tubes s4, s5, and s3 (carr-scarborough microbiologicals, inc.) were compared with conventional methods for accuracy and rapidity. of 282 isolates identified as s.  faecalis, 98% were identified by species in 4 h with trio-tubes; the same percentage of isolates analyzed by conventional methods were identified in 24 h.  all 14 s. faecium isolates (approximately 5% of the total number of isolates) were identified by trio-tubes in 24 h. in vitro mic susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by the dynatech 2000 microdilution technique (dynatech laboratories, inc.). several newly developed antimicrobial agents, including imipenem (a carbapenem) and some of the quinolone drugs, i.e., ci-934, ciprofloxacin, a-56619, a-56620, amifloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin, were tested, as were ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. both ampicillin and vancomycin showed good activity against s. faecalis, with mics for 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; with s. faecium, ampicillin exhibited an mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml and vancomycin exhibited an mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. of the newer antimicrobial agents, imipenem and ci-934  exhibited the greatest activity against s. faecalis strains, with mic90s of 2 and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. mbcs against the isolates were determined with ci-934, with 90% of s. faecalis strains showing mbcs of 1 microgram/ml or less.

TI  == penicillin-binding proteins in streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of streptococcus faecalis nctc 775, s. faecium nctc 7171 and an isolate of s. faecium (strain 37) highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were visualised by autoradiography. five pbps were detected in s. faecalis nctc 775 and six in s. faecium nctc 7171. additional pbps could not be found in the resistant isolate of s. faecium. the pbp affinities of  beta lactams were compared with mic values. the affinities of pbps 3 and 4 of s.  faecalis nctc 775 for penicillin g, ampicillin, cefathiamidine, cephaloridine and cephazolin were related to the sensitivity of the strain to these antibiotics as  were the affinities of pbps 4 and 5 in each s. faecium strain for the beta lactams. it is postulated that pbps 3 and 4 of s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 4 and 5 of s. faecium are the relevant target enzymes of the test antibiotics. pbps 4 and 5 of the highly beta-lactam-resistant s. faecium strain 37 showed proportionally low affinities for the five beta lactams compared to that of the less resistant strain s. faecium nctc 7171. decreased affinities of pbps 4 and 5  may account for the resistance in s. faecium strain 37 to beta lactams. the affinities for pbp 1, 2 and 5 in s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 1, 2, 3 and 6 in s. faecium were not related to the antibiotic sensitivities.

TI  == biotyping, serotyping and phage typing of streptococcus faecalis isolated from dental plaque in the human mouth.
AB  == thirty streptococcus faecalis isolates from mixed dental plaque samples were classified into four groups on the basis of biotype, tetracycline susceptibility, phage type and serotype combinations. the organisms were from patients on haemodialysis, from staff of the dialysis unit, and from controls. three biotypes were distinguished by seven biochemical tests: production of acid from inositol,  sucrose and xylose; rapid or delayed production of acid from sorbitol; gelatin liquefaction; and production of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. with a set of eight typing antisera for s. faecalis, 15 strains were non-typable, 12 were serotype 1 and three were serotype 19. with a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for s. faecalis, all of the oral isolates were typable; 40% were lysotype i1 and the remainder lysotype v6b. on the basis of biotype-serotype-phage-type combinations, indications of possible spread of strains between haemodialysis patients and dialysis unit staff were obtained. biotyping and serotyping of 13 german isolates of s. faecalis of phage type i1 from four clinical sources and tripartite typing of three control strains provided additional evidence for the potential of biotyping in distinguishing between strains of identical serotype and phage type. one oral isolate of s. faecium was of phage type xx. none of the oral isolates of s. faecalis, of which  14 exhibited delayed sorbitol fermentation, reacted with group-g streptococcal grouping reagents or antiserum. slow sorbitol fermentation does not appear to be  a definitive phenotypic marker for s. faecalis strains possessing antigens that react with both group-d and group-g grouping reagents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic ly146032 was generally four-fold greater (mic 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus. enterococci, streptococcus bovis, group b and viridans streptococci, and corynebacterium group j-k isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of ly146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. unlike vancomycin, ly146032 was bactericidal for enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and listeria monocytogenes. due to its bactericidal properties ly146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.

AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == bactericidal activity of netilmicin compared with gentamicin and streptomycin, alone and in combination with penicillin, against penicillin tolerant viridans streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of s. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. the results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and s. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of s. faecium tested.

AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == transferable resistance and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterococci.
AB  == ten isolates of streptococcus faecalis and two isolates of s. faecium were studied together with an nctc strain of each species. antibiotic susceptibility tests showed different patterns of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. three s. faecalis strains were highly resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. by means of a filter membrane technique, transfer of high-level  resistance to aminoglycosides was demonstrated from s. faecalis to s. faecalis, from s. faecium to s. faecalis and from s. faecalis to s. faecium, the last of which has not previously been described. aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were assayed with radiolabelled cofactors. high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides could be attributed to the production of 2''-o-phosphotransferases, 3'-o-phosphotransferases, 6-o-adenylyltransferases and 6'-n-acetyltransferases. other resistance mechanisms accounted for resistance in  two strains of s. faecalis and one strain of s. faecium that were highly resistant only to streptomycin and one s. faecalis strain that was moderately resistant to all aminoglycosides. a low level of 6'-n-acetyltransferases was detected in the three strains of s. faecium but this did not confer high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and this trait could not be transferred.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

AB  == the in vitro activities of trimethoprim (tmp), alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole (smx), against 131 clinical isolates of enterococci, 126 streptococcus faecalis isolates, and 5 streptococcus faecium isolates were determined by a broth microdilution method with mueller-hinton broth that was substantially free of inhibitory substances. the geometric mean mic of tmp for strains of s. faecalis was 0.164 micrograms/ml (range, 0.03 to 8 micrograms/ml),  with a geometric mean mbc of 0.298 micrograms/ml (range, 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml). although all strains were resistant to the sulfonamide alone, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of tmp against strains of s. faecalis were markedly potentiated when tmp was combined in a fixed ratio of 1:19 with smx; the geometric mean mic of tmp was reduced to 0.016 micrograms/ml (range, 0.002 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean mbc of 0.031 micrograms/ml (range, 0.004 to 0.25 micrograms/ml). the combination had no synergistic effect against strains of s. faecium; the geometric mean mics and mbcs of both agents were ca. 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mbc/mic ratios for tmp and tmp-smx were less than or equal to 16 for all 131 strains. mics and mbcs for tmp-smx were unchanged, and for tmp they decreased when performed in broth supplemented with 50% heat-inactivated pooled human serum. for tmp and tmp-smx, the susceptibilities of isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin were the same as those of isolates susceptible to less than or equal to 2,000 micrograms of aminoglycoside per ml. these results suggest that tmp-smx and tmp alone could prove useful in the treatment of serious enterococcal infections, including infections by strains with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.

TI  == gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  == the recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. the summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. ceftazidime or  moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. the most common pathogens for the above drugs were the  fungi (candida spp.), pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcal, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. the reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor  and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. the most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp. and  fungi. cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric streptococcus spp. (streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium).

AB  == a fecal isolate, streptococcus sp. strain frp-17, and strain vgh-1 of streptococcus faecium were shown to contain beta-glucosidases which converted rutin (quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose-alpha-l-rhamnose) to quercetin and were active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose. the activity against rutin could be  measured by increased mutagenicity in the ames assay or visualized on thin-layer  chromatography plates. in both organisms, the beta-glucosidase activities were inducible by the addition of rutin to the growth media. several closely related strains of streptococcus spp. lacked any beta-glucosidase activity. in cell preparations of the active organisms, activities with rutin and o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose were optimal at ph 6.8 and could be enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the assay system. at low ionic strengths, both quercetin and a new product (intermediate between the polarities of rutin and quercetin) were formed by the incubation of rutin with cell preparations of either active organism. this product disappeared with increased ionic strength, suggesting that it may be a reaction intermediate, quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose.  these results suggest that the beta-glucosidase active against rutin and that active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose are the same.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall, their susceptibilities to six antibiotics and a comparison with clinical isolates.
AB  == isolates of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. from below  the sewer outfall, streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, s. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. s. faecalis var. faecalis, s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where s. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. s. faecium and s. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. the use of group d streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. a statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to  which no resistance was detected. multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the  environmental isolates. even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == medium-dependent zone size discrepancies associated with susceptibility testing of group d streptococci against various cephalosporins.
AB  == mueller-hinton (mh) agar media from various commercial sources, either supplemented or not supplemented with 5% sheep blood, were studied to determine their effect on disk diffusion susceptibility testing results obtained with 90 strains of group d streptococci and four cephalosporins. the cephalosporins investigated included cephalothin, cefamandole, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. results showed that a number of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium  strains were susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime, but the number varied with both the commercial source and blood content of the mh medium  used. regardless of the mh medium used, none of the s. faecalis or s. faecium strains were found to be susceptible to moxalactam. the apparently medium-associated variations in the number of strains susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime were largely due to minor discrepancies (one result being intermediate) among the various types of mh media used. however, major discrepancies (one result being resistant and the other susceptible or vice versa) were observed when s. faecalis strains were tested against cefotaxime. these major discrepancies were associated with both the commercial source of the  mh medium and the blood content of the medium.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system have been synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities. these compounds, n-[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (3) and n-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl) methyl]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (4), were synthesized by reacting the appropriately substituted alpha-halo ketones with 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2). elaboration of p-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (5) to p-carbomethoxyphenacyl bromide (7) was accomplished by its oxidation with jones reagent and the successive treatment of  the oxidation product with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. commercially available p-vinylbenzoic acid (11) was converted to its glutamate conjugate 12 and was further converted to the bromo ketone, diethyl n-[p-(1-bromo-2-oxopropyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamate (17), by a series of reactions involving epoxidation, oxirane ring opening with hbr, jones oxidation, zn/hoac reduction, and successive treatment of the reduction product 16 with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. these bromo ketones, 7 and 17, upon reaction with pyrimidine 2, gave the diethyl esters of the target compounds, which were hydrolyzed to 3 and 4 with naoh. compound 4 underwent an interesting acid-catalyzed isomerization where the double bond of 4 was shifted from the 5,6-position to the 6,9-position to give the isomer 19. both compounds 3 and 4 were inactive against lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469) and did not serve as synthetic substrates of l. casei dihydrofolate reductase. compound 4 showed activity against streptococcus faecium (atcc 8043), but 3 was inactive against this organism.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefathiamidine against streptococcus faecalis and str. faecium were studied in comparison with other beta-lactams. all the 56 strains of str. faecalis tested were inhibited by 2 mg/l of cefathiamidine. mics of ampicillin were twofold higher than those of cefathiamidine and mics of cephaloridine and cephazolin were 8-16-fold higher. no significant inoculum effect on mics of cefathiamidine could be seen. two isolates of str. faecium showed resistance to the four antibiotics. the mbcs of cefathiamidine and ampicillin for ten strains of str. faecalis showed that the ratios of mbc/mic were greater than 64. the rates of killing of str. faecalis were reduced at concentrations of cefathiamidine and ampicillin greater than the mic. the most rapid killing was obtained at 2 mg/l cefathiamidine or 4 mg/l of ampicillin. with the addition of 1 mg/l gentamicin this paradoxical bacteriocidal effect was eliminated. time killing studies showed 99.9% of the cells were killed within 6 h by a combination of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. the paradoxical bacteriocidal effect of cefathiamidine and ampicillin was also demonstrated on solid media.

TI  == studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group d streptococci.
AB  == six penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group d streptococci: streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis and s. faecium. when examined in whole organisms, the pbps of s. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group d streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of s. faecalis (intermediate penicillin  resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of s. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). on the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one pbp or group of pbps, and the penicillin mic value for the corresponding micro-organism. examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to pbps of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of s. faecalis and s. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these  species. the lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group d streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size pbps of these bacteria.

AB  == the rules of the european economic community to harmonize the hygienic quality of drinking water write out the faecal streptococci as indicator organisms. this operating definition of the faecal streptococci prohibits its taxonomic limitation to enterococci or group d streptococci. therefore, we have undertaken  studies concerning the methods for routine examinations. comparative investigations of selective enrichment broths showed no significant differences of the end concentration of glucose in the range of 0.5-1.0% and of sodium azide  in the range of 0.02-0.05%. 36 degrees c was a better incubation temperature than 44 degrees c and the results were better after 24 h than after 48 h. comparative  investigations of selective plating media showed less selectivity of the bile-aesculin agar and gentamicinthallous-carbonate agar than that on the one hand of citrate-azide-tween-carbonate agar, kf streptococcal agar or slanetz-bartley enterococcal agar, and on the other hand of kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar. all together the kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar seems to be a little better than the other media (table 2) 356 strains of faecal  streptococci were isolated from the studied media. more than 20 characteristics were investigated and, there upon, the strains were differentiated (table 3). s.  faecalis predominates in human materials, i.e. urine, s. faecium and s. durans were isolated specially from sewage and waste water (table 4). the single species of faecal streptococci grow specificly on the different selective media, and therefore, each agar specimen prefers the one or other species more or less selectively (table 5).

AB  == in accordance with previous papers published within a series of publications which describe the results obtained from the central laboratory for streptococcal research in kiel (1. survey, 2. mastitis-streptococci) the group of enterococci is discussed herewith. on the basis of more than 6000 strains which are stored in our databank including all biological characteristics, the distribution of the cultural, biochemical and serological parameters is listed in percentages, and the usefulness and reliability for the identification of the enterococcal group and also the differentiation of particular species is discussed. the results are  tabulated for every single species and additionally, for serologic-positive and negative strains. for example, it can be shown that a third of all str. faecium strains are motile, that lack of growth at 45 degrees c varies between 1.1% and 31.3% and that lack of serological reaction with group d-serum between 0.9% and 70%. in a comprehensive table and flow diagram these figures result in a proposal for a simple but sufficient identification procedure on different stages (enterococci, faecalis- or faecium-group, single species) depending on the individual requirements. with regard to the incidence of enterococci in man and animals, which was presented in the first paper, the organ sources of the different species are compared now. apart from some interesting findings it can be stated that a typical predominance of the faecalis and faecium-group resp. in  man or animals cannot be confirmed. but there seems to be a relation between the  species and the organ source. for example, in humans the faecium-group predominates in the respiratory tract, but in the urogenital tract the presence of str. faecalis is seven times higher than the faecium-group. the above results  may also be of interest for ecological reasons and may be important for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this streptococcal group.

TI  == species-specific resistance to antimocrobial synergism in streptococcus faecium and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == combinations of penicillin with various aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols were tested against a collection of clinical isolates of streptococcus faecium in vitro and were used to treat endocarditis caused by s. faecium in the rabbit model. s. faecium proved more resistant to penicillin than streptococcus faecalis. even more striking, however, was the resistance to in vitro synergism by combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides. at clinically achievable concentrations, penicillin-gentamicin was the only combination that was synergistic against all strains that were tested. combinations of penicillin  and streptomycin and penicillin and amikacin were synergistic only against those  strains that were not highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively. combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, or netilmicin failed to produce synergism against any of these strains. the possible clinical significance of these findings was verified by use of the rabbit model of endocarditis. combinations of penicillin with gentamicin or streptomycin were synergistic in the therapy of endocarditis that was produced by a strain of s. faecium that did not have a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides. however, the combination of penicillin and netilmicin was no more effective than penicillin alone.

TI  == release of autolytic enzyme from streptococcus, faecium cell walls by treatment with dilute alkali.
AB  == the autolytic enzyme (endo-beta-1,4-n-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) was released in a soluble form from insoluble cell wall-autolytic enzyme complexes by treatment with dilute naoh at 0 degree c. treatment of cell wall-enzyme complexes, obtained from either exponential- or stationary-phase cells, with 0.008 to 0.01 n naoh gave maximum yields of autolytic enzyme activity. at a fixed concentration of naoh, the yield of autolysin increased with increasing wall densities and was accompanied by the release of methylpentose and phosphorus in amounts proportional to the autolysin. since extraction of wall-enzyme complexes with 4.5 m licl at 0 degree c also removed methylpentose and phosphorus, release of enzyme with naoh did not appear  to result from hydrolysis of covalent linkages. the autolytic enzyme activity released from intact cells, or cell walls, was predominantly in the later (proteinase activable) form which could be activated by trypsin or a proteinase present in commerical bovine plasma albumin.

AB  == the effect of lactic acid fermentation in bulgarian yoghourt was studied by the development and decline of hygiene level indicating microorganisms--enterococci and coli-bacteriae. it was established that for the first 6 h after production of bulgarian yoghourt, the quantity of enterococci (str. faecalis, resp. str. faecium) increases 5--6 times on the average, after the 12th hour it begins slowly to decrease and the number is reduced two times during storage for 7 days  at 7--10 degrees c temperature of 6 days at 18--22 degrees c. the reduction in enterococci number is not fully correlated with the stage of lactic acid fermentation. coli-bacteriae (e. coli) do not grow in number at the time the milk is turned into yoghourt. their initial quantity diminishes along with the advance of the lactic acid process and after 24 h of milk storage at 18--22 degrees c or  after 48 h at 7--10 degrees c they cannot be detected at all. the conclusion is drawn that enterococci are more suitable as hygiene level indicating microorganisms for hygienic evaluation of bulgarian yoghourt, as compared to coli-bacteriae, due to their greater viability and longer survival in the product at the time of its production and during storage. it is recommended to perform the investigations on coli-forms not later than the 24th hour after yoghourt productions begins.

TI  == approximation of the cell cycle in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == slowly growing populations (td = 70 to 80 min) of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) were synchronized by selection after sucrose gradient fractionation. the cell cycle was approximated by correlating the patterns of dna accumulation and cell division. more specifically, the beginning of cell cycle was equated with the beginning of a rapid linear increase in dna accumulation. the dna content of the culture approximately doubled during the period of accumulation, which lasted about 51 min. the period of rapid dna accumulation, was followed by a period of reduced accumulation that lasted about 24 min. during synchronized growth, cell numbers increased rapidly in coordination with the period of rapid dna accumulation and exhibited a plateau during the period of reduced dna accumulation. in contrast, rna and protein appeared to accumulate exponentially throughout the cell cycle at the same rate as culture mass.

TI  == relationship between cellular autolytic activity, peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and the cell cycle in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == synchronized, slowly growing (td = 70 to 80 min) cultures were used to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. the rate of peptidoglycan  synthesis per cell declined during most of the period of chromosome replication (c), but increased during the latter part of c and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (d). an increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of c, reached a maximum late in c or early in d, and declined during d. inhibition of dna synthesis during c prevented the decline in autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed  but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. inhibition of dna synthesis during d did not prevent  the increase in autolytic capacity during the next c phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related  to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the  cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. the data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed  model for cell division of s. faecium (g.d. shockman et al., ann. n.y acad. sci.  235:161-197, 1974).

TI  == plasmid-mediated mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics and to chloramphenicol in group d streptococci.
AB  == genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics in three  group d streptococcal strains, streptococcus faecalis jh1 and jh6 and s. faecium  jh7, and to chloramphenicol in jh6 are carried by plasmids that can transfer to other s. faecalis cells. the aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase enzymes that have substrate profiles very similar to those of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases found in gram-negative bacteria. phosphorylation probably occurs at the aminoglycoside 3'-hydroxyl group. plasmid-borne streptomycin resistance is due to production of  the enzyme streptomycin adenylyltransferase, which, as in staphylococci and in contrast to that detected in gram-negative bacteria, is less effective against spectinomycin as substrate. resistance to chloramphenicol is by enzymatic acetylation. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is inducible and bears a close resemblance to the type d chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variant from staphylococci.

TI  == cellular autolytic activity in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == the autolytic capacity of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) varied during synchronous cell division. this phenomenon was initially observed in rapidly dividing populations (td=30 to 33 min) synchronized by a combination of induction and size selection techniques. to minimize the problems inherent in studies of cells containing overlapping chromosome cycles and possible artifacts  generated by induction techniques, the autolytic capacities of slowly dividing populations (td=60 to 110 min) synchronized by selection only were examined. although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. on the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic capacity of cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of dna synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated.

TI  == generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  == potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. this applies to all investigated vehicles. however, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. this is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like streptococcus bovis, str.  faecium, and str. durans. again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. on the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than  either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. yet, sodium azide  may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, streptococcus species, and age of pollution. a lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. this applied to water and milk examination.

AB  == a method has been developed by which to study the sorption of streptococcus faecium to soda-lime cover glasses. conditions were chosen to minimize the influence on sorption of bacterial polymer production, passive sorption being studied rather than attachment mediated by metabolic activities. sorption of s. faecium increased with increasing temperature (to 50 degrees c), time, and cell concentration, but equilibrium apparently was not reached even after incubation for 8 hours or at a cell concentration of 3 x 10(10) per ml. sorption increased with solute molarity up to 0.1 m concentration of nacl and kcl, indicating an effect of the electrical double layers on the apposition of cells to the glass surface. desorption of bacteria could be obtained after multiple washings of the  glasses in buffer or by the action of tween 80, but not if sorbed bacteria were left in distilled water, various salt solutions, urea, or in suspensions of unlabelled bacteria. it was concluded that sorption occurred as a result of chemical interactions between the glass and the cell surface. tween 80 at a concentration of 1 per cent inhibited sorption to 26 per cent of buffer controls, 2 m urea was less effective, and 1 m nacl was without effect. it is suggested that hydrophobic interactions may be of importance in the binding of s. faecium to glass.

AB  == a series of methotrexate (mtx) analogs was prepared in which the glutamic acid moiety is replaced by various amino acid esters and amines. the synthetic method  consisted of the reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-n10-methylpteroic acid with various  reagents to form intermediate mixed anhydrides, which then reacted with amino acid esters or amines to give the mtx analogs. these compounds were tested for antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecium and for antitumor activity against l1210 leukemia in mice. several compounds showed significant antibacterial activity; the mtx homocysteinethiolactone and mtx aspartate analogs showed marginal in vivo antitumor activity.

TI  == synthesis and biological activity of 5-fluoro-4'-thiouridine and some related nucleosides.
AB  == the synthesis of a series of 4'-thio-5-halogenopyrimidine nucleosides, including  the 5-fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives, has been carried out by condensation of the 2,4-bis-o-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the corresponding pyrimidine bases with the protected 4-thio-d-ribofuranosyl chloride. among these, the alpha and beta anomers of 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine inhibited the growth of leukemia l1210 cells at concentrations of 4 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) m, respectively, and that of s. faecium at 4 x 10(-9) and 6 x 10(-10) m, respectively. these compounds retained marked activity against strains of s. faecium resistant to 10(-3) m 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouridine. as determined in s. faecium cultures, 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine decreased the total protein content  of the cells more markedly than it did their rna or dna content. x-ray crystallography showed that substitution of sulfur for the oxygen in the carbohydrate ring markedly changes the conformation of that moiety.

TI  == synthesis and excretion of glycerol teichoic acid during growth of two streptococcal species.
AB  == examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of streptococcus mutans strain fa-1 and  streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 (s. faecium) showed the presence of [-3h]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. in the supernatant medium of s. mutans fa-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with  the kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. in contrast, with s. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. the presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.

TI  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride: metabolism and function as an anchor in bacterial cell membrane.
AB  == the recently discovered phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride (pkd), was first observed as a biosynthetic by-product of glycosyl diglyceride metabolism in streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790. its structure is 1, 2-diacyl-3-o-alpha-dglucopyranosyl-6'-o-phosphoryl- [1'', 2''-diacyl-3''-o-sn-glycerol]-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol. the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride occurs by a novel transphosphatidylation reaction in which a phosphatidyl glycerol to the primary alcohol function at the 6 position of the internal glucose of kojibiosyl diglyceride. the reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-derived enzyme. phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride is bound covalently through a phosphodiester  bond to the polyglycerol phosphate moiety of membrane lipoteichoic acid from s. faecalis. phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride has four nonpolar long chain fatty acyl groups and appears to have the necessary physico-chemical properties to anchor the long hydrophilic glycerol phosphate polymer of lipoteichoic acid to the hydrophobic enviroment of the membrane of s. faecalis and probably other gram-positive bacteria as well.

TI  == the structure of dihydrofolate reductase. identification of methionine residues carboxymethylated by iodoacetate with loss of catalytic activity.
AB  == dihydrofolate reductase from the amethopterin-resistant mutant (strain a) of streptococcus faecium var. durans was reacted with iodo[14c]acetate according to  three procedures; (a) in the absence of an inhibitor, (b) in the presence of aminopterin, and (c) in absence of inhibitor, but after treatment with unlabeled  iodoacetate in presence of aminopterin. the first and last procedures resulted in the loss of approximately 90% of the catalytic activity, whereas in the presence  of aminopterin essentially no activity was lost. peptides were produced from all  three labeled proteins by tryptic digestion after citraconylation of the lysine residues. from the amino acid compositions and partial amino acid sequences of these peptides the position of all modified methionines in the sequence was determined. the extent of labeling at each methionine, in enzyme labeled in the different procedures, indicated that methionines 28 and 50 may be at the binding  site for inhibitors and that residue 50 is less accessible to iodoacetate than is residue 28. it is likely that carboxymethylation of residue 28 is responsible for the loss of enzyme activity.

TI  == synthesis of n-10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid and related compounds.
AB  == compound 21 (n10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid) and related compounds were prepared as  potential inhibitors of the cofactor forms of tetrahydrofolate. the preparation of 2-acetylamino-4-(benzylthio)-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) provided an intermediate that was allowed to react with methyl p-[(3-aminoacetonyl)methylamino]benzoate oxime (16). the oxime function of the resulting 6-substituted aminopyrimidine 6 was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acetonylaminopyrimidine 7, which on reductive cyclization gave methyl p-[[[2-amino-4-(benzylthio)-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl]methyl]methylamino]benzoate  (9). this dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (n10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13).  displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. after protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl l-glutamate. the product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. the title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of streptococcus faecium atcc 8043. however, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the kb cell culture screen or against l1210 leukemia cells in mice.

AB  == combinations of cephalothin and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not currently used in the therapy of serious enterococcal infections, because clinical trials of these combinations have been unsuccessful. studies of 28 enterococci isolated from patients with enterococcal bacteremia suggested three possible mechanisms for this in vivo antibiotic failure: (i) a relatively high level of resistance to cephalothin among all enterococci and especially those characterized as streptococcus faecium, (ii) a significant incidence of high-level resistance to the aminoglycosides among certain strains of enterococci, and (iii) a failure of  synergism to occur when cephalothin concentrations fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the enterococcus, as occurs during the in vivo metabolism and excretion of this antibiotic when given in standard doses for endocarditis.

TI  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride. the covalently linked lipid constituent of the membrane lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790.
AB  == water-soluble [14c]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane  preparations of streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid i). depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid i  accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14c-labeled lipids released. more stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid i and increased the quantity of the other lipids. lipid i on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. the other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. these lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. these and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of s. faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride.

AB  == the study was performed on 612 routine cultures of material obtained from root canals of teeth at the time of filling (r-cultures) by students at the department of endodontics during a continuous period of one year. twenty-nine isolates from  27 (29.3%) of the 92 positive cultures filled the criteria of enterococci (sherman, 1937) and had demonstrable group d-antigen. with a set of tests these isolates were identified as follows: strep. faecalis subsp. faecalis (10), strep. faecalis subsp. zymogenes (3), strep. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens (8), atypical  variants of strep. faecalis (6), strep. faecium var. faecium (1) and strep. faecium var. durans (1). five tests in the present study clearly differentiated strep. faecalis from strep. faecium i.e. fermentation of sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobic) and melezitose, tolerance to potassium tellurite (0.1%) (positive for strep. faecalis) and production of hydrogen peroxide (positive for strep. faecium). in the inocula 10(3) or more colony forming units of enterococci were found more often of other identified microorganisms. this means that enterococci  are of special interest in studies on the influence of infection at the time of filling of root canals on the prognosis of root canal therapy. the isolates were  also tested for susceptibility to azidocillin, ampicillin, penicillin-g, penicillin-v and erythromycin with the paper disc method. all the isolates were susceptible to azidocillin and ampicillin (sensitivity group i), while the majority of the isolates showed a lower susceptibility to the other three antibiotics (sensitivity group ii). the significance of these findings in the choice of prophylactic antibiotic to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease are discussed, when bacteremia from dental procedures may be expected.

AB  == rogosa broth, without its salt supplement and dissolved in deionized water, was adapted for the selective isolation and enumeration of enterococci. this medium supported good growth of enterococci, but it suppressed growth of other lactic acid bacteria. the sensitivity and specificity of the medium were tested after addition of various increasing concentrations of nan(3) against known strains of  enterococci and other bacteria. many strains of streptococcus faecium showed low  azide tolerance; optimal growth was obtained at a concentration of 0.01% nan(3),  which totally or partially inhibited unrelated species of lactic acid bacteria. the selectivity of the medium was further increased by ph adjustment to 9.6. carbonate and tween 80 were added to overcome partial inhibition of enterococcal  growth by the new combination of selective conditions. the final medium was evaluated in agar form in isolations from human and animal feces, polluted water, meat, and dairy products. counts were obtained after 16 to 17 h of incubation at  37 c. the isolates satisfactorily conformed to the group characteristics of enterococci.

TI  == growth of streptococcus faecium in the presence of lysozyme.
AB  == streptococcus faecium can grow normally in the presence of lysozyme, despite the  observation that cell suspensions of the organism are lysed readily by the enzyme. growth in the presence of lysozyme is not due to resistant cells, and the culture is lysed after growth if the ph of the medium is not allowed to drop too  low for lysozyme activity. growth followed by lysis in the presence of lysozyme was not exhibited by other organisms tested which were either significantly more  resistant or more sensitive to lysozyme than s. faecium. lysozyme was active on the cell wall of s. faecium during growth in the presence of 200 mug of the enzyme per ml in a complex medium. it appears that, when actively metabolizing, s. faecium can synthesize the cell wall at a greater rate than lysozyme can hydrolyze it. thus, the organism is capable of growth in the presence of the enzyme. a large variation in the lytic responses of enterococcal cell suspensions to lysozyme was dependent on the strain used, the growth phase from which the culture was harvested, and the medium in which the culture was grown.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.

TI  == isolation and identification of enterococci from the intestinal tract of the rat.
AB  == rogers, c. g. (department of national health and welfare, ottawa, ontario, canada), and w. b. sarles. isolation and identification of enterococci from the intestinal tract of the rat. j. bacteriol. 88:965-973. 1964.-surface inoculation  was employed in a comparison of three selective media, m-enterococcus (m) agar, thallium acetate-glucose (titg) agar, and kf-streptococcus (kf) agar, for enumeration and isolation of enterococci from contents of the digestive tract of  the rat. similar yields of enterococcus colonies were obtained with m, titg, and  kf agar. when cecal contents were examined, species identification of 120 isolates, 40 from each medium, revealed only minor differences in selective activity. streptococcus faecalis and its variety zymogenes represented 55 to 63%  of the isolates from each medium; the remaining strains resembled s. durans or s. faecium. more than 99% of the isolates failed to survive the heat-tellurite tolerance test. periodic analyses of intestinal contents from young rats indicated that enterococci became established in the gut from 10 to 14 days after birth. the species isolated most frequently on m agar was s. faecalis var. zymogenes. when rats were fed a purified diet with casein as the source of nitrogen, s. faecalis var. zymogenes predominated among isolates from contents of the small intestine plated on m agar. this species was largely replaced by others resembling s. durans or s. faecium when mixtures of l-amino acids provided the dietary nitrogen. nineteen enterococcus isolates, representing all that met the sherman criteria, required arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, and valine; of these, two strains required in addition threonine, glycine, and lysine; four required threonine and glycine; two, threonine and lysine; and one, threonine.

(american meat institute foundation, chicago, ill.), and m. j. kvetkas. fumarate reduction and its role in the diversion of glucose fermentation by streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 88:858-864. 1964.-fumarate diverts the normal fermentation of glucose by streptococcus faecalis fb82, as shown by the production of increased amounts of co(2), formate, acetate, and acetoin, and decreased formation of lactate and ethanol. experiments with d-glucose-1-c(14), in which low levels of labeled co(2) were recovered, indicated that c-1 cleavage  of the glucose molecule was not involved. the presence of fumarate afforded consistently larger cell crops in growth studies with glucose and other energy sources. on a molar growth-yield basis, anaerobically grown, glucose-fumarate cultures were equivalent to aerobically grown, glucose cultures. the reduction of fumarate by cell suspensions indicated that glucose, gluconate, and, to a lesser  extent, glycerol and mannitol could serve as hydrogen donors. several common metabolic inhibitors had no effect upon the fumarate reductase system in cell suspensions, although some sensitivity to acidic ph was noted. significant levels of succinate oxidation activity were not detected. fumarate reductase activity was demonstrated in all five s. faecalis strains tested. distribution of this ability in s. faecium strains was variable, ranging from activity comparable with that of s. faecalis to total inactivity. the observations support the conclusion  that fumarate functions as an alternate hydrogen acceptor, thus allowing pyruvate to participate in the energy-yielding phosphoroclastic and dismutation pathways.

AB  == deibel, r. h. (american meat institute foundation, chicago, ill.), and c. f. niven, jr. pyruvate fermentation by streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 88:4-10. 1964.-streptococcus faecalis, as opposed to s. faecium, utilizes pyruvate as an energy source for growth. the fermentation is adaptive, as demonstrated by growth experiments in a casein-hydrolysate medium and the fermentation of pyruvate by cell suspensions. the principal products of pyruvate  catabolism were acetoin, co(2), and lactic, acetic, and formic acids, although carbon recoveries were low due to the formation of slime. end-product analyses suggested that both the phosphoroclastic and dismutation systems were active in pyruvate breakdown. studies with cell-free extracts indicated a thiamine diphosphate requirement for active pyruvate catabolism. the involvement of lipoic acid in the phosphoroclastic system was investigated, and, although inconclusive  results were obtained, no association of this cofactor with phosphoroclastic activity could be made.

(indiana university, bloomington). host range of certain virulent and temperate bacteriophages attacking group d streptococci. j. bacteriol. 88:165-171. 1964.-host range studies with five bacteriophages isolated from sewage showed that a high degree of strain specificity occurred among the species streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis var. zymogenes, and s. faecalis var.  liquefaciens. certain phages were able to attack various members of these subgroups but not other members. a high degree of strain specificity was also found with respect to eight phages attacking strains of s. faecium. many strains  of this latter group were resistant to all the phages available. the only firm conclusion was that no phage attacked both s. faecium and s. faecalis strains. in several selected strains of the s. faecalis-liquefaciens-zymogenes group, resistance to several virulent phages seemed to be related to the presence of certain prophages in these strains. a search for transduction with the temperate  phages was unsuccessful. mutants of s. faecium 8043 resistant to certain growth-factor analogues showed unpredictable changes in resistance and sensitivity to two virulent phages.

AB  == deibel, r. h. (american meat institute foundation, chicago, ill.). utilization of arginine as an energy source for the growth of streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 87:988-992. 1964.-although both streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium  (and its variety durans) hydrolyze arginine, the utilization of this amino acid as an energy source appears to have taxonomic utility, as only s. faecalis and its varieties can couple the resultant energy with growth processes. utilization  of arginine by s. faecalis in a semisynthetic, casein-hydrolysate medium requires small concentrations of a fermentable carbohydrate (0.05%), presumably for synthetic reactions. the arginine analogue, agmatine, is utilized as an energy source by s. faecalis but not by s. faecium, and only approxinately 50% of the latter strains hydrolyzed this compound. other ureido- and guanido-containing compounds tested were neither utilized as an energy source nor deaminated.

(american meat institute foundation, chicago, ill.), donald e. lake, and c. f. niven, jr. physiology of the enterococci as related to their taxonomy. j. bacteriol. 86:1275-1282. 1963-studies on a collection of enterococci isolated from diverse sources have confirmed the existence of two distinct species, namely, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. in contrast with s. faecium, s. faecalis characteristically ferments melezitose, sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobically), citrate, and gluconate; fails to ferment arabinose and  melibiose; has strong reducing capacities as demonstrated by prompt reduction of  litmus in milk or tetrazolium in an agar medium; initiates growth on an agar medium containing 0.04% potassium tellurite; does not require folic acid for growth; and does not produce strong greening in blood agar. s. liquefaciens and s. zymogenes differ from s. faecalis only in their proteolytic capacities and, therefore, deserve only varietal status. some s. faecalis and s. faecium strains  are proteolytic when tested on agar media. s. durans differs from s. faecium only in its inability to ferment arabinose and mannitol, and the failure of most strains to ferment sucrose. therefore, it should be considered as a variety of s. faecium. it is recommended that the term "enterococcus" be used only when referring to s. faecalis and s. faecium, and their respective varieties.

AB  == brock, thomas d. (indiana university, bloomington), barbara peacher, and deborah  pierson. a survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. j. bacteriol. 86:702-707.  1963.-a survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group d streptococci. on the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. type 1 is produced by all streptococcus zymogenes (s. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. type 2 is produced by some s. liquefaciens (s. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. type 3 is produced  by certain strains of both s. faecalis and s. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group d streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except leuconostoc citrovorum. type 4 is produced by certain s. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of s. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. the strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. no strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.

TI  == occurrence of enterococci on plants in a wild environment.
AB  == enterococci were obtained from 14% of nearly 2,200 flowers, 3.4% of non-floral structures of angiosperms, and from 8.3% of samples of soil, water, and lesser plants of the great smoky mountains national park, an area little influenced by the presence of man. the enterococci were recovered from one or more flowers or flower clusters of 1,515 samples in 47 taxa, but not from flowers of 67 taxa with 654 samples. the per cent of recovery was influenced adversely by dense forest cover and by increase in elevation, as compared with recovery from flowers in sunny locations in the lower elevations. the per cent recovery increased directly with rising seasonal temperature, with the maximal per cent of recovery occurring in september. in no instance did all samples of a species of flower or plant yield enterococci on culture, and with only three genera, cacalia, delphinium, and mitchella, were the bacteria obtained from more than 50% of the samples. approximately 11% of the cultures isolated were identified as streptococcus faecalis, 64% as the soft curd producing, caseolytic variant of s. faecalis, 4% as s. faecalis var. zymogenes, and 20% as s. faecium. the per cent distribution of these species on plants was reasonably similar to the distribution within wild animals in the same environment. it was concluded that the enterococci occurring  on plants arise commonly from the wild animals, and that they do not represent plant-specific species or variants of the enterococci.

TI  == occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment.
AB  == enterococci were obtained from the feces of 71% of 216 mammals, 86% of 70 reptiles, and 32% of 22 birds sampled in a truly wild environment, the great smoky mountains national park. patterns of food dependence and also of species dependence were observed. among the lower classes of the primarily herbivorous mammals, the enterococci occurred sporadically; however, of the six species of sciuridae, the gray squirrel, and of four species of cricetidae, the red-backed mouse, the enterococci appear to be natural hosts. the enterococci were not obtained from most specimens of moles, shrews, or rabbits but they were obtained  from most specimens of bats and from the carnivorous mammals, such as fox, bear,  raccon, skunk, and boar. streptococcus faecalis was obtained from 12 reptiles, and a caseolytic variant was obtained from 37 specimens of the reptiles. the strongly reducing, tellurite-tolerant species, s. faecalis, its caseolytic variant, and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were isolated from 127 or 41% of 308 specimens cultured. s. faecium was recovered from 87 or 28% of the animals, chiefly from the wild boar (60 of 64 trials) and the black bear. s. zymogenes was obtained from 1 of 31 bats, 3 of 12 raccoons, and 1 of 3 owls.
