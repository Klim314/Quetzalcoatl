TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == inflammatory events as detected in cervical smears and squamous intraepithelial lesions.
AB  == the dutch cytological coding system, kopac, enables to code for eight inflammatory events, that is koilocytosis (related to human papillomavirus (hpv)), trichomonas, dysbacteriosis [related to bacterial vaginosis (bv)], candida, gardnerella, actinomyces, chlamydia, and non-specific inflammation (leucocytosis). this study presents an analysis of 1,008,879 smears. of each smear, the age of the woman and the reason for smear taking (screening or indication) was available. the cytoscores (per mille) for these codes were calculated. for the screening smears, the cytoscores were for koilocytosis (hpv)  2.6, for trichomonas vaginalis 1.9, for dysbacteriosis 31.4, for candida albicans 9.8, for gardnerella vaginalis 0.7, for actinomyces 6.9, for chlamydia 0.8, and for non-specific inflammatory changes 66.4. for the calculation of the odds ratio (or), normal smears were used as a reference. the cytoscores for chlamydia and gardnerella covaried with high grade sil (hsil), with an or of 7 and 12, respectively. in addition, the or for trichomonas vaginalis, for dysbacteriosis,  and for leucocytosis proved to be significantly high in the indication smears. this study provides an oversight of hsil and the full range of cervical infections as detected by cytology, proving that this infectious byproduct of screening can be very valuable.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == characterization of actinomyces turicensis and actinomyces radingae strains from  human clinical samples.
AB  == whole-organism protein electrophoresis was used to compare and group unidentified coryneform bacteria resembling gardnerella vaginalis and various actinomyces and  arcanobacterium species. the obtained clusters of strains were further characterized by whole-cell fatty acid analysis and a variety of biochemical tests. species-specific oligonucleotide probes based on 16s rrna gene sequences were designed. the results demonstrate that the majority of the isolates belonged to actinomyces turicensis; the other strains belonged to actinomyces radingae. the descriptions of both species are emended.

TI  == polyphasic approach to the classification and identification of gardnerella vaginalis and unidentified gardnerella vaginalis-like coryneforms present in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a taxonomic study of gardnerella vaginalis and g. vaginalis-like coryneforms was  performed in order to clarify the phylogenetic affiliation of these organisms and to improve future identification. we examined 50 strains by performing whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses, a 16s rrna sequence analysis, and an extensive phenotypic characterization analysis. the results of both chemotaxonomic techniques which we used divided the organisms into two main clusters, and the 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed that the clusters represent different genera, which were easily distinguished by the results of classical phenotypic tests. the cluster i strains were identified as g. vaginalis, which was shown to be a close  relative of the genus bifidobacterium. an improved description of g. vaginalis is presented. the cluster ii strains belong to or are closely related to actinomyces turicensis.

TI  == epidemiologic differences between candidial and trichomonal infections as detected in cytologic smears in taiwan.
AB  == the epidemiologic differences between cytology-detected candidial and trichomonal infections were assessed in 15,933 women attending the 12 district health centres in the taipei area and a consecutive 1114 patients, visiting venereal disease clinics, whose smears were screened for cervical cancer between july 1991 and december 1992 in taipei. the pap smears were examined for the presence of specific organisms, such as trichomonas vaginalis, vaginal candida, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, actinomyces, leptothrix, aspergillu, gardnerella and others. more emphasis was placed on the candidial and trichomonal infection in inflammatory pap smears. the overall prevalence of candidial and trichomonal infections was 3.40% and 1.88%, respectively. there were striking differences in the prevalence of trichomoniasis ranging from 1.74% in the district health centre population to 3.77% in the venereal disease clinic patients; however, the prevalence of candidial infection remained the same (3.40%) in these two distinct population groups. indices of socioeconomic status--education and personal hygiene--showed an inverse association with the prevalence of trichomoniasis but a positive correlation with candidiasis. among participants, younger age (< 20 years old) was independently associated with candidial (or = 1.95) and trichomonal (or = 3.87) infections. no sexual behavioural factors were associated with candidial infection in this study; however, having multiple sexual partners (or = 5.07) was associated with a significantly elevated risk of trichomoniasis, while using condoms was associated with a diminished risk (or = 0.38). the presence of candidiasis and trichomoniasis was highly associated with abnormal cytologic findings, particularly those indicative of inflammation. there was little evidence that findings suggestive of cervical cancer could be attributed to either candidial or trichomonal infections. these data suggest that trichomoniasis is consistent with venereal transmission of the disease, but transmission by contaminated objects cannot be ruled out because there is an increased relation between trichomoniasis infection and socioeconomic conditions and personal hygiene. elucidation of such  differences may be helpful in designing different strategies to control these infections. furthermore, the findings can provide a good baseline of prevalence for investigating the relationship between these two pathogens and cervical dysplasia.

TI  == evaluation of api coryne system for identifying coryneform bacteria.
AB  == aim: to identify rapidly and accurately coryneform bacteria, using a commercial strip system. methods: ninety eight strains of corynebacterium species and 62 additional strains belonging to genera erysipelothrix, oerskovia, rhodococcus, actinomyces, archanobacterium, gardnerella and listeria were studied. bacteria were identified using conventional biochemical tests and a commercial system (api-coryne, biomerieux, france). fresh rabbit serum was added to fermentation tubes for gardnerella vaginalis isolates. results: one hundred and five out of the 160 (65.7%) organisms studied were correctly and completely identified by the api coryne system. thirty five (21.8%) more were correctly identified with additional tests. seventeen (10.6%) organisms were not identified by the system and three (1.9%) were misidentified. conclusions: the system was a good alternative for identification of coryneform organisms. when occasionally performed with some additional tests, this method permits reliable and rapid identification of coryneform organisms compared with conventional methods.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == salpingitis; aspects of diagnosis and etiology: a 4-year study from a swedish capital hospital.
AB  == 359 patients underwent laparoscopy to verify the diagnosis of salpingitis. pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) was found in 187 (52%) cases. laparoscopy revealed normal conditions in 136 (37%) cases. other diseases were diagnosed in 36 (10%) cases. bacteriological cultures from the fimbrial lumen were positive in 24% of the pid cases. chlamydia trachomatis (ct) was detected in 12%, bacteroides species (bs) in 5%, actinomyces israelii (ai) in 3%, gardnerella vaginalis (gv) in 2%, neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) in 1%, and ureaplasma urealyticum (uu) in 1%. cervical cultures were positive for ng and/or ct in 71% of the pid cases but only in 19% of the non-pid cases. from these no positive intra-abdominal cultures were detected. serological tests for ct were carried out. a positive acute titre of greater than or equal to 1/64 was noted in 37%, a seroconversion (x4) 2-3 weeks later was found in 14%. positive serology despite a negative culture was registered in 19%.

TI  == [isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  == thirty-four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied. they were isolated from non specific vaginitis. a presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. the differentiation of gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in glc. all gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. they are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  == the detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. it is also useful in identifying eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera bacteroides, clostridium, actinomyces, and bacillus. currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. a 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. the reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees c. when dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees c for 4 weeks.

TI  == a taxonomic study of gardnerella vaginalis (haemophilus vaginalis) gardner and dukes 1955.
AB  == fifty-five strains received as haemophilus vaginalis or as catalase-negative coryneform bacteria from the vagina together with 61 marker cultures were subjected to numerical phenetic analyses using 149 unit characters. the data were examined using the simple matching (ssm), jaccard (sj) and pattern (dp) coefficients and clustering was achieved using the average linkage algorithm. cluster composition was not markedly affected by the coefficient used or by test  error, estimated at 6 . 5%. the h. vaginalis strains formed a tight cluster which was only distantly related to representatives of the genera arthrobacter, cellulomonas, corynebacterium sensu stricto, erysipelothrix, haemophilus, kurthia, lactobacillus, listeria and propionibacterium but shared a high overall  affinity to unclassified catalase-negative coryneforms which formed a discrete taxon, cluster 9. the h. vaginalis strains could be distinguished from the related strains in cluster 9 by several unrelated phenotypic characters. using the s1 endonuclease assay, dna-dna hybridizations were performed with representative strains from the numerical as well as with reference strains of bifidobacterium and actinomyces. haemophilus vaginalis was found to be a genotypically legitimate group and its dna showed little homology with dna from the marker strains tested. the dna base composition of h. vaginalis was 42 to 44  mol % guanine plus cytosine. a new genus should be created to incorporate strains known as h. vaginalis or corynebacterium vaginale. the name gardnerella vaginalis proposed by greenwood & pickett (1979) is supported.
