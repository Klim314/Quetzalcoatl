TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == allisonella histaminiformans gen. nov., sp. nov. a novel bacterium that produces  histamine, utilizes histidine as its sole energy source, and could play a role in bovine and equine laminitis.
AB  == when cattle and horses are fed large amounts of grain, histamine can accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, and this accumulation can cause an acute inflammation of the hooves (laminitis). when ruminal fluid from dairy cattle fed  grain supplements was serially diluted in anaerobic mrs medium containing histidine (50 mm), histamine was detected at dilutions as high as 10(-7). the histidine enrichments were then transferred successively in an anaerobic, carbonate-based medium (50 mm histidine) without glucose. the histamine producing bacteria could not be isolated from the rumens of cattle fed hay; however, histamine producing bacteria could be isolated the feces of cattle fed grain and  the cecum of a horse. all of the histamine producing isolates had the same ovoid  morphology. the cells stained gram-negative and were resistant to the ionophore,  monensin (25 microm). the doubling time was 110 min, and the yield was 1.5 mg cell protein per mmol histidine. the g+c content was 46.8%. lysine was the only other amino acid used, but lysine did not allow growth if histidine was absent. because carbohydrate and organic acid utilization was not detected, it appeared that the isolates used histidine decarboxylation as their sole mechanism of energy derivation. 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that the isolates were most closely related to low g+c gram-positive bacteria (firmicutes), but similarities  were < or = 94%. because the most closely related bacteria (dialister pneumonsintes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium) did not produce  histamine from histidine, we propose that these histamine producing bacteria be assigned to a new genus, allisonella, as allisonella histaminiformans gen. nov.,  sp. nov. the type strain is mr2 (atcc baa610, dsm 15230).

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.

TI  == transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora.
AB  == the microflora in strained rumen fluid did not methylate or volatilize 203hg2+ at detectable rates. however, there was an exponential decay in the concentration of added ch3hg+, which was attributed to demethylation. the major product of demethylation was metallic mercury (hg0), and it was released as a volatile product from the reaction mixture. demethylation occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the rate of demethylation was proportional to the concentration of added ch3hg+-hg from 0.02 to 100 microgram of hg per ml. the presence of hgcl2 had almost no inhibitory effect on the rate of cleavage of the  carbon-mercury bond of ch2hgcl, but it completely inhibited volatilization of the hg formed, when the concentration of hgcl2-hg reached 100 micrograms/ml. three of 11 species of anaerobic rumen bacteria catalyzed demethylation. these were desulfovibrio desulfuricans, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphaera elsdenii. none of the 11 species caused detectable methylation, and only two caused limited volatilization of hg2+. three species of bacteria out of 90 fresh aerobic isolates from rumen contents were demethylators: two were identified as pseudomonas sp., and the third was a micrococcus sp. demethylation by the rumen microflora appeared to be carried out by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, on the basis of hg2+ sensitivity, probably resulted from the activity of two enzymes, a ch3-hg+ hydrolase and a hg2+ reductase.
