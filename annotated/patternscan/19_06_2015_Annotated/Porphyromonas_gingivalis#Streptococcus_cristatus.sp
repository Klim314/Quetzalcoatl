TI  == a yada-like autotransporter, hag1 in veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  == dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. the veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the  oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. however, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. in this study, we used our recently discovered transformable veillonella strain, veillonella atypica ok5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between veillonella species and other oral bacteria. by insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in v. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. the entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus arca interferes with porphyromonas gingivalis pathogenicity in mice.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as one of  the major pathogens in chronic periodontitis, an infectious disease affecting the majority of the adult population. we have previously demonstrated that a surface  protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of streptococcus cristatus represses production of p. gingivalis long fimbriae and interrupts the formation of p. gingivalis biofilms in vitro. our in vivo studies have also shown that the distribution of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in human subgingival plaque is negatively correlated. the objective of this study was to determine if s. cristatus arca inhibits p. gingivalis colonization and attenuates its subsequent  pathogenesis in alveolar bone loss in the murine oral cavity. material and methods: a wild-type strain of s. cristatus (cc5a) and its arca knockout mutant (arcae) were used as initial colonizers in the oral cavity of balb/cbyj mice. colonization of p. gingivalis on the existing s. cristatus biofilms was assessed  by quantitative pcr, and p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was measured 6  wk after p. gingivalis infection. results: the presence of s. cristatus cc5a, but not its arca mutant, attenuated p. gingivalis colonization in the murine oral cavity. in addition, p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was significantly lower in mice initially infected with s. cristatus cc5a than in those infected with the arca mutant. conclusion: this study provides direct evidence that s. cristatus arca has an inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis colonization, which may  in turn attenuate the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis.

TI  == role of arginine deiminase of streptococcus cristatus in porphyromonas gingivalis colonization.
AB  == the ability to attach to a variety of oral surfaces is an important characteristic of porphyromonas gingivalis. previous studies have demonstrated that expression and production of fima, a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae, is required for p. gingivalis colonization. here we report that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca) of streptococcus cristatus, represses  fima production and inhibits biofilm formation of p. gingivalis. this inhibitory  function of arca is also observed in the formation of heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilms. p. gingivalis is released from streptococcal substrates in the presence of arca, likely due to an inhibition of  fima production. this work suggests that arca may have the potential to be a specific antibiofilm agent to fight p. gingivalis infections.

TI  == negative correlation of distributions of streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major causative agents of adult periodontitis. one of the features of this periodontal pathogen is its ability to attach to a variety of oral bacterial surfaces and to colonize subgingival dental plaque. we have shown that streptococcus cristatus cc5a inhibits expression of fima, a gene encoding the major protein subunit of long fimbriae in p. gingivalis; as a result, s. cristatus interrupts formation of p. gingivalis biofilms. here we further demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of s. cristatus affects multiple strains of p. gingivalis and that optimal inhibitory activity correlates with levels of arginine deiminase expression in s. cristatus. more strikingly, the impact of s. cristatus on p. gingivalis colonization was revealed by comparing levels of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in subgingival dental plaque. spearman correlation analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distributions of s. cristatus and p. gingivalis (r = -0.57; p < 0.05). these data suggest that some early colonizers of dental plaque, such as s. cristatus, may be beneficial to the host by antagonizing the colonization and accumulation of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == role of differential expression of streptococcal arginine deiminase in inhibition of fima expression in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == streptococcus cristatus arca inhibits production of a major adhesin, fima, in porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary periodontal pathogen. in this study, we demonstrate the differential expression of arca in two streptococcal species. the expression level of arca in streptococci appears to be controlled by both cis and trans elements.

TI  == identification of a signalling molecule involved in bacterial intergeneric communication.
AB  == the development of complex multispecies communities such as biofilms is controlled by interbacterial communication systems. we have previously reported an intergeneric communication between two oral bacteria, streptococcus cristatus  and porphyromonas gingivalis, that results in inhibition of fima expression. here, we demonstrate that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of s. cristatus serves as a signal that initiates intergeneric communication. an arca-deficient mutant of s. cristatus is unable to communicate with p. gingivalis. furthermore, arginase activity is not essential for the communication, and arca retains the ability to repress expression of fima in the  presence of arginine deiminase inhibitors. these results present a novel mechanism by which intergeneric communication in dental biofilms is accomplished.

TI  == association of a high-molecular weight arginine-binding protein of fusobacterium  nucleatum atcc 10953 with adhesion to secretory immunoglobulin a and coaggregation with streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == introduction: fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with a diverse range of bacterial species, and binds to host tissues and proteins such as immunoglobulin. these interactions may support the attachment of a variety of organisms to oral surfaces and can facilitate the invasion of soft tissues. we hypothesized that coaggregation with streptococci and immunoglobulin binding may occur by a common  adhesin sensitive to l-arginine. methods: repeated mixing of f. nucleatum with non-immune secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) and recovery of non-agglutinating cells isolated a spontaneous mutant (isolate 21) of f. nucleatum that was defective in s-iga binding. wild-type and mutant f. nucleatum were compared by coaggregation and adhesion assays. results: isolate 21 exhibited significantly reduced s-iga binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci but not with porphyromonas gingivalis. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant was deficient compared to wild-type for  a single protein of approximately 360 kilodaltons. the corresponding protein was  isolated from wild-type f. nucleatum protein preparations by coprecipitation with arginine-agarose beads. this protein was able to bind both streptococcus cristatus and s-iga. mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this protein was closely related to putative autotransporter proteins in other f. nucleatum strains and was a 100% match to the deduced amino acid sequence of a 10,638-base-pair open reading frame in the incomplete genome sequence of f. nucleatum atcc 10,953. peptides identified by ms-ms analysis spanned most of the  predicted amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein is not subject  to postsecretory cleavage. conclusion: coaggregation represents a novel function  within the autotransporter class of proteins, which are often associated with virulence.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in fima regulation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an important component of the complex plaque biofilm  that is a direct precursor of periodontal disease. the major fimbriae are required for attachment to oral surfaces and are an important virulence factor. fimbrillin (fima) expression in p. gingivalis is inhibited by surface molecule of streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque. in this study, differential display pcr was used to identify p. gingivalis genes that are regulated in response to s. cristatus. of several differentially expressed genes, pg2131 and pg2167 were upregulated by s. cristatus signaling molecules. a null mutant of pg2167 did not transcriptionally regulate fima following exposure to s. cristatus. in fact, fima transcription was enhanced in the pg2167 mutant, suggesting that pg2167 may act to repress fima expression. in contrast, a mutation in pg2131 did not affect transcription of fima in the presence of s. cristatus. however, production of fimbrillin was significantly diminished in the  pg2131 mutant, implicating involvement in posttranscriptional regulation in fimbriation. these data suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriation is controlled by more than one regulation mechanism, involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.

TI  == intergeneric communication in dental plaque biofilms.
AB  == dental plaque is a complex biofilm that accretes in a series of discrete steps proceeding from a gram-positive streptococcus-rich biofilm to a structure rich in gram-negative anaerobes. this study investigated information flow between two unrelated plaque bacteria, streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis.  a surface protein of s. cristatus caused repression of the p. gingivalis fimbrial gene (fima), as determined by a chromosomal fima promoter-lacz reporter construct and by reverse transcription-pcr. signaling activity was associated with a 59-kda surface protein of s. cristatus and showed specificity for the fima gene. furthermore, p. gingivalis was unable to form biofilm microcolonies with s. cristatus. thus, s. cristatus is capable of modulating virulence gene expression  in p. gingivalis, consequently influencing the development of pathogenic plaque.
