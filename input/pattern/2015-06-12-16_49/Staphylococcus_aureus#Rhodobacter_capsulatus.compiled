TI  - Functional properties of diapophytoene and related desaturases of C(30) and C(40) carotenoid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  - The desaturation reactions of C(30) carotenoids from diapophytoene to diaponeurosporene was investigated in vitro and by complementation in Escherichia coli. The expressed diapophytoene desaturase from Staphylococcus aureus inserts three double bonds in an FAD-dependent reaction. The enzyme is inhibited by diphenylamine. In the complementation experiment diapophytoene desaturase was able to convert C(40) phytoene to some extend but exhibited a high affinity to zeta-carotene. Comparison to the reaction of a phytoene desaturase from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzing a parallel three-step desaturation sequence with the corresponding C(40) carotenes revealed that this desaturase can also convert C(30) diapophytoene. Other homologous bacterial C(40) carotene desaturases could also utilize C(30) substrates, including one type of zeta-carotene desaturase which converted diaponeurosporene to diapolycopene. Further complementation experiments including the diapophytoene synthase gene from S. aureus revealed that the C(30) carotenogenic pathway is determined by this initial enzyme which is highly homologous to C(40) phytoene synthases.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the gene for a novel protein with a possible regulatory function encoded in the beta operon of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Although considerable homology exists between the translation products of the rplL, rpoB and rpoC genes of the beta operons of the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus the region between the rplL and rpoB genes is quite different in the two bacterial species. In E. coli the 324 bp has three centres of dyad symmetry in the first half of the sequence and multiple nonsense codons in all three reading frames. By contrast, the corresponding region in S. aureus consists of 1000 bp capable of forming a similar arrangement of stem-loop structures but with an open reading frame, sited 177 bp downstream of the end of rplL and 217 bp upstream of the beginning of the rpoB gene, with consensus initiation and termination signals, which if translated would generate a 22,665 Da protein with 202 amino acids. In view of the inability to find any significant homology with other proteins in the data bank and because the evidence suggests, as in E. coli, that the rplL-rpoB intergenic sequence is involved in regulation it is proposed that the expression product of orf202 may be a further element of control in the S. aureus beta operon.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Rhodobacter capsulatus fruK gene, which encodes fructose-1-phosphate kinase: evidence for a kinase superfamily including both phosphofructokinases of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The fruK gene encoding fructose-1-phosphate kinase (FruK), located within the fructose (fru)-catabolic operon of Rhodobacter capsulatus, was sequenced. FruK of R. capsulatus (316 amino acids; molecular weight = 31,232) is the same size as and is homologous to FruK of Escherichia coli, phosphofructokinase B (PfkB) of E. coli, phosphotagatokinase of Staphylococcus aureus, and ribokinase of E. coli. These proteins therefore make up a family of homologous proteins, termed the PfkB family. A phylogenetic tree for this new family was constructed. Sequence comparisons plus chemical inactivation studies suggested the lack of involvement of specific residues in catalysis. Although the Rhodobacter FruK differed markedly from the other enzymes within the PfkB family with respect to amino acid composition, these enzymes exhibited similar predicted secondary structural features. A large internal segment of the Rhodobacter FruK was found to be similar in sequence to the domain bearing the sugar bisphosphate-binding region of the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of plants and bacteria. Proteins of the PfkB family did not exhibit statistically significant sequence identity with PfkA of E. coli. PfkA, however, is homologous to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic ATP- and PPi-dependent Pfks (the PfkA family). These eukaryotic, ATP-dependent enzymes each consist of a homotetramer (mammalian) or a heterooctamer (yeasts), with each subunit containing an internal duplication of the size of the entire PfkA protein of E. coli. In some of these enzymes, additional domains are present. A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the PfkA family and revealed that the bacterial enzymes closely resemble the N-terminal domains of the eukaryotic enzyme subunits whereas the C-terminal domains have diverged more extensively. The PPi-dependent Pfk of potato is only distantly related to the ATP-dependent enzymes. On the basis of their similar functions, sizes, predicted secondary structures, and sequences, we suggest that the PfkA and PfkB families share a common evolutionary origin.
