TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the effects of bacteroides sp., fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides fragilis, and sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo  and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of escherichia coli and salmonella minnesota, wild type and r595. intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid a of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of  coagulation. lipopolysaccharide and lipid a of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause  aggregation of human platelets in vitro. washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid a of bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and c6-deficient rabbit plasma. lipid a, but not lipopolysaccharide, of e. coli and washed cells of s. minnesota r595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. these results indicated that bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets  or terminal components of complement.
