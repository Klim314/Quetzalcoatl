TI  == effects of plant antimicrobial phenolic compounds on virulence of the genus pectobacterium.
AB  == pectobacterium spp. are among the most devastating necrotrophs, attacking more than 50% of angiosperm plant orders. their virulence strategy is based mainly on  the secretion of exoenzymes that degrade the cell walls of their hosts, providing nutrients to the bacteria, but conversely, exposing the bacteria to plant defense compounds. in the present study, we screened plant-derived antimicrobial compounds, mainly phenolic acids and polyphenols, for their ability to affect virulence determinants including motility, biofilm formation and extracellular enzyme activities of different pectobacteria: pectobacterium carotovorum, p. brasiliensis, p. atrosepticum and p. aroidearum. in addition, virulence assays were performed on three different plant hosts following exposure of the bacteria  to selected phenolic compounds. these experiments showed that cinnamic, coumaric, syringic and salicylic acids and catechol can considerably reduce disease severity, ranging from 20 to 100%. the reduced disease severity was not only the  result of reduced bacterial growth, but also of a direct effect of the compounds  on important bacterial virulence determinants, including pectolytic and proteolytic exoenzyme activities, that were reduced by 50-100%. this is the first report revealing a direct effect of phenolic compounds on virulence factors in a  wide range of pectobacterium strains.

TI  == isolation and genomic characterization of the t4-like bacteriophage pm2 infecting pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum.
AB  == in order to control pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, a novel virulent bacteriophage pm2 was isolated. bacteriophage pm2 can infect 48% of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and 78% of p. carotovorum subsp. brasilliensis but none of atrosepticum, betavasculorum, odoriferum and wasabiae isolates had been infected with pm2. pm2 phage belongs to the family myoviridae, and contains a large head and contractile tail. it has a 170,286 base pair genome that encodes 291 open reading frames (orfs) and 12 trnas. most orfs in bacteriophage pm2 share a high level of homology with t4-like phages including ime08, rb69, and js98. phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of terminase large subunits confirmed that pm2 is classified as a t4-like phage. it contains no integrase- or no repressor-coding genes related to the lysogenic cycle, and lifestyle prediction using phact software suggested that pm2 is a virulent bacteriophage.

TI  == deciphering the dual effect of lipopolysaccharides from plant pathogenic pectobacterium.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are a component of the outer cell surface of almost all gram-negative bacteria and play an essential role for bacterial growth and survival. lipopolysaccharides represent typical microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp) molecules and have been reported to induce defense-related responses, including the expression of defense genes and the suppression of the hypersensitive response in plants. however, depending on their origin and the challenged plant, lps were shown to have complex and different roles. in this study we showed that lps from plant pathogens pectobacterium atrosepticum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum induce common and different responses in a. thaliana cells when compared to those induced by lps from non-phytopathogens escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among common responses to both types of lps are the transcription of defense genes and their ability to limit of cell death induced by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. however, the differential kinetics and amplitude in reactive oxygen  species (ros) generation seemed to regulate defense gene transcription and be determinant to induce programmed cell death in response to lps from the plant pathogenic pectobacterium. these data suggest that different signaling pathways could be activated by lps in a. thaliana cells.

TI  == simultaneous detection of major blackleg and soft rot bacterial pathogens in potato by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for simultaneous, fast and reliable detection of the main soft rot and blackleg potato pathogens in europe has been developed. it utilises three pairs of primers and enables detection of three groups of pectinolytic bacteria frequently found in potato, namely: pectobacterium atrosepticum, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum together with pectobacterium wasabiae and dickeya spp. in a multiplex pcr assay.  in studies with axenic cultures of bacteria, the multiplex assay was specific as  it gave positive results only with strains of the target species and negative results with 18 non-target species of bacteria that can possibly coexist with pectinolytic bacteria in a potato ecosystem. the developed assay could detect as  little as 0.01 ng microl-1 of dickeya sp. genomic dna, and down to 0.1 ng microl-1 of p. atrosepticum and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum genomic dna in  vitro. in the presence of competitor genomic dna, isolated from pseudomonas fluorescens cells, the sensitivity of the multiplex pcr decreased tenfold for p.  atrosepticum and dickeya sp., while no change was observed for p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and p. wasabiae. in spiked potato haulm and tuber samples, the threshold level for target bacteria was 101 cfu ml-1 plant extract (102 cfu g-1 plant tissue), 102 cfu ml-1 plant extract (103 cfu g-1 plant tissue), 103 cfu ml-1 plant extract (104 cfu g-1 plant tissue), for dickeya spp., p. atrosepticum  and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum/p. wasabiae, respectively. most of all, this assay allowed reliable detection and identification of soft rot and blackleg pathogens in naturally infected symptomatic and asymptomatic potato stem and progeny tuber samples collected from potato fields all over poland.

TI  == genomic overview of the phytopathogen pectobacterium wasabiae strain rns 08.42.1a suggests horizontal acquisition of quorum-sensing genes.
AB  == the blackleg and soft-rot diseases caused by pectinolytic enterobacteria such as  pectobacterium and dickeya are major causes of losses affecting potato crop in the field and upon storage. in this work, we report the isolation, characterization and genome analysis of the pectobacterium wasabiae (formerly identified as pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum) strain rns 08.42.1a, that has been isolated from a solanum tuberosum host plant in france. comparative genomics with 3 other p. wasabiae strains isolated from potato plants in different areas in north america and europe, highlighted both a strong similarity at the whole genome level (ani > 99 %) and a conserved synteny of the virulence genes. in addition, our analyses evidenced a robust separation between these four p. wasabiae strains and the type strain p. wasabiae cfbp 3304(t), isolated from horseradish in japan. in p. wasabiae rns 08.42.1a, the expi and expr nucleotidic  sequences are more related to those of some pectobacterium atrosepticum and p. carotovorum strains (90 % of identity) than to those of the other potato p. wasabiae strains (70 to 74 % of identity). this could suggest a recruitment of these genes in the p. wasabiae strain rns 08.42.1a by an horizontal transfer between pathogens infecting the same potato host plant.

TI  == an easy, simple inexpensive test for the specific detection of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum based on sequence analysis of the pmra gene.
AB  == background: the species pectobacterium carotovorum includes a diverse subspecies  of bacteria that cause disease on a wide variety of plants. in morocco, approximately 95% of the p. carotovorum isolates from potato plants with tuber soft rot are p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. however, identification of this pathogen is not always related to visual disease symptoms. this is especially true when different pathogen cause similar diseases on potato, citing as an example, p. carotovorum, p. atrosepticum and p. wasabiae. numerous conventional methods were used to characterize pectobacterium spp., including biochemical assays, specific pcr-based tests, and construction of phylogenetic trees by using gene sequences. in this study, an alternative method is presented using a gene linked to pathogenicity, in order to allow accuracy at subspecies level. the pmra gene (response regulator) has been used for identification and analysis of the relationships among twenty nine pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and other pectobacterium subspecies. results: phylogenetic analyses of pmra sequences compared to eric-pcr and 16s rdna sequencing, demonstrated that there is considerable genetic diversity in p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strains, which can be divided into two distinct groups within the same clade. conclusions: pmra sequence analysis is likely to be a reliable tool to identify the subspecies pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and estimate their genetic diversity.

TI  == control of potato soft rot caused by pectobacterium carotovorum and pectobacterium atrosepticum by moroccan actinobacteria isolates.
AB  == pectobacterium carotovorum and pectobacterium atrosepticum are dreadful causal agents of potato soft rot. actually, there are no efficient bactericides used to  protect potato against pectobacterium spp. biological control using actinobacteria could be an interesting approach to manage this disease. thus, two hundred actinobacteria isolated from moroccan habitats were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro 4 environmental pectobacterium strains and the two reference strains (p. carotovorum cfbp 5890 and p. atrosepticum cfbp 5889). eight percent of these isolates were active against at least one of the tested pathogens and only 2% exhibited an antimicrobial activity against all tested pectobacterium strains. four bioactive isolates having the greatest pathogen inhibitory capabilities and classified as belonging to the genus streptomyces species through 16s rdna analysis were subsequently tested for their ability to reduce in vivo soft rot symptoms on potato slices of bintje, yukon gold, russet and norland cultivars caused by the two pathogens p. carotovorum and p. atrosepticum. this test was carried out by using biomass inoculums and culture filtrate of the isolates as treatment. among these, strain streptomyces sp. oe7,  reduced by 65-94% symptom severity caused by the two pathogens on potato slices.  streptomyces oe7 showed a potential for controlling soft rot on potato slices and could be useful in an integrated control program against potato soft rot pathogens in the objective to reduce treatments with chemical compounds.

TI  == taxonomic relatedness between pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. odoriferum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense subsp. nov.
AB  == aims: pectobacterium carotovorum is a heterogeneous species consisting of two named subspecies, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and p. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum. a third subspecies, p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense, was previously proposed. the study aimed to confirm the subspecies status and validate the proposed name of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense using a novel and standard microbial taxonomy. methods and results: dna-dna hybridization confirmed that p.  carotovorum subsp. brasiliense is a different species from p. wasabiae, p. betavasculorum and p. atrosepticum, with 28, 35 and 55% similarity values, respectively, but is a member of the p. carotovorum species with 73-77% similarity values. sequencing the entire 16s rrna gene of two polymorphic copies  from strains of each of the p. carotovorum subspecies demonstrated that the average 16s rrna gene sequence diversity between p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum was lower than the maximum genetic distances between two sequence types obtained from the same strain. multilocus sequence analysis based on eight housekeeping genes (mtld, acna, icda, mdh, pgi, gaba, proa and rpos) differentiated the subspecies and delineated two p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense clades. conclusion: pectobacterium carotovorum  subsp. brasiliense clade i was comprised of strains isolated from brazil and peru, while clade ii included strains from asia, north america and europe. strains in clade i but not clade ii were phenotypically consistent with the original description of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense in that they produced reducing substances from sucrose and acid from alpha-methyl glucoside. the type strain for p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense 212(t) (= lmg2137(t) = ibsbf1692(t)  = cfbp6617(t) ) was previously designated. the gc mol content of the type strain  is 51.7%. significant and impact of the study: the study introduces a full description for the strains belonging to the two different clades assigned to p.  carotovorum subsp. brasiliense.

TI  == pectobacterium spp. associated with bacterial stem rot syndrome of potato in canada.
AB  == pectobacterium atrosepticum, p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, and p. wasabiae were detected in potato stems with blackleg symptoms using species- and subspecies-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  the tests included a new assay for p. wasabiae based on the phytase gene sequence. identification of isolates from diseased stems by biochemical or physiological characterization, pcr, and multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) largely confirmed the pcr detection of pectobacterium spp. in stem samples. p. atrosepticum was most commonly present but was the sole pectobacterium sp. detected in only 52% of the diseased stems. p. wasabiae was most frequently present in combination with p. atrosepticum and was the sole pectobacterium sp. detected in 13% of diseased stems. pathogenicity of p. wasabiae on potato and its capacity to cause blackleg disease were demonstrated by stem inoculation and its  isolation as the sole pectobacterium sp. from field-grown diseased plants produced from inoculated seed tubers. incidence of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis was low in diseased stems, and the ability of canadian strains to cause blackleg in plants grown from inoculated tubers was not confirmed. canadian isolates of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis differed from brazilian isolates in diagnostic biochemical tests but conformed to the subspecies in pcr specificity and typing by mlst.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == ferredoxin containing bacteriocins suggest a novel mechanism of iron uptake in pectobacterium spp.
AB  == in order to kill competing strains of the same or closely related bacterial species, many bacteria produce potent narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics known as bacteriocins. two sequenced strains of the phytopathogenic bacterium pectobacterium carotovorum carry genes encoding putative bacteriocins which have  seemingly evolved through a recombination event to encode proteins containing an  n-terminal domain with extensive similarity to a [2fe-2s] plant ferredoxin and a  c-terminal colicin m-like catalytic domain. in this work, we show that these genes encode active bacteriocins, pectocin m1 and m2, which target strains of pectobacterium carotovorum and pectobacterium atrosepticum with increased potency under iron limiting conditions. the activity of pectocin m1 and m2 can be inhibited by the addition of spinach ferredoxin, indicating that the ferredoxin domain of these proteins acts as a receptor binding domain. this effect is not observed with the mammalian ferredoxin protein adrenodoxin, indicating that pectobacterium spp. carries a specific receptor for plant ferredoxins and that these plant pathogens may acquire iron from the host through the uptake of ferredoxin. in further support of this hypothesis we show that the growth of strains of pectobacterium carotovorum and atrosepticum that are not sensitive to  the cytotoxic effects of pectocin m1 is enhanced in the presence of pectocin m1 and m2 under iron limiting conditions. a similar growth enhancement under iron limiting conditions is observed with spinach ferrodoxin, but not with adrenodoxin. our data indicate that pectocin m1 and m2 have evolved to parasitise an existing iron uptake pathway by using a ferredoxin-containing receptor binding domain as a trojan horse to gain entry into susceptible cells.

TI  == molecular characterization of spoilage bacteria as a means to observe the microbiological quality of carrot.
AB  == this study characterized the bacteria causing decay of carrots during storage and marketing. spoilage strains were identified by 16s-amplified rdna restriction analysis and intergenic transcribed spacer-pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (its-pcr-rflp). genotypic fingerprinting by rflp-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to assess the genetic diversity of the isolates. a total of 252 pseudomonas isolates from carrots were identified and classified into eight separate groups. most strains belonged to group a (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas marginalis, and pseudomonas veronii) and group b (pseudomonas putida). the strains identified as pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pectobacterium atrosepticum, dickeya chrysanthemi, and erwinia rhapontici were distinguished by its-pcr-rflp. all isolates belonging to the genera pectobacterium and erwinia were responsible for carrot spoilage. this work has led to the development of new strategies for the identification and genotyping of vegetable-spoiling strains of pseudomonas, pectobacterium, and erwinia. this is also the first report describing the occurrence of carrot-spoiling e. rhapontici. early recognition of spoilage bacteria in vegetables is important for the implementation of effective handling strategies. pectolytic bacteria may cause considerable financial losses because they account for a large proportion of bacterial rot of fruits and vegetables during storage, transit, and marketing.

TI  == calcium- and ros-mediated defence responses in by2 tobacco cells by nonpathogenic streptomyces sp.
AB  == aims: the early molecular events underlying the elicitation of plant defence reactions by gram-positive bacteria are relatively unknown. in plants, calcium and reactive oxygen species are commonly involved as cellular messengers of a wide range of biotic stimuli from pathogenic to symbiotic bacteria. in the present work, we checked whether nonpathogenic streptomyces sp. strains could induce early signalling events leading to defence responses in by2 tobacco cell suspensions. methods and results: we have demonstrated that nonpathogenic streptomyces sp. oe7 strain induced a cytosolic ca(2+) increase and a biphasic oxidative burst in the upstream signalling events, leading to defence responses in by2 tobacco cell suspensions. streptomyces sp. oe7 also elicited delayed intracellular free scopoletin production and programmed cell death. in agreement  with scopoletin production, oe7 induced accumulation of pal transcripts and increased accumulation of transcripts of erebp1 and aox genes that are known to be regulated by the jasmonate/ethylene pathway. transcript levels of pr1b and nimin2alpha, both salicylic acid pathway-linked genes, were not modified. moreover, streptomyces sp. oe7 culture filtrates could reduce pectobacterium carotovorum- and pectobacterium atrosepticum-induced death of by2 cells and soft  rot on potato slices. conclusions: new insights are thus provided into the interaction mechanisms between streptomyces sp. and plants; streptomyces sp. could be sensed by plant cells, and through cytosolic ca(2+) changes and the generation of reactive oxygen species, defence responses were induced. significance and impact of the study: these induced defence responses appeared to participate in attenuating pectobacterium-induced diseases in plants. thus, streptomyces sp. oe7 could be a biocontrol agent against pectobacterium sp.

TI  == occurrence of pectobacterium carotovorum strains isolated from potato soft rot in morocco.
AB  == pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pectobacterium astrosepticum and pectobacterium chrysanthemi are the soft rot tuber of potatoes pathogens (solanum tuberosum). the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of these pathogens in moroccan regions producing potatoes. fifty three isolates of pectobacterium were isolated on medium crystal violet pectate. the comparison of  their bacteriological characteristics with standard strains allowed us to conclude that all the isolates belonged to the pectobacterium. with regard to phenotype characteristics, the variability that was found included 32 typical pectobacetrium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, 3 typical pectobacterium atrosepticum, and 18 atypical pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. three strains of the atypical group; showed that the biochemical properties overlap among the pectobacterium carotovorum and pectobacterium chrysanthemi. these data were needed molecular characterization. however, the pcr amplification of total genomic dna of 53 isolates with the two primers y1/y2 and p143/p145 yielded an amplified fragment of the expected size (434 bp) only with y1/y2, indicated that all the isolates collected and tested belonged to the pectobacterium carotovorum species. on the basis the pathogenicity tests, these strains revealed that they were pectinolytic, and showed differences in aggressiveness against potato and leaves of tobacco.

TI  == aepa of pectobacterium is not involved in the regulation of extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes production.
AB  == plant cell wall degrading enzymes (pcwde) are the major virulence determinants in phytopathogenic pectobacterium, and their production is controlled by many regulatory factors. in this study, we focus on the role of the aepa protein, which was previously described to be a global regulator of pcwde production in pectobacterium carotovorum (murata et al. in mol plant microbe interact 4:239-246, 1991). our results show that neither inactivation nor overexpression of aepa affects pcwde production in either pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 or pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum scc3193. the previously published observation based on the overexpression of aepa could be explained by the presence of the adjacent regulatory rsmb gene in the constructs used. our database searches indicated that aepa belongs to the ytcj subfamily of amidohydrolases. ytcj-like amidohydrolases are present in bacteria, archaea, plants and some fungi. although aepa has 28% identity with the formamide deformylase nfda in arthrobacter pascens f164, aepa was unable to catalyze the degradation of ndfa-specific n-substituted formamides. we conclude that aepa is a putative aminohydrolase not involved in regulation of pcwde production.

TI  == specific maceration and induction of pr-3 gene in potato tuber tissue by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum type iii secretion system mutants.
AB  == the exact function of type iii secretion system in some phytopathogenes including pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum (pca) is not understood and is a matter of debate. the aim of this study were to determine specific effect of type iii secretion system on potato tubers and to reveal the connection of this system with potato resistant genes such as pr-3. a pca hrpw fragment was subcloned into  a low-copy-number cloning vector (pzh448). the resulting plasmid (pas19) was then conjugated into the wild-type and mutant strains of pca by type iii secretion system. the virulence property of different pca strains was studied and the influence of over expression of hrpw on maceration activity was also investigated. furthermore, the effect of mentioned mutation on the maceration of  carrot-root was evaluated. finally, using real-time pcr, the copy-number of pr-3  gene in potato tuber tissue was assessed. in conclusion, for type iii secretion system mutant strains, in contrast with the wild-type, the maceration amount of potato tuber tissue decreased after over expression of hrpw while inoculation of  tubers by mutants, increased this amount. in the case of potato, hrpn and dspe proteins appeared to be avirulent factors. compared with the wild-type strains, pca nominated mutants significantly reduced potato pr-3 expression thus, pr-3 expression level in potato tuber tissue in answer to infiltration by pca, depends on functional type iii secretion system in the bacterium.

TI  == quorum sensing-controlled evr regulates a conserved cryptic pigment biosynthetic  cluster and a novel phenomycin-like locus in the plant pathogen, pectobacterium carotovorum.
AB  == pectobacterium carotovorum scri193 is a phytopathogenic gram-negative bacterium.  in this study, we have identified a novel cryptic pigment biosynthetic locus in p. carotovorum scri193 which we have called the pectobacterium orange pigment (pop) cluster. the pop cluster is flanked by two trna genes and contains genes that encode non-ribosomal peptide synthases and polyketide synthase and produces  a negatively charged polar orange pigment. orange pigment production is activated when an adjacent transcriptional activator sharing sequence similarity with the erwinia virulence regulator (evr) is overexpressed. evr was shown to positively activate its own transcription and that of the pigment biosynthetic genes and an  unlinked locus encoding a phenomycin homologue. in addition, the expression of evr and orange pigment production was shown to be regulated by n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-hsl (ohhl) quorum sensing and have a virulence phenotype in potato. finally, by comparative genomics and southern blotting we demonstrate that this pigment biosynthetic cluster is present in multiple p. carotovorum spp., pectobacterium brasiliensis 1692 and a truncated version of the cluster is  present in pectobacterium atrosepticum. the conserved nature of this cluster in p. carotovorum and p. brasiliensis suggests that the pop cluster has an important function in these broad-host-range soft rotting bacteria, which is no longer required in the narrow-host-range p. atrosepticum scri1043.

TI  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation analysis incorporating genomic organisation, and application to enterobacterial plant pathogens.
AB  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (acgh) provides an estimate of the relative abundance of genomic dna (gdna) taken from comparator and reference organisms by hybridisation to a microarray containing probes that represent sequences from the reference organism. the experimental method is used in a number of biological applications, including the detection of human chromosomal aberrations, and in comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains, but optimisation of the analysis is desirable in each problem domain.we present a method for analysis of bacterial acgh data that encodes spatial information from  the reference genome in a hidden markov model. this technique is the first such method to be validated in comparisons of sequenced bacteria that diverge at the strain and at the genus level: pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 (pba1043) and dickeya dadantii 3937 (dda3937); and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and  l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in all cases our method is found to outperform  common and widely used acgh analysis methods that do not incorporate spatial information. this analysis is applied to comparisons between commercially important plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria (sre) pba1043, p. atrosepticum scri1039, p. carotovorum 193, and dda3937.our analysis indicates that it should not be assumed that hybridisation strength is a reliable proxy for sequence identity in acgh experiments, and robustly extends the applicability of  acgh to bacterial comparisons at the genus level. our results in the sre further  provide evidence for a dynamic, plastic 'accessory' genome, revealing major genomic islands encoding gene products that provide insight into, and may play a  direct role in determining, variation amongst the sre in terms of their environmental survival, host range and aetiology, such as phytotoxin synthesis, multidrug resistance, and nitrogen fixation.

TI  == distinguishing bacterial pathogens of potato using a genome-wide microarray approach.
AB  == a set of 9676 probes was designed for the most harmful bacterial pathogens of potato and tested in a microarray format. gene-specific probes could be designed  for all genes of pectobacterium atrosepticum, c. 50% of the genes of streptomyces scabies and c. 30% of the genes of clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus utilizing the whole-genome sequence information available. for streptomyces turgidiscabies, 226 probes were designed according to the sequences of a pathogenicity island containing important virulence genes. in addition, probes were designed for the virulence-associated nip (necrosis-inducing protein) genes  of p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya dadantii and for the intergenic spacer (igs) sequences of the 16s-23s rrna gene region. ralstonia solanacearum was not included in the study, because it is a quarantine organism and is not presently found in finland, but a few probes were also designed for this species. the probes contained on average 40 target-specific nucleotides and were synthesized on the array in situ, organized as eight sub-arrays with an identical set of probes which could be used for hybridization with different samples. all bacteria were readily distinguished using a single channel system for signal detection. nearly all of the c. 1000 probes designed for c. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, c. 50% and 40% of the c. 4000 probes designed for the genes of s. scabies and p. atrosepticum, respectively, and over 100 probes for s. turgidiscabies showed significant signals only with the respective species. p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya strains were all detected with 110 common probes. by contrast, the strains of these species were found to differ in  their signal profiles. probes targeting the igs region and nip genes could be used to place strains of dickeya to two groups, which correlated with differences in virulence. taken together, the approach of using a custom-designed, genome-wide microarray provided a robust means for distinguishing the bacterial pathogens of potato.

AB  == we compare genome sequences of three closely related soft-rot pathogens that vary in host range and geographical distribution to identify genetic differences that  could account for lifestyle differences. the isolates compared, pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, p. carotovorum wpp14, and p. brasiliensis 1692, represent  diverse lineages of the genus. p. carotovorum and p. brasiliensis genome contigs, generated by 454 pyrosequencing ordered by reference to the previously published  complete circular chromosome of p. atrosepticum genome and each other, account for 96% of the predicted genome size. orthologous proteins encoded by p. carotovorum and p. brasiliensis are approximately 95% identical to each other and 92% identical to p. atrosepticum. multiple alignment using mauve identified a core genome of 3.9 mb conserved among these pectobacterium spp. each core genome  is interrupted at many points by species-specific insertions or deletions (indels) that account for approximately 0.9 to 1.1 mb. we demonstrate that the presence of a hrpk-like type iii secretion system-dependent effector protein in p. carotovorum and p. brasiliensis and its absence from p. atrosepticum is insufficient to explain variability in their response to infection in a plant. additional genes that vary among these species include those encoding peptide toxin production, enzyme production, secretion proteins, and antibiotic production, as well as differences in more general aspects of gene regulation and metabolism that may be relevant to pathogenicity.

TI  == microarray profiling of host-extract-induced genes and characterization of the type vi secretion cluster in the potato pathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum.
AB  == pectobacterium atrosepticum is a gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium that rots potato stems and tubers. microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed when host extracts were added to the growth medium. potato extracts downregulated the expression of ribosomal genes and genes related to uptake and metabolism of nutrients, and upregulated genes needed for nitrate or phosphonate use. some of the observed changes in gene expression in host-extract-induced cultures are similar to those during attachment of the bacterium to host tissues. other responses indicated defence against toxic metabolites in the extract. tuber extract induced a large gene cluster having homology to type vi secretion genes shown to be virulence determinants in many, but not all, animal and human pathogens. two of the genes in the type vi cluster  were found to be expressed during infection in potato tubers and stems, and mutants with knockouts of the corresponding genes had increased virulence on potato. one of the type vi secretion mutants was further characterized and found  to grow to higher cell density in culture in the presence of host extract and to  produce slightly more extracellular tissue-macerating enzymes than the wild-type  strain. analysis of secreted proteins showed that this type vi mutant was affected in the production of haemolysin-coregulated proteins (hcps), which have  been suggested to be secreted by the type vi pathway in other bacteria. the results suggest that the type vi secretion system of p. atrosepticum is needed for secretion of hcps but not for virulence on its host plant, potato.

TI  == evaluation of reference genes for real-time rt-pcr expression studies in the plant pathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum.
AB  == background: real-time rt-pcr has become a powerful technique to monitor low-abundance mrna expression and is a useful tool when examining bacterial gene  expression inside infected host tissues. however, correct evaluation of data requires accurate and reliable normalisation against internal standards. thus, the identification of reference genes whose expression does not change during the course of the experiment is of paramount importance. here, we present a study where manipulation of cultural growth conditions and in planta experiments have been used to validate the expression stability of reference gene candidates for the plant pathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum, belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae. results: of twelve reference gene candidates tested, four proved to be stably expressed both in six different cultural growth conditions and in planta. two of these genes (reca and ffh), encoding recombinase a and signal recognition particle protein, respectively, proved to be the most stable set of reference genes under the experimental conditions used. in addition, genes proc and gyra, encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase and dna gyrase, respectively, also displayed relatively stable mrna expression levels. conclusion: based on these results, we suggest reca and ffh as suitable candidates for accurate normalisation of real-time rt-pcr data for experiments investigating the plant pathogen p. atrosepticum and potentially other related pathogens.

TI  == the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) is a pathogen of the pea aphid.
AB  == dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi) is a phytopathogenic bacterium causing soft rot diseases on many crops. the sequencing of its genome identified four genes encoding homologues of the cyt family of insecticidal toxins from bacillus  thuringiensis, which are not present in the close relative pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum. the pathogenicity of d. dadantii was tested on the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, and the bacterium was shown to be highly virulent for this insect, either by septic injury or by oral infection. the lethal inoculum dose was calculated to be as low as 10 ingested bacterial cells.  a d. dadantii mutant with the four cytotoxin genes deleted showed a reduced per os virulence for a. pisum, highlighting the potential role of at least one of these genes in pathogenicity. since only one bacterial pathogen of aphids has been previously described (erwinia aphidicola), other species from the same bacterial group were tested. the pathogenic trait for aphids was shown to be widespread, albeit variable, within the phytopathogens, with no link to phylogenetic positioning in the enterobacteriaceae. previously characterized gut  symbionts from thrips (erwinia/pantoea group) were also highly pathogenic to the  aphid, whereas the potent entomopathogen photorhabdus luminescens was not. d. dadantii is not a generalist insect pathogen, since it has low pathogenicity for  three other insect species (drosophila melanogaster, sitophilus oryzae, and spodoptera littoralis). d. dadantii was one of the most virulent aphid pathogens  in our screening, and it was active on most aphid instars, except for the first one, probably due to anatomical filtering. the observed difference in virulence toward apterous and winged aphids may have an ecological impact, and this deserves specific attention in future research.

TI  == identification of a dna restriction-modification system in pectobacterium carotovorum strains isolated from poland.
AB  == aims: polish isolates of pectinolytic bacteria from the species pectobacterium carotovorum were screened for the presence of a dna restriction-modification (r-m) system. methods and results: eighty-nine strains of p. carotovorum were isolated from infected potato plants. sixty-six strains belonged to p. carotovorum ssp. atrosepticum and 23 to p. carotovorum ssp. carotovorum. the presence of restriction enzyme pca17ai, which is an isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease, was observed in all isolates of p. c. atrosepticum but not in p. c. carotovorum. the biochemical properties, pcr amplification, and sequences of the  pca17ai restriction endonuclease and methyltransferase genes were compared with the prototype ecorii r-m system genes. only when dna isolated from cells of p. c. atrosepticum was used as a template, amplification of a 680 bp homologous to the  gene coding ecorii endonuclease. conclusions: endonuclease pca17ai, having a relatively low temperature optimum, was identified. pcr amplification revealed that the nucleotide sequence of genes for ecorii and pca17ai r-m are different. dcm methylation was observed in all strains of pectobacterium and other erwinia species tested. the sequence of a dna fragment coding dcm methylase in p. carotovorum was different from that of escherichia coli. significance and impact  of the study: pca17ai is the first psychrophilic isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease. the presence of specific dcm methylation in chromosomal dna isolated from p. carotovorum is described for the first time. a 680 bp pcr product, unique for p. c. atrosepticum strains, could serve as a molecular marker for detection of these bacteria in environmental samples.

TI  == involvement of n-acylhomoserine lactones throughout plant infection by erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (pectobacterium atrosepticum).
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica is responsible for potato blackleg disease  in the field and tuber soft rot during crop storage. the process leading to the disease occurs in two phases: a primary invasion step followed by a maceration step. bacteria-to-bacteria communication is associated with a quorum-sensing (qs) process based on the production of n-acylhomoserine lactones (hsl). the role of hsl throughout plant infection was analyzed. to this purpose, hsl produced by a specific e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica wild-type strain, which was particularly virulent on potato, were identified. a derivative of this strain that expressed an hsl lactonase gene and produced low amounts of hsl was generated. the comparison of these strains allowed the evaluation of the role of  hsl and qs in disease establishment and development. bacterial growth and motility; activity of proteins secreted by type i, ii, and iii systems; and hypersensitive and maceration reactions were evaluated. results indicated that hsl production and qs regulate only those traits involved in the second stage of  the host plant infection (i.e., tissue maceration) and hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco plants. therefore, the use of qs quenching strategies for biological control in e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica cannot prevent initial infection and multiplication of this pathogen.

TI  == identification of an antibacterial compound, benzylideneacetone, from xenorhabdus nematophila against major plant-pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == an entomopathogenic bacterium, xenorhabdus nematophila, is known to have potent antibiotic activities to maintain monoxenic condition in its insect host for effective pathogenesis and ultimately for optimal development of its nematode symbiont, steinernema carpocapsae. in this study we assess its antibacterial activity against plant-pathogenic bacteria and identify its unknown antibiotics.  the bacterial culture broth had significant antibacterial activity that increased with development of the bacteria and reached its maximum at the stationary growth phase. the antibiotic activities were significant against five plant-pathogenic bacterial strains: agrobacterium vitis, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, and ralstonia solanacearum. the antibacterial factors were extracted with butanol and fractionated using column chromatography with the eluents of different hydrophobic intensities. two active antibacterial subfractions were purified, and the higher active fraction was further fractionated and identified as a single compound of benzylideneacetone (trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one). with heat stability, the synthetic compound showed equivalent antibiotic activity and spectrum to the purified compound. this study reports a new antibiotic compound synthesized by x. nematophila, which is a monoterpenoid compound and active against some gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == elevation of three subspecies of pectobacterium carotovorum to species level: pectobacterium atrosepticum sp. nov., pectobacterium betavasculorum sp. nov. and  pectobacterium wasabiae sp. nov.
AB  == a collection of 42 strains belonging to the five subspecies of pectobacterium carotovorum (subspecies atrosepticum, betavasculorum, carotovorum, odoriferum and wasabiae) and 11 reference and type strains of biovars of pectobacterium chrysanthemi, pectobacterium cacticidum and brenneria paradisiaca were studied by dna-dna hybridization, numerical taxonomy of 120 phenotypic characteristics, serology and new phylogenetic analysis of previously reported sequences from a database of aligned 16s rdna sequences. the p. carotovorum subspecies formed a clade according to neighbour-joining methods, but they formed two paraphyletic clusters according to maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony. however, phylogenetic analysis of 16s rdna sequences alone is not sufficient to justify generic differentiation and therefore, it is proposed to retain the p. carotovorum subspecies in the genus pectobacterium. the strains of p. carotovorum were distributed in four genomospecies: genomospecies 1, harbouring all strains of subsp. atrosepticum, genomospecies 2, including the strains of subsp. betavasculorum isolated from sugar beet, sunflower, potato, hyacinth and artichoke, genomospecies 3, clustering all strains of subsp. wasabiae isolated from wasabi in japan, and genomospecies 4, gathering together strains of subsp. carotovorum and strains of subsp. odoriferum. four strains of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum remained unclustered. biochemical criteria, deduced from a numerical taxonomy study of phenotypic characteristics and serological reactions, allowed discrimination of strains belonging to the four genomospecies. thus, it is proposed that three genomospecies be elevated to species level as pectobacterium atrosepticum sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 1526t =lmg 2386t =ncppb 549t =icmp 1526t), pectobacterium betavasculorum sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 2122t =lmg 2464t =ncppb 2795t =icmp 4226t) and pectobacterium wasabiae sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 3304t =lmg 8404t =ncppb 3701t =icmp 9121t). only two subspecies are maintained within p. carotovorum, subsp. carotovorum (type strain cfbp 2046t =lmg 2404t =ncppb 312t =icmp 5702t) and subsp. odoriferum (type strain cfbp 1878t =lmg 5863t =ncppb 3839t = icmp 11553t), for which discriminating tests are available.

TI  == phylogenetic position of phytopathogens within the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the almost complete 16s rdna sequences of twenty nine plant-associated strains, representing species of the genera erwinia, pantoea and enterobacter were determined and compared with those of other members of the enterobacteriaceae. the species of the genus erwinia may be divided into three phylogenetic groups. cluster i represents the true erwinias and comprises e. amylovora, e. mallotivora, e. persicinus, e. psidii, e. rhapontici and e. tracheiphila. we propose to unite the species of cluster ii, e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e.  carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. carotovora  subsp. odorifera, e. carotovora subsp. wasabiae, e. cacticida, e. chrysanthemi and e. cypripedii in the genus pectobacterium respectively as p. carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum comb. nov.,  p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. wasabiae comb. nov., p. cacticidum comb. nov.,  p. chrysanthemi and p. cypripedii. the species e. alni, e. nigrifluens, e. paradisiaca, e. quercina, e. rubrifaciens and e. salicis, comprising cluster iii, are being classified into a new genus brenneria gen. nov. respectively as b. alni comb. nov., b. nigrifluens comb. nov., b. paradisiaca comb. nov., b. quercina comb. nov., b. rubrifaciens comb. nov. and b. salicis comb. nov. the species of the genus pantoea, included in this study, form a monophyletic unit (cluster iv), closely related with erwinia, whereas the three phytopathogenic species of the genus enterobacter are scattered among the genera citrobacter and klebsiella.

AB  == the influence of the antibiotics chloraphenicol (d-threo-form) and streptomycin sulphate against pectobacterium carotovorum var. atrosepticum (syn. erwinia carotovora) was investigated in vitro and on potato tubers. chloramphenicol showed a greater effect as streptomycinsulphate in the applied concentrations. the success of the control of soft rot is determined by the period between the inoculation and the treatment of the tubers. 6 several strains of p. carotovorum  var. atrosepticum showed a different sensibility to chloramphenicol and streptomycinsulphate.
