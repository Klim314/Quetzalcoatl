TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome distinguishable by 16s rrna gene phylotype quantification.
AB  == aim: to study whether selected bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene phylotypes are capable of distinguishing irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). methods: the faecal microbiota of twenty volunteers with ibs, subdivided into eight diarrhoea-predominant (ibs-d), eight constipation-predominant (ibs-c) and four mixed symptom-subtype (ibs-m) ibs patients, and fifteen control subjects, were analysed at three time-points with a set of fourteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. all assays targeted 16s rrna gene phylotypes putatively associated with ibs, based on 16s rrna gene library sequence analysis. the target phylotypes were affiliated with actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and firmicutes. eight of the target phylotypes had less than 95% similarity to cultured bacterial species according to their 16s rrna gene sequence. the data analyses were made with repeated-measures ancova-type modelling of the data and principle component analysis (pca) with linear mixed-effects models applied to the principal component scores. results: bacterial phylotypes clostridium cocleatum 88%, clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, coprobacillus catenaformis 91%, ruminococcus bromii-like, ruminococcus torques 91%, and r. torques 93% were  detected from all samples analysed. a multivariate analysis of the relative quantities of all 14 bacterial 16s rrna gene phylotypes suggested that the intestinal microbiota of the ibs-d patients differed from other sample groups. the pca on the first principal component (pc1), explaining 30.36% of the observed variation in the ibs-d patient group, was significantly altered from all other sample groups (ibs-d vs control, p = 0.01; ibs-d vs ibs-m, p = 0.00; ibs-d vs ibs-c, p = 0.05). significant differences were also observed in the levels of distinct phylotypes using relative values in proportion to the total amount of bacteria. a phylotype with 85% similarity to c. thermosuccinogenes was quantified in significantly different quantities among the ibs-d and control subjects (-4.08 +/- 0.90 vs -3.33 +/- 1.16, p = 0.04) and ibs-d and ibs-m subjects (-4.08 +/- 0.90 vs -3.08 +/- 1.38, p = 0.05). furthermore, a phylotype with 94% similarity to r. torques was more prevalent in ibs-d patients' intestinal microbiota than in that of control subjects (-2.43 +/- 1.49 vs -4.02 +/- 1.63, p = 0.01). a phylotype with 93% similarity to r. torques was associated with control samples when compared with ibs-m (-2.41 +/- 0.53 vs -2.92 +/- 0.56, p = 0.00). additionally, a r. bromii-like phylotype was associated with ibs-c patients in comparison to control subjects (-1.61 +/- 1.83 vs -3.69 +/- 2.42, p = 0.01). all  of the above mentioned phylotype specific alterations were independent of the effect of time. conclusion: significant phylotype level alterations in the intestinal microbiotas of ibs patients were observed, further emphasizing the possible contribution of the gastrointestinal microbiota in ibs.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis by 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus ruminococcus.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus ruminococcus based on 16s rdna sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the bacillus/clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive line of descent. two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. one group contains r. flavefaciens, r. albus, r. bromii, and r. callidus. the second group  constitutes r. gnavus, r. hansenii, r. lactaris, r. obeum, r. productus and r. torques which together with some clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
