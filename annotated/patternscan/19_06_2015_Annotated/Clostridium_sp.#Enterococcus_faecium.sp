TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == combined administration of bacteriocin-producing, probiotic strain enterococcus faecium ccm7420 with eleutherococcus senticosus and their effect in rabbits.
AB  == the effect of enterococcus faecium ccm7420 (ef) - enterocin-producing and probiotic strain of rabbit origin, eleutherococcus senticosus extract (es) and their combination (es+ef) was determined on selected bacteria in faeces and caecum content, leukocytes phagocytosis, blood biochemistry and growth performance. ninety-six weaned rabbits were divided into 3 experimental (es, ef,  es+ef) and control group (cg). the rabbits in the groups es and ef+es were fed commercial diet enriched with e. senticosus extract (30 g/100 kg feed), rabbits in groups ef and cg were fed untreated diet. the rabbits in the ef and es+ef groups were administered with an overnight culture of e. faecium ccm7420 strain (500 microl/animal/day into water, 109 cfu/ml). the treatment period lasted 21 days. the microbiological examinations in faecal samples confirmed the presence of e. faecium ccm7420 strain. in groups ef and es+ef, the reduction of faecal coliforms, pseudomonas-like sp., clostridium-like sp. and s. aureus was recorded. leucocyte phagocytosis significantly increased in all experimental groups (p < 0.0001) compared to cg. the lowest gpx values were measured in the es+ef group. higher total protein, triglycerides and calcium concentrations were detected in experimental groups compared to cg. the cholesterol concentration decreased in the es group. the highest average daily gain was recorded in ef group; in es+ef the better feed conversion ratio and no mortality was recorded. these results indicated that the dietary supplementation with the e. faecium ccm7420 and e. senticosus extract stimulate the leukocytes phagocytosis and reduces the potential pathogens in rabbits digestive tract without oxidative stress and improve the growth performance.

TI  == influence of a probiotic soy product on fecal microbiota and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in an animal model.
AB  == background: previous work showed that daily ingestion of an aqueous soy extract fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416, supplemented or not with isoflavones, reduced the total cholesterol and non-hdl-cholesterol levels, increased the high-density lipoprotein (hdl) concentration and inhibited the raising of autoantibody against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl ab) and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. objective: the aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiota in order to investigate the possible correlation between fecal microbiota, serum lipid parameters and atherosclerotic lesion development in rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia, that ingested the aqueous soy extract  fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416. methods: the rabbits were randomly allocated to five experimental groups (n = 6): control (c), hypercholesterolemic (h), hypercholesterolemic plus unfermented soy  product (huf), hypercholesterolemic plus fermented soy product (hf) and hypercholesterolemic plus isoflavone-supplemented fermented soy product (hif). lipid parameters and microbiota composition were analyzed on days 0 and 60 of the treatment and the atherosclerotic lesions were quantified at the end of the experiment. the fecal microbiota was characterized by enumerating the lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus spp., enterobacteria and clostridium spp. populations. results: after 60 days of the experiment, intake of the probiotic soy product was correlated with significant increases (p < 0.05) on lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. and enterococcus spp. and a decrease in  the enterobacteria population. a strong correlation was observed between microbiota composition and lipid profile. populations of enterococcus spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium spp. were negatively correlated with total cholesterol, non-hdl-cholesterol, autoantibodies against oxidized ldl (oxldl ab)  and lesion size. hdl-c levels were positively correlated with lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., and enterococcus spp. populations. conclusion: in conclusion, daily ingestion of the probiotic soy product, supplemented or not with isoflavones, may contribute to a beneficial balance of the fecal microbiota  and this modulation is associated with an improved cholesterol profile and inhibition of atherosclerotic lesion development.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the enniatin b, produced by fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on caco-2 cells.
AB  == the enniatins (ens) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of fusarium sp. the en b was purified from extracts of fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (pdb), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (lc) followed by an analytical lc.  the purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) study. the pure fraction of en b was utilized to determine  the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, en b induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms  tested and no significant differences over control were detected when caco-2 cells were exposed to en b, at any of the concentrations used.

TI  == isolation and characterization of enterocin se-k4 produced by thermophilic enterococci, enterococcus faecalis k-4.
AB  == enterococcus sp. k-4, with a bacteriocin-like activity against e. faecium, was isolated from grass silage in thailand. morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic studies clearly identified strain k-4 as a strain of e. faecalis. strain k-4 produced a maximal amount of bacteriocin at 43-45 degrees c. we purified, for the first time, the bacteriocin produced at high temperature by e.  faecalis to homogeneity, using adsorption on cells of the producer strain and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. the bacteriocin, designated enterocin se-k4, is a peptide of about 5 kda as measured by sds-page, and mass spectrometry analysis found the molecular mass of 5356.2, which is in good agreement. the amino acid sequencing of the n-terminal end of enterocin se-k4 showed apparent sequence similarity to class iia bacteriocins. enterocin se-k4 was active against e. faecium, e. faecalis, bacillus subtilis, clostridium beijerinckii, and listeria monocytogenes. enterocin se-k4 is very heat stable.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
