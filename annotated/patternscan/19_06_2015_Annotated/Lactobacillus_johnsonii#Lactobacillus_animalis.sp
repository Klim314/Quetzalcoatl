TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == structural and immunochemical studies of neutral exopolysaccharide produced by lactobacillus johnsonii 142.
AB  == this paper describes the structure of neutral exopolysaccharide (eps) produced by lactobacillus johnsonii 142, strain of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from the intestine of mice with experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). sugar and methylation analyses along with (1)h and (13)c nmr spectroscopy, including two-dimensional (1)h,(1)h cosy, tocsy, noesy, and (1)h,(13)c hsqc experiments revealed that the repeating unit of the eps is a pentasaccharide: -->3)-alpha-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcp-(1-->5)-beta-d-galf-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-( 1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-(1--> the rabbit antiserum raised against whole cells of l. johnsonii 142 reacted with homologous eps, and cross-reacted with exopolysaccharide from lactobacillus animalis/murinus 148 isolated also from mice with ibd, but not reacted with eps of l. johnsonii 151 from healthy mice.

TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
