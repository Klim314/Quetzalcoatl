TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == bisphosphonates enhance bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on bone hydroxyapatite.
AB  == background: because of the suspicion that bisphosphonates enhance bacterial colonization, this study evaluated adhesion and biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans 25175, staphylococcus aureus 6538, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 14454 reference strains on hydroxyapatite coated with clodronate, pamidronate, or zoledronate. material and methods: bacterial strains were cultured on bisphosphonate-coated and noncoated hydroxyapatite discs. after incubation, nonadhered bacteria were removed by centrifugation. biofilm formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial colonization was estimated using quantitative cultures compared by means with kruskal-wallis and post-hoc student-newman-keuls tests. modeling of the interactions between bisphosphonates and hydroxyapatite was performed using the density functional theory method. results: bacterial colonization of the hydroxyapatite discs was significantly higher for all tested strains in the presence of bisphosphonates vs. controls: adherence in the presence of pamidronate was higher than with other bisphosphonates. density functional theory analysis showed that the protonated amine group of pamidronate, which are not present in clodronate or zoledronate, forms two additional hydrogen bonds with hydroxyapatite. moreover, the reactive cationic amino group of pamidronate may attract bacteria by direct electrostatic  interaction. conclusion: increased bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation can promote osteomyelitis, cause failure of dental implants or bisphosphonate-coated  joint prostheses, and complicate bone surgery in patients on bisphosphonates.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so  little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of electron beam irradiated dental irrigants.
AB  == background: the electron beam (e-beam) radiation is considered as an effective means of sterilization of healthcare products as well as to induce the structural changes in the pharmaceutical agents/drug molecules. in addition to structural changes of pharmaceutical it also induces the formation of low molecular weight compounds with altered microbiological, physicochemical and toxicological properties. among the several known medicaments, sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and  chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) are used as irrigants in dentistry to kill the pathogenic microorganisms like enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans inhabiting the oral cavity. objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and stability of e-beam irradiated dental irrigants, naocl and chx. materials and methods: two dental irrigants naocl (1.25% and 2.5%) and chx (1% and 2%) were exposed to various doses of e-beam radiation. the antimicrobial activities of e-beam irradiated irrigants were compared with the non-irradiated (control) irrigants against e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. mutans and c. albicans by disc diffusion method. following the storage, physico-chemical properties of the irrigants were  recorded and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated on human gingival fibroblast cells. result: the irrigants, 1.25% naocl and 1% chx showed significantly increased antimicrobial activity against both e. faecalis, (16+0.0) and s. aureus (25+0.0) after irradiation with 1 kgy e-beam. whereas, 2.5% naocl and 2% chx showed slightly increased antimicrobial activity only against s. aureus (28+0.0). the significant difference was noticed in the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of irradiated and non-irradiated irrigants following the storage for 180 d at 4(0)c. conclusion: the e-beam irradiation increased the antimicrobial activity of irrigants without altering the biocompatibility.

TI  == recent advances in natural product-based anti-biofilm approaches to control infections.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are highly organized surface-associated communities of bacteria encased within an extracellular matrix produced by themselves, capable of growing in connection with different biological or inert surfaces such as artificial joints or catheters. biofilms are commonly associated with many health problems, such as endocarditis, otitis media, periodontitis, prostatitis, and urinary tract infections. several bacteria, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, or fungal pathogen as candida albicans, can form biofilms in the body tissues, leading to different infections. the inherently defensive character of the biofilm is demonstrated by enhanced persistence of bacteria grown in the sessile  mode respect to bacteria grown planktonically. this makes most biofilm- associated infections difficult to eradicate, thus contributing to disease chronicity. since natural products provide a diverse array of chemical structures and possess a wide variety of biological properties, natural resources are worldwide exploited in the search of new pharmaceuticals. in this context bioactive secondary metabolites from natural sources, useful for the new antimicrobial and anti-biofilm drugs, are of interest. in this review, the role of small molecules from plants and marine organisms in inhibiting and/or dispersing bacterial biofilms is discussed, as well as the approaches that have been applied to the discovery of lead small molecules that mediate biofilm development. molecules inhibiting the formation of biofilm may have therapeutic potential. several candidates, as halogenated furanones, 2-amminoimidazole alkaloids and flavonoids have been already isolated and characterized from many plants and from marine organisms.

TI  == microbial biofilms are able to destroy hydroxyapatite in the absence of host immunity in vitro.
AB  == purpose: it is widely thought that inflammation and osteoclastogenesis result in  hydroxyapatite (ha) resorption and sequestrum formation during osseous infections, and microbial biofilm pathogens induce the inflammatory destruction of ha. we hypothesized that biofilms associated with infectious bone disease can  directly resorb ha in the absence of host inflammation or osteoclastogenesis. therefore we developed an in vitro model to test this hypothesis. materials and methods: customized ha discs were manufactured as a substrate for growing clinically relevant biofilm pathogens. single-species biofilms of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans and mixed-species biofilms of c albicans plus s mutans were incubated on ha discs for 72 hours to grow mature biofilms. three different non-biofilm control groups also were established for testing. ha discs were then evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography metrotomography, x-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy with planimetric analysis. in addition, quantitative cultures and ph assessment were performed. analysis of variance was  used to test for significance between treatment and control groups. results: all  investigated biofilms were able to cause significant (p < .05) and morphologically characteristic alterations in ha structure as compared with controls. the highest number of alterations observed was caused by mixed biofilms of c albicans plus s mutans. s mutans biofilm incubated in medium with additional sucrose content was the most detrimental to ha surfaces among single-species biofilms. conclusions: our findings suggest that direct microbial resorption of bone is possible in addition to immune-mediated destruction, which has important  translational implications for the pathogenesis of chronic bone infections and for targeted antimicrobial therapeutics.

TI  == synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and mechanism of a novel hydroxyapatite whisker/nano zinc oxide biomaterial.
AB  == postoperative infections remain a risk factor that leads to failures in oral and  maxillofacial artificial bone transplantation. this study aimed to synthesize and evaluate a novel hydroxyapatite whisker (hapw) / nano zinc oxide (n-zno) antimicrobial bone restorative biomaterial. a scanning electron microscope (sem), energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds) and x-ray diffraction (xrd) were employed to characterize and analyze the material. antibacterial capabilities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, candida albicans and streptococcus mutans were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), and kinetic growth inhibition assays were performed under darkness and simulated solar irradiation. the mode of antibiotic  action was observed by transmission electron microscopy (tem) and confocal laser  scanning microscopy (clsm). the mic and mbc were 0.078-1.250 mg ml(-1) and 0.156-2.500 mg ml(-1), respectively. the inhibitory function on the growth of the microorganisms was achieved even under darkness, with gram-positive bacteria found to be more sensitive than gram-negative, and enhanced antimicrobial activity was exhibited under simulated solar excitation compared to darkness. tem and clsm images revealed a certain level of bacterial cell membrane destruction after treatment with 1 mg ml(-1) of the material for 12 h, causing the leakage of intracellular contents and bacteria death. these results suggest favorable antibiotic properties and a probable mechanism of the biomaterial for the first time, and further studies are needed to determine its potential application as a  postoperative anti-inflammation method in bone transplantation.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

AB  == context: essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. objective: medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. those producing sufficient oil  were screened for activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. materials  and methods: plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. results: fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were  identified. essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to s. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to c. albicans, and 19 species yielded mic values less than the reference drugs. discussion: results suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. oils from cinnamomum zeylanicum blume (lauraceae), citrus aurantiifolia (christm.) swingle (rutaceae), lippia graveolens kunth (verbenaceae), and origanum vulgare l. (lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. conclusion: teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on ricinus communis.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and candida glabrata. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay was performed with r. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. only e. coli was not inhibited by r. communis, but the mic (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. from these results it was determined  the r. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. the commercial dentifrices colgate, trihydral and corega brite were tested for comparative purposes. the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against e. coli. the experimental dentifrices containing r. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against s. mutans, s. aureaus and e. faecallis. the experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against candida spp. and e. coli in any of the tested concentrations. trihydral was the most effective. comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% r. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial and antiinsectan phenolic metabolites of dalea searlsiae.
AB  == continued interest in the chemistry of dalea spp. led to investigation of dalea searlsiae, a plant native to areas of the western united states. methanol extractions of d. searlsiae roots and subsequent chromatographic fractionation afforded the new prenylated and geranylated flavanones malheurans a-d (1-4) and known flavanones (5 and 6). known rotenoids (7 and 8) and isoflavones (9 and 10)  were isolated from aerial portions. structure determination of pure compounds was accomplished primarily by extensive 1d- and 2d-nmr spectroscopy. the absolute configurations of compounds 1-5, 7, and 8 were assigned using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. antimicrobial bioassays revealed significant activity concentrated in the plant roots. compounds 1-6 exhibited mics of 2-8 mug/ml against streptococcus mutans, bacillus cereus, and oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus. aerial metabolites 7-10 were inactive against these organisms, but the presence of 7 and 8 prompted investigation of the antiinsectan activity of d. searlsiae metabolites toward the major crop pest spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). while compounds 1-10 all caused significant reductions in larval growth rates, associated mortality (33-66%) was  highest with flavanone 4 and rotenoids 7 and 8. these findings suggest a differential allocation of antimicrobial and antiinsectan plant resources to root and aerial portions of the plant, respectively.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == effects of easy-to-perform procedures to reduce bacterial colonization with streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus on toothbrushes.
AB  == it is well known that dental caries and periodontitis are the consequence of bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the enamel surface. the continuous presence of bacterial biofilms on the tooth surface results in demineralization of the tooth enamel and induces an inflammatory reaction of the  surrounding gums (gingivitis). the retention and survival of microorganisms on toothbrushes pose a threat of recontamination especially for certain patients at  risk for systemic infections originating from the oral cavity, e.g., after t-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation. thus, the effects of different decolonization schemes on bacterial colonization of toothbrushes were analyzed, in order to demonstrate their applicability to reduce the likelihood of (auto-)reinfections. toothbrushes were intentionally contaminated with standardized suspensions of streptococcus mutans or staphylococcus aureus. afterwards, the toothbrushes were exposed to rinsing under distilled water, rinsing and drying for 24 h, 0.2% chlorhexidine-based decolonization, or ultraviolet (uv) radiation. the remaining colony forming units were compared with freshly contaminated positive controls. each experiment was nine-fold repeated. bi-factorial variance analysis was performed; significance was accepted at p < 0.05. all tested procedures led to a significant reduction of bacteral colonization irrespective of the toothbrush model, the brush head type, or the acitivity state. chlorhexidine-based decolonization was shown to be superior to rinsing and slightly superior to rinsing and drying for 24 h, while uv radiation  was similarly effective as chlorhexidine. uv radiation was slightly less prone to species-dependent limitations of its decolonizing effects by bristle thickness of toothbrushes than chlorhexidin. reduction of bacterial colonization of toothbrushes might reduce the risk of maintaining bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract. accordingly, respective procedures are advisable, particularly as they are cheap and easy to perform.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == a distinguishable role of edna in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  == bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (epss). the extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular dna (edna). here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. a maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). principal-component  analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. the fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. an intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other epss, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact edna, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of eps constituents. this implies that edna modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. importance: the protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical  stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (epss) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic  relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other epss control a second, slower relaxation. extracellular dna, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other epss.

TI  == a role for the dtxr family of metalloregulators in gram-positive pathogenesis.
AB  == given the central role of transition metal ions in a variety of biochemical processes, the colonization, survival, and proliferation of a bacterium within a  host hinges upon its ability to overcome the metal ion deprivation that characterizes nutritional immunity. metalloregulatory, or 'metal-sensing' proteins have evolved in bacteria to mediate metal ion homeostasis by activating  or repressing the expression of genes encoding metal ion transport systems upon binding their cognate metal ion. yet increasing evidence in the literature supports an additional role for these metalloregulatory proteins in pathogenesis. herein, we survey studies on the dtxr family of metalloregulators, namely dtxr (cornyebacterium diphtheriae), slor (streptococcus mutans), mtsr (streptococcus pyogenes), and mntr (staphylococcus aureus) to describe how metalloregulation enables adaptive virulence gene expression within the mammalian host. this research has important implications for drug design, as the generation of hyper-repressive metalloregulatory proteins may represent a mechanism by which to attenuate bacterial pathogenicity. the fact that metalloregulators are unique to  prokaryotes makes these proteins especially attractive therapeutic targets.

TI  == morin inhibits sortase a and subsequent biofilm formation in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is the main etiological agent of dental caries,  and adheres to the tooth surface through the sortase a (srta)-mediated cell wall-anchored protein pac. inhibition of srta activity results in a marked reduction in the adhesion potential of s. mutans, and the frequency of dental caries. morin is a natural plant extract that was previously reported to inhibit  staphylococcus aureus srta activity. here, we demonstrate that morin has an inhibitory effect against s. mutans ua159 srta, with an ic50 of 27.2 +/- 2.6 mum. western blotting demonstrated that 30 mum morin induced the partial release of the pac protein into the supernatant. the biofilm mass of s. mutans was reduced in the presence of 30 mum morin, which was not caused by a decrease in s. mutans  viability. these results indicate that morin might be important as a new agent to prevent caries.

TI  == site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans, strain jh1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. more specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type  a(i) lanthipeptides. mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pva891. substitutions of the n-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in  ring a and intertwined rings c and d were investigated. a truncation and insertion of residues in ring a and intertwined rings c and d were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain micrococcus luteus atcc 10240. mics against streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 27336, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, clostridium difficile uk1, and micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the m. luteus bioassay. this mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.

TI  == microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency  and drug release of microparticles were determined. the antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli). it was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. in vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by fickian diffusion. both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. moreover, the results showed that the strains of e. faecalis, s. pyogenes and s.  mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and e. faecalis to the metronidazole. it was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than  in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. these microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.

TI  == antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of stingless bee melipona scutellaris geopropolis.
AB  == background: geopropolis is a type of propolis containing resin, wax, and soil, collected by threatened stingless bee species native to tropical countries and used in folk medicine. however, studies concerning the biological activity and chemical composition of geopropolis are scarce. in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of the ethanolic extract of geopropolis (eegp) collected by melipona scutellaris and its bioactive fraction against important clinical microorganisms as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity  and chemical profile. methods: the antimicrobial activity of eegp and fractions was examined by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against six bacteria strains as well as  their ability to inhibit streptococcus mutans biofilm adherence. total growth inhibition (tgi) was chosen to assay the antiproliferative activity of eegp and its bioactive fraction against normal and cancer cell lines. the chemical composition of m. scutellaris geopropolis was identified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  results: eegp significantly inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus strains and s. mutans at low concentrations, and its hexane fraction (hf) presented the highest antibacterial activity. also, both eegp and hf inhibited s. mutans biofilm adherence (p < 0.05) and showed selectivity against human cancer cell lines, although only hf demonstrated selectivity at low concentrations. the chemical analyses performed suggest the absence of flavonoids and the presence of benzophenones as geopropolis major compounds. conclusions: the empirical use of this unique type of geopropolis by folk medicine practitioners was confirmed in the present study, since it showed antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential  against the cancer cell lines studied. it is possible that the major compounds found in this type of geopropolis are responsible for its properties.

TI  == psr is involved in regulation of glucan production, and double deficiency of brpa and psr is lethal in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans, the primary causative agent of dental caries, contains two  paralogues of the lytr-cpsa-psr family proteins encoded by brpa and psr, respectively. previous studies have shown that brpa plays an important role in cell envelope biogenesis/homeostasis and affects stress responses and biofilm formation by strep. mutans, traits critical to cariogenicity of this bacterium. in this study, a psr-deficient mutant, tw251, was constructed. characterization of tw251 showed that deficiency of psr did not have any major impact on growth rate. however, when subjected to acid killing at ph 2.8, the survival rate of tw251 was decreased dramatically compared with the parent strain ua159. in addition, tw251 also displayed major defects in biofilm formation, especially during growth with sucrose. when compared to ua159, the biofilms of tw251 were mainly planar and devoid of extracellular glucans. real-time-pcr and western blot analyses revealed that deficiency of psr significantly decreased the expression of glucosyltransferase c, a protein known to play a major role in biofilm formation by strep. mutans. transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that deficiency of brpa caused alterations in cell envelope and cell division, and the most significant defects were observed in tw314, a psr-deficient and brpa-down mutant. no such effects were observed with psr mutant tw251 under similar conditions. these results suggest that while there are similarities in functions  between brpa and psr, distinctive differences also exist between these two paralogues. like bacillus subtilis but different from staphylococcus aureus, a functional brpa or psr is required for viability in strep. mutans.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented manzanilla alorena green table olives.
AB  == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

TI  == synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == isolation and characterization of signermycin b, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase walk.
AB  == the walk (histidine kinase)/walr (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. this system is conserved in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. in this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a walk inhibitor (signermycin b) by screening 10,000 streptomyces extracts. the chemical structure (c(23)h(35)no(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. signermycin b exhibited antimicrobial activity, with mic values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 mum) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 mum) against gram-positive bacteria that possess the walk/walr two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin b against walk in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 mum. to determine the mechanism of action of signermycin b, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two walk domains of bacillus subtilis and competition assay with atp were performed.  the results showed that signermycin b binds to the dimerization domain but not the atp-binding domain of walk. in the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin b did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of walk dimers. these results suggest that signermycin b targets the conserved dimerization domain of walk to inhibit autophosphorylation. in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, signermycin b preferentially controlled the walr regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. these phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the walk/walr system.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == genome-wide essential gene identification in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == a clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. we have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and  systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for streptococcus sanguinis. our results were confirmed by growing s. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive  pathogens, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

AB  == (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), a main constituent of tea catechins, affects gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria differently; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. atomic force microscopy (afm) was used to compare morphological alterations in gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria induced by egcg and by h(2)o(2) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). egcg initially induced aggregates in the cell envelopes of staphylococcus aureus and eventually caused cell lysis, which was not observed in cells treated  with h(2)o(2). it initially induced nanoscale perforations or microscale grooves  in the cell envelopes of escherichia coli o157:h7 which eventually disappeared, similar to e. coli cells treated with h(2)o(2). an e. coli o157:h7 tpx mutant, with a defect in thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (tpx), was more severely  damaged by egcg when compared with its wild type. similar differing effects were  observed in other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria when exposed to egcg;  it caused aggregated in streptococcus mutans, while it caused grooves in pseudomonas aeruginosa. afm results suggest that the major morphological changes  of gram-negative bacterial cell walls induced by egcg depend on h(2)o(2) release. this is not the case for gram-positive bacteria. oxidative stress in gram-negative bacteria induced by egcg was confirmed by flow cytometry.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == additive effects of orexin b and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on ll-37-mediated antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the present study examined the bactericidal effects of orexin b (orxb) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) alone or combined with cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as ll-37, on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus. the bactericidal effect of orxb or vip alone was detected in low nacl concentration, but attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150 mm). however, such attenuated bactericidal  activities of orxb and vip in 150 mm nacl were regained by adding ll-37. therefore, our results indicate that vip and orxb appear to mediate bactericidal  effects in concert with ll-37 in the physiological context of mucosal tissue.

TI  == susceptibility of candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans biofilms to photodynamic inactivation: an in vitro study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate specific effects of photodynamic inactivation (pdi) using methylene blue as photosensitizer and low-power laser irradiation on the viability of single-, dual-, and three-species biofilms formed by c. albicans, s. aureus, and s. mutans. biofilms were grown in acrylic discs immersed in sterile brain heart infusion broth (bhi) containing 5% sucrose, inoculated with microbial suspension (10(6) cells/ml) and incubated for 5 days. on the fifth day, the effects of the methylene blue (mb) photosensitizer at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for 5 min and ingaalp laser (660 nm) for 98 s, alone and conjugated were evaluated. next, the discs were placed in tubes with sterile  physiological solution [0.9% sodium chloride (nacl)] and sonicated for to disperse the biofilms. ten-fold serial dilutions were carried and aliquots seeded in selective agar, which were then incubated for 48 h. then the numbers cfu/ml (log(10)) were counted and analyzed statistically (anova, tukey test, p < 0.05).  scanning electron microscopy (sem) on discs treated with pdi and control biofilms groups was performed. significant decreases in the viability of all microorganisms were observed for biofilms exposed to pdi mediated by mb dye. reductions (log(10)) of single-species biofilms were greater (2.32-3.29) than the association of biofilms (1.00-2.44). scanning electron microscopy micrographs suggested that lethal photosensitization occurred predominantly in the outermost  layers of the biofilms. the results showed that pdi mediated by mb dye, might be  a useful approach for the control of oral biofilms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite-based irrigating solutions.
AB  == purpose: the objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of three different naocl-based endodontic irrigating solutions: a 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution; and two new irrigating solutions, a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with the addition of a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant; and a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate. methods: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic irrigating solutions by the agar disc diffusion test. paper disks were saturated with each one of the tested solutions (at room temperature and pre-warmed at 45 degrees c) and placed onto culture agar-plates pre-adsorbed  with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the growth inhibition zones around each irrigating solution were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. results: the results were significantly different among the tested irrigating solutions: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution produced the  highest inhibition areas; 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed the lowest zones of inhibition. conclusions: even if all tested irrigating solution possessed antibacterial activity versus all tested bacterial  strains, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed lower in vitro efficacy than 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution.

TI  == photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  == the relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of h(2)o(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. h(2)o(2) (1 m) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. s. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 m h(2)o(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts  of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. treatment of s. mutans in  a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 mum hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.

TI  == light insensitive silver(i) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  == ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject  of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus  aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm  formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of brazilian medicinal plant extracts against pathogenic microorganisms of interest to dentistry.
AB  == this study evaluated the susceptibility of oral pathogenic microorganisms candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to brazilian medicinal plant extracts of schinus terebinthifolius (aroeira), croton campestris (velame), lafoensia pacari (pacari), centaurium erythraea (centaurea), stryphnodendron adstringens (barbatimao), and anacardium humile (cajuzinho-docerrado), as compared to standardized antimicrobial agents (nystatin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline hydrochloride). ethanol, hexane and butane fractions from stem barks, rinds, leaves, and/or roots were extracted and tested. antimicrobial diffusion agar test and mic were performed according to clsi. after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees  c, the diameter of inhibition zones and spectrophotometer readings were measured  and compared. the results were reported as means +/- standard deviation (m +/- sd). with the exception of five extracts that showed no antimicrobial activity, all the extracts tested showed antimicrobial activity, in different levels. this  study suggests that extracts from the plants tested could be an alternative therapeutic option for infectious conditions of the oral cavity, such as denture  stomatitis, dental caries, and periodontitis.

TI  == comparative effect of chlorhexidine and some mouthrinses on bacterial biofilm formation on titanium surface.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and commonly used mouthrinses to single- and poly-species biofilms by s. mutans, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, on titanium discs of grade iv. the formation of single- and poly-species biofilms at 16.5, 40.5 and 64.5-h incubation on titanium surface was evaluated by plate count (cfu ml(-)(1)) before and after exposure to chx and four mouthrinses (curasept, listerine, meridol and  buccagel) and expressed as percentage of inhibitory activity (ia%). the application of the different anti-plaque formulations on biofilm can reduce the adhesion of bacteria to titanium surface with different degrees. the higher efficacy was observed for listerine that shows ia% = 100 on the biofilm formed by s. mutans at 16.5 h. log count of cfu was dependent to culture time and four mouthrinses for s. mutans and s. aureus, whilst was not dependent to culture time but to mouthrinses for p. aeruginosa. in general, the efficacy was particularly lesser to poly-species biofilms; no statistical differences were evidenced between all the mouthrinses and chx as control group. the tested mouthrinses, compared to reference chx 0.2%, have demonstrated a significant lower antibacterial activity than listerine towards the experimental biofilms. this "in vitro" biofilm model should prove extremely useful for pre-clinical testing of anti-plaque agents, which inhibit biofilm formation, can prevent subsequent implant failure.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == evaluation of alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes considering that most of the previously proposed methods are expensive and cannot be easily implemented. two-hundred toothbrushes with standardized dimensions and bristles were included in the study. the toothbrushes were divided into 20 experimental groups (n = 10), according to microorganism considered and chemical agent used. the toothbrushes were contaminated in vitro by standardized suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus or candida albicans. the following disinfectants were tested: 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% white vinegar, a triclosan-containing dentifrice solution, and a perborate-based tablet solution.  the disinfection method was immersion in the disinfectant for 10 min. after the disinfection procedure, the number of remaining microbial cells was evaluated. the values of cfu/toothbrush of each group of microorganism after disinfection were compared by kruskal-wallis anova and dunn's test for multiple comparisons (5%). the chlorhexidine digluconate solution was the most effective disinfectant. the triclosan-based dentifrice solution promoted a significant reduction of all microorganisms' counts in relation to the control group. as to the disinfection with 50% vinegar, a significant reduction was observed for all the microorganisms, except for c. albicans. the sodium perborate solution was the less effective against the tested microorganisms. solutions based on triclosan-containing dentifrice may be considered effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and an easily applicable alternative for the disinfection of toothbrushes. the vinegar solution reduced the presence of s. aureus, s. mutans and s. pyogenes on toothbrushes.

TI  == the effects of farnesol on staphylococcus aureus biofilms and osteoblasts. an in  vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial biofilms play a major role in chronic orthopaedic infections. recently, farnesol (an antifungal agent) has been shown to express antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans.  however, the effects of farnesol on the formation of bacterial biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials and its effects on osteoblasts have not been investigated, to our knowledge, and are therefore the focus of this study. methods: biofilms of staphylococcus aureus (seattle 1945(gfpuvr)) were grown on titanium alloy discs. the effects of soluble farnesol on biofilm formation with or without gentamicin were examined with fluorescence microscopy and in quantitative cultures. the effect of farnesol coated on titanium alloy discs was  also investigated, as was the effect of the agent on mc3t3-e1 pre-osteoblastic cells cultured on titanium alloy discs. results: soluble farnesol at a 30-mm concentration reduced the number of viable bacteria 10(4)-fold and completely inhibited biofilm formation. low concentrations of soluble farnesol (0.03 to 3 mm) did not inhibit biofilm formation and did not potentiate the effect of a submaximal concentration of gentamicin. dried farnesol on titanium alloy discs reduced the number of viable bacteria fiftyfold. the effect of farnesol on bacterial biofilm formation lasted for at least three days. soluble farnesol added after the biofilm had already formed also reduced the final number of viable bacteria, by fifty-six-fold. soluble farnesol (3-mm and 30-mm concentrations) inhibited spreading of the mc3t3-e1 cells. conclusions: in vitro, a high concentration of farnesol (30 mm) shows antimicrobial properties against bacterial biofilms; however, it also has a negative effect on pre-osteoblasts. farnesol can also express antimicrobial activity when predried on titanium discs  and when added to preformed biofilms.

AB  == problem: irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impressions are dimensionally unstable and difficult to disinfect. purpose: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorite disinfectant (presept) and a new formulation chlorine dioxide based disinfectant (aseptrol) on irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impression material. materials and methods: alginate blocks were contaminated with candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans and bacillus subtilis spores. the blocks were placed either  in sterile distilled water as control, or in 48-ppm aseptrol or presept solution  containing organic matter. immersion times were 30 seconds, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 5 minutes. the blocks were then placed in sterile 0.5% sodium thiosulphate neutralizer and surviving organisms were harvested and counted using the serial dilution technique followed by culturing on appropriate media. the anti-microbial efficacy of the solution was tested for 37 days. results: there was a consistent  significant reduction (99.99%) in all tests of vegetative organisms after immersion in the aseptrol for 30 seconds, and for spores after 1.5 minutes. it was effective against vegetative organisms for up to 27 days for a 30-second exposure. presept significantly reduced (99.99%) c. albicans, s. aureus and s. mutans in 30 seconds, p. aeruginosa in 60 seconds, but for b. subtilis spores took at least 5 minutes. it was effective against vegetative organisms for >37 days for a 30-second exposure. conclusion: within the limits of this study it was found that both compounds effectively disinfected the alginate in the presence of organic material, but that aseptrol did so after an immersion time of only 1.5 minutes. this immersion time is less likely to affect the dimensional properties  of the impression material. clinical implications: the short action time of aseptrol may make it ideal for the disinfection of alginate impressions, and it may also find many uses for disinfection and possible sterilisation.

TI  == bioassay guided purification of the antimicrobial fraction of a brazilian propolis from bahia state.
AB  == background: brazilian propolis type 6 (atlantic forest, bahia) is distinct from the other types of propolis especially due to absence of flavonoids and presence  of other non-polar, long chain compounds, but presenting good in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity. several authors have suggested that fatty acids found in this propolis might be responsible for its antimicrobial activity; however, so far no evidence concerning this finding has been reported in the literature. the goals of this study were to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the main pure fatty acids in the ethanolic extract and fractions and elucidate the chemical nature of the bioactive compounds isolated from brazilian propolis type 6. methods: brazilian propolis type 6 ethanolic extract (eep), hexane fraction (h-fr), major fatty acids, and isolated sub-fractions were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc), high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (hrgc-fid), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). three sub-fractions of h-fr were obtained through preparative hplc. antimicrobial activity of eep, h-fr, sub-fractions, and fatty acids were tested against staphyloccus aureus atcc 25923 and streptococcus mutans ingbritt 1600 using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). results: eep and h-fr inhibited the growth of the microorganisms tested; nevertheless, no antimicrobial activity was found for the major fatty acids. the three sub-fractions (1, 2, and  3) were isolated from h-fr by preparative hplc and only sub-fraction 1 showed antimicrobial activity. conclusion: a) the major fatty acids tested were not responsible for the antimicrobial activity of propolis type 6; b) sub-fraction 1, belonging to the benzophenone class, was responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in the present study. the identification of the bioactive compound will improve the development of more efficient uses of this natural product.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == the macrophage scavenger receptor cd163 functions as an innate immune sensor for  bacteria.
AB  == the plasma membrane glycoprotein receptor cd163 is a member of the scavenger receptor cystein-rich (srcr) superfamily class b that is highly expressed on resident tissue macrophages in vivo. previously, the molecule has been shown to act as a receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes and to mediate cell-cell interactions between macrophages and developing erythroblasts in erythroblastic islands. here, we provide evidence for a potential role for cd163 in host defense. in particular, we demonstrate that cd163 can function as a macrophage receptor for bacteria. cd163 was shown to bind both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and a previously identified cell-binding motif in the second scavenger  domain of cd163 was sufficient to mediate this binding. expression of cd163 in monocytic cells promoted bacteria-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. finally, newly generated antagonistic antibodies against cd163 were able to potently inhibit cytokine production elicited by bacteria in freshly isolated human monocytes. these findings identify cd163 as a macrophage receptor for bacteria and suggest that, during bacterial infection, cd163 on resident tissue macrophages acts as an innate immune sensor and inducer of local inflammation.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == an analysis of the persistent presence of opportunistic pathogens on patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts.
AB  == purpose: this study aimed to assess the persistent presence of microorganisms on  patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts, while highlighting important human pathogens such as candida, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and pseudomonas aeruginosa. materials and methods: the practices and opinions regarding cross-infection control from 59 general dentists in japan were obtained via a questionnaire. alginate impressions were made from 56 patients. using a brain heart infusion agar medium, impression and imprint cultures were carried out to visualize the microbial contamination on the surfaces of the impressions and gypsum casts, respectively. the colonies on the surfaces of the 30 impression cultures and 26 imprint cultures were collected by swabbing and then inoculated onto selective agar plates to detect streptococci, staphylococci, candida, mrsa, and p aeruginosa. results: the questionnaire showed that only 54%  of general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics, and only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of mrsa or p aeruginosa on impressions and gypsum casts. the impression/imprint cultures grew a large number of visible bacterial colonies on all of impression/gypsum cast samples investigated. selective agar cultures demonstrated the presence of streptococci (100, 100%), staphylococci (56.7, 65.4%), candida (30, 46.2%), mrsa (26.7, 15.4%), and p aeruginosa (6.7, 7.7%) on the impressions and the gypsum casts, respectively. conclusions: this investigation showed that patient-derived dental  impressions and gypsum casts are contaminated with numerous microbes, including candida, mrsa, and p aeruginosa, which are known pathogens responsible for nosocomial and/or life-threatening infection in the immunocompromised host.

TI  == glomerulonephritis causing acute renal failure during the course of bacterial infections. histological varieties, potential pathogenetic pathways and treatment.
AB  == to illustrate diagnostic approaches, potential pathogenetic differences, epidemiological implications and therapeutic dilemmas posed by glomerulonephritis (gn) with acute renal failure (arf) complicating bacterial infections, we analyzed the course of four male patients, aged 53-71 years, who developed gn and arf following bacterial infections. the first two patients developed gn with immunoglobulin a (iga) deposits after infections with hospital-acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). clinical, serologic and histological features, classification of gn and treatment differed between the two patients. in the first patient, serological features (transient hypocomplementemia, normal serum protein electrophoresis) and histological findings were consistent with typical post-infectious gn. treatment with antibiotics alone resulted in normalization of the renal function despite the severity of arf, which required temporary hemodialysis. in the second patient, serological features (normal serum complement, polyclonal elevation of gamma globulins) and histological picture of the kidneys were characteristic of iga nephropathy with fibrocellular crescents, and skin histology was consistent with  vasculitis. cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were added to the antibiotics, with partial improvement of the renal failure. the third patient developed simultaneous acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal gn causing severe arf requiring hemodialysis. complete recovery of arf and migratory polyarthritis followed initiation of corticosteroids. the fourth patient developed arf and cerebral vasculitis following a prolonged course of streptococcus mutans endocarditis with delayed diagnosis. he also developed multiple serological abnormalities including elevated titers of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies  (anca), antinuclear antibodies (ana), anti-phospholipid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and modest hypocomplementemia. kidney biopsy revealed anca-mediated focal gn with 10% crescents and acute interstitial nephritis. treatment with cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids, but not with antibiotics alone, resulted in resolution of both the arf and the features of cerebral vasculitis. gn following bacterial infections may have various pathogenetic mechanisms, presents complex diagnostic challenges, may be preventable in the case of hospital-acquired mrsa, and, in addition to antibiotics, may require immunosuppressive therapy in carefully selected and monitored cases.

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == isolation, identification, and quantification of roasted coffee antibacterial compounds.
AB  == coffee brew is a widely consumed beverage with multiple biological activities due both to naturally occurring components and to the hundreds of chemicals that are  formed during the roasting process. roasted coffee extract possesses antibacterial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans, whereas green coffee extract exhibits no such activity. the naturally occurring coffee compounds, such as chlorogenic acids and caffeine, cannot therefore be responsible for the significant antibacterial activity exerted by coffee beverages against both bacteria. the very low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) found for standard  glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl compounds formed during the roasting process points to these alpha-dicarbonyl compounds as the main agents responsible for the antibacterial activity of brewed coffee against sa. aureus and st. mutans. however, their low concentrations determined in the beverage account for only 50% of its antibacterial activity. the addition of caffeine, which has weak intrinsic antibacterial activity, to a mixture of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds at the concentrations found in coffee demonstrated that caffeine synergistically enhances the antibacterial activity of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and that glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl in the presence of caffeine account for the  whole antibacterial activity of roasted coffee.

TI  == activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. to address this problem, we have examined  the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. we demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mpe), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and candida species found in oral infections. since streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against s. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. our results indicate that mpe can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. incubation with 5 nm mpe prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nm mpe reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. structure-function analyses suggest that mpe inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds dna at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act  both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular  antibiotic, similar to other amps. we conclude that mpe and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.

TI  == reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive rgd modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  == ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. poly(l-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (pll-g-peg) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. pll-g-peg can be functionalized with bioligands such as rgd (arg-gly-asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized pll-g-peg and rgd-peptide functionalized pll-g-peg reduced the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to titanium (ti) surfaces. the present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. the different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and fluorescence light microscopy (fm). the adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on ti surfaces coated with pll-g-peg compared to uncoated ti surfaces even in the presence of rgd. the percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. therefore, coating surfaces with pll-g-peg/peg-rgd allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.

TI  == tea catechins as a potential alternative anti-infectious agent.
AB  == besides well-known health benefits, green tea catechins exert antimicrobial and antiviral activities against a variety of infectious agents. although the detailed mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of tea catechins remains to be explored, the broad-spectrum activity of catechins may involve common target(s),  such as the cell membrane, in addition to specific targets for each pathogen. this extends to antiviral activities, where many pronounced activities were reported for enveloped viruses. yet, the effectiveness of tea catechins as antimicrobials is compromised by relative chemical instability and poor bioavailability. whether tea catechins will emerge as a viable option as alternative medicine or as a synergistic combination therapy with pre-existing antivirals or antibiotics must therefore depend on a method of delivery that ensures its stability and bioavailability. however, green tea may provide an option for mitigating the health and economic burdens associated with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, especially considering the paucity of effective control measures. considering the zoonotic nature of newly arising infectious diseases, the dual use of green tea components in both humans and livestock may reduce animal-human transmission, which would complement the current management of infectious diseases.

AB  == the tear film is a complex mixture of secreted fluid, ions, proteins, glycoproteins, and lipids that lubricates and protects the ocular surface. recently, several antimicrobial peptides have been described in the tear fluid. in this study, we describe the presence of the large secreted glycoprotein gp340  in the tear film. western blot analysis showed that gp340 is abundant in secreted tears and in the lacrimal glands. lesser amounts of gp340 were detected in the cornea and conjunctiva. consistent with western blot data, reverse transcription-pcr and real-time quantitative pcr showed that gp340 transcripts were abundant in lacrimal gland tissue and were also present in the cornea and conjunctiva. immunohistochemistry localized gp340 to the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland and the deeper layers of the conjunctival epithelium. gp340 was not detected in conjunctival goblet cells. in the cornea, gp340 was present only  in a peripheral band of basal epithelial cells, suggesting that gp340 may play a  role in the cycle of corneal epithelial renewal. to determine if tear film gp340  may function as a bacterial agglutinin as it does in saliva, tears were incubated with streptococcal cells and the formation of bacterial aggregates was monitored. addition of tears to late-exponential-phase streptococcus mutans cells resulted in time- and dose-dependent aggregation of the bacteria. furthermore, western blot analysis confirmed the presence of cell-associated gp340 in isolated bacterial aggregates. the ocular pathogen staphylococcus aureus, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa, also aggregated when incubated with tears. these results  suggest that gp340 is a normal component of the tear film and that the glycoprotein may function as a bacterial agglutinin.

TI  == antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans (ingbritt), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), lactobacillus casei (atcc 393), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). the results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (f=38.290; p<0.01). the six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. among them, longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by zno whisker  antibacterial complex (znow) at-83, ionpure-h, basic magnesium hypochlorite, znow at-88 and antim-ams2. the broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.

TI  == biofilms: a role in recurrent mastitis infections?
AB  == mastitis remains one the most important diseases in dairy cattle despite the progress made in improving general udder health in recent years. epidemiological  studies have revealed that following treatment with antimicrobials, bacteriological cure rates vary between 0% and 80% but with no evidence of a significant loss of activity of the major classes of antibiotics licensed for the treatment of bovine mastitis. recurrent infections are often attributable to biofilm growth of bacteria and this review provides an overview of those mechanisms related to bacterial biofilm growth in mastitis. biofilm formation is  accompanied by significant genetic and subsequent physiological changes in the microorganisms resulting, inter alia, in a loss of sensitivity to virtually all classes of antibiotics.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == copy-like copper inducible repressors are putative 'winged helix' proteins.
AB  == copy of enterococcus hirae is a well characterized copper-responsive repressor involved in copper homeostasis. in the absence of copper, it binds to the promoter. in high copper, the copz copper chaperone donates copper to copy, thereby releasing it from the promoter and allowing transcription of the downstream copper homeostatic genes of the cop operon. we here show that the copy-like repressors from e. hirae, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus mutans  have similar affinities not only for their native promoters, but also for heterologous cop promoters. copz of l. lactis accelerated the release of copy from the promoter, suggesting that copz of l. lactis acts as copper chaperone, similar to copz in e. hirae. the consensus binding motif of the copy-like repressors was shown to be tacaxxtgta. the same binding motif is present in promoters controlled by blai of bacillus licheniformis, meci of staphylococcus aureus and related repressors. blai and meci have known structures and belong to  the family of 'winged helix' proteins. in the n- terminal domain, they share significant sequence similarity with copy of e. hirae. moreover, they bind to the same tacaxxtgta motif. nmr analysis of the n-terminal dna binding domain of copy  of l. lactis showed that it contained the same alpha-helical content like the same regions of blai and meci. these findings suggest that the dna binding domains of copy-like repressors are also of the 'winged helix' type.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of monocaprin: a monoglyceride with potential use as a denture disinfectant.
AB  == monocaprin is a 1-monoglyceride of capric acid that has antimicrobial activity against enveloped viruses, certain bacteria, and the yeast candida albicans. solutions containing monocaprin were formulated and tested in vitro against a number of micro-organisms, including species found in the oral cavity and common  pathogenic species. the antimicrobial activity of monocaprin was tested with strains growing on a surface as well as in the planktonic phase. micro-organisms  tested were: streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. two sets of  dilutions were prepared for each test strain; one to be inoculated with the micro-organism growing in the planktonic phase and the other with the same strain growing on a filter paper disk. control solutions were also prepared to find out  if any of the excipients were affecting the microbicidal effect of monocaprin. test strains growing on the filter paper surface were less sensitive to monocaprin than the same strain growing in its planktonic phase. c. albicans was  the micro-organism that was most sensitive to monocaprin, but s. mutans also showed appreciable sensitivity. the indication that monocaprin may have potential as a topical agent against candida was tested in an open study of denture disinfection in 32 patients attending a geriatric daycare centre. a significant,  but short-term, reduction in counts of candida on the fitting surface of full dentures was observed.

TI  == inducible antisense rna expression in the characterization of gene functions in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == in order to examine gene function in streptococcus mutans, we have recently initiated an antisense rna strategy. toward this end, we have now constructed and evaluated three escherichia coli-s. mutans shuttle expression vectors with the frua and scrb promoters from s. mutans, as well as the tetr-controlled teto promoter from staphylococcus aureus. among these, the teto/tetr system proved to  be the most tightly controlled promoter. by using this shuttle plasmid system, modulation of gene function by inducible antisense rna expression was demonstrated for comc antisense fragments of different sizes as well as for distinct gtfb antisense fragments. it was demonstrated that the size, but not the relative position, of an antisense dna fragment is important in mediating the antisense phenomenon. furthermore, by constructing and screening random dna libraries with the tet expression shuttle system, 78 growth-retarded transformants harboring antisense dna fragments were also identified. almost all  of them corresponded to homologous essential genes in other bacteria. in addition, a novel essential gene, the coae gene, encoding dephospho-coenzyme a kinase, which is involved in the final step of coenzyme a catabolism in s. mutans, was identified and characterized. these results suggest that the antisense rna strategy can be useful for identifying novel essential genes in s.  mutans bacteria as well as further characterizing the physiology (including potential virulence factors) of these organisms.

AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == the putative autolysin regulator lytr in streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. colonization of the oral cavity by s. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. sucrose-independent adhesion of s. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an orf (orf0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to lytr, a regulator of autolysin activity in bacillus subtilis. the protein encoded by orf0317, lytr, belongs to the lytr/cpsa/psr protein family. this family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in lactococcus lactis and in  the pathogenic properties of streptococcus pneumoniae. to investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of s. mutans, a lytr mutant was constructed. the mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that lytr attenuates s. mutans autolytic activity, possibly  through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. no defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the lytr mutant. however, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytr was found.

TI  == reduction of salivary s. aureus and mutans group streptococci by a preprocedural  chlorhexidine rinse and maximal inhibitory dilutions of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium.
AB  == objectives: staphylococcus aureus and mutans group streptococci can cause, among  many other diseases, infective endocarditis and postoperative infections. the reduction of the number of these microorganisms in the oral cavity prior to surgical procedures has been related to a decreased incidence of such occurrences. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single preprocedural rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (periogard) on the salivary counts of s aureus and mutans group streptococci and determine maximal inhibitory dilutions (mid) of this and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride solution (cepacol). method and materials: saliva was collected from 60 patients before and after 30-second mouthrinses with chlorhexidine and cultured in appropriate media. the number of microorganisms was calculated based on the colony-forming units (cfus). for the in vitro mid determination, 25 strains of s aureus were seeded in the media containing one of the sequential dilutions of both antiseptics. results: s  aureus, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus were initially isolated  from 45%, 63%, and 28% of the patients, respectively. after rinsing with chlorhexidine, the reductions in the cfus were above 99% for all the studied microorganisms. in the mid determination, all isolates were inhibited with 1/20 and 1/80 dilutions of cetylpyridinium and chlorhexidine, respectively. dose-response curves were obtained for both antiseptics. conclusion: single preprocedural chlorhexidine mouthrinse is effective in reducing salivary microorganisms to levels currently considered safe to perform invasive procedures, and it is still effective in a 1:80 dilution.

TI  == cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == principles: quorum sensing (qs) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. qs-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. in the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. in the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. while gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. descriptions: examples of qs-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis are given. in these bacteria, qs-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. applications: the high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. the options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in s. aureus qs-regulation.

TI  == degradation of antimicrobial histatin-variant peptides in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == histidine-free variants of salivary histatin 5 have a broad antimicrobial activity against various bacteria. in relation to a possible therapeutic application, we were interested in the susceptibility of these small peptides (14 amino acids long) to microbial proteinases and whether this affects their antimicrobial activity. analyses by sds-page of supernatants of peptide-bacteria  incubation showed a reduction in protein bands within 15 minutes' incubation, as  a result of cellular internalization. degradation products of dhvar1 and dhvar2 appeared within one hour in the supernatants of streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus. in contrast, the variants dhvar3 and dhvar4 were more resistant to degradation under the same conditions. maldi-tof analyses identified cleavage of dhvar1 and dhvar2 at glu(6). the n-terminal peptide part (1-6) of dhvar1 and 2 showed no bactericidal activity, while peptide fragment (7-14) showed a highly reduced bactericidal activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of newly  developed amphiphilic lipids and dna/lipid complexes against two types of oral bacteria and two types of hospital infection bacteria. nine amphiphilic lipids were quantitatively prepared from the reaction of n-alkyl alcohol, alpha-amino acids, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. nine dna-lipid complexes were prepared by the  simple mixing of dna and amphiphilic lipids. the dna-lipid complexes were insoluble in water. the antibacterial activity of lipids and dna-lipid complexes  against porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by the disk-diffusion method. seven artificial lipids showed antibacterial behavior; in particular, the lipids prepared from n-decyl alcohol and glycine and from n-decyl alcohol and l-alanine  showed antibacterial activity against the four bacterial strains used in this study. on the other hand, the lipids of glutamic acid derivatives did not show any antibacterial activity against the four bacteria strains except for the lipid with an n-octyl group. five dna-lipid complexes also had an antibacterial effect. the complex prepared from dna and glycine decyl ester p-toluenesulfonic acid salt exhibited antibacterial activity against the four types of bacteria strains. in this study it was found that lipids and dna-lipid complexes with a mono-decyl group or a mono-dodecyl group have more favorable antibacterial activity.

TI  == identification of immunodominant helicobacter pylori proteins with reactivity to  h. pylori-specific egg-yolk immunoglobulin.
AB  == the importance of hens eggs as a source of specific antibodies (igy) is well recognized. the protective effect of igy obtained from hens immunized with helicobacter pylori whole-cell lysate has been reported for the control of h. pylori infection. however, igy produced by whole-cell lysates presents the possibility of cross-reactivity with other bacteria, including the normal human flora, and this could decrease the efficiency of igy. in the present study, the immunodominant proteins of h. pylori with reactivity to h. pylori-specific igy (igy-hp) were identified. igy obtained from hens immunized with various fractions of h. pylori proteins was isolated and purified, titres of igy-hp against h. pylori were determined and cross-reactivity between igy-hp and normal human bacteria was examined by western blot analysis. finally, immunodominant h. pylori proteins were identified by lc/ms analysis. igy obtained 2 months after immunization with h. pylori whole-cell lysate showed the highest antibody titre.  five immunodominant proteins were identified that were strongly reactive to igy-hp: urease beta-subunit (62 kda), heat-shock protein 60 (60 kda), urease alpha-subunit (26 kda), probable peroxiredoxin (22 kda) and probable thiol peroxidase (18 kda). immunization of hens with the immunodominant proteins identified would produce a more specific igy against h. pylori.

TI  == different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or  indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype  strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19,  m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against  staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m)  were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by  several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  == bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of streblus asper leaves. the extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards streptococcus, especially to streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. the extract had no effect on cultures of  escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus coagulase positive, staphylococcus coagulase negative, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia pseudomeallei and candida albicans. the minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of s. asper extract against 10(8) cfu/ml of s. mutans was 2 mg/ml. the active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 da. the potential for using s. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain  heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm  wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  == two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (hrps) in human parotid saliva. the results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of hrps  against streptococcus mutans mt6r, but also showed for the first time that hrps were effectively antibacterial to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. among hrps, hrp3, hrp5 and hrp6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against s. mutans, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, whereas hrp1 was only effective against e.  coli. s. sanguis was resistant to the action of hrps. these results suggest that  hrps are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.

TI  == in vitro testing of a denture cleaning method using ozone.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the microbicidal effect of gaseous ozone with that of ozonated water in order to determine its usefulness as a method for  disinfecting dentures. although a large number of research studies have been done on the bactericidal effect of ozone, little is known about its microbicidal effects on oral microorganisms. therefore, we tested the effect of ozone on three standard strains of oral microorganisms: streptococcus mutans (strain iid 973), staphylococcus aureus (strain 209-p), and candida albicans (strain lam 14322). when the gaseous ozone injection method was used, the numbers of cells of all three strains decreased to 1/10(5) at 1 min, and by 3 min they were below the detection limit. thus, the microbicidal effect of gaseous ozone was ascertained in a short time. in contrast, when ozonated water at 1 ppm and 3 ppm was used, c. albicans decreased to 1/10. a 700 mg/h ozone production level was needed to prepare 1 ppm ozonated water, whereas 20 mg/h of ozone was required by the gaseous ozone generator. these findings indicate that direct exposure to gaseous  ozone seems to be a more effective microbicide compared with ozonated water, and  that gaseous ozone can be clinically useful for disinfection of dentures.

TI  == selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  == fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. staphylococcus aureus h cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide  to h2o2 killing at acid ph values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. in contrast, fluoride had little effect on h2o2 killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to h2o2 than is s. aureus in the absence of fluoride. fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 over a wide ph range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced h2o2 killing in the presence of fluoride. in addition, we found that catalase-positive s. aureus or neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative s. mutans against killing by h2o2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride  or sulfide under acid conditions. thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase  reduced protection. these findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  == a rosemary extract commercially exploited (oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. for gram-positive bacteria, the mic of the ethanolic solution was 1% for leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for bacillus cereus. it slowed the growth of penicillium roquefortii and botrytis cinerea. up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts rhodotorula glutinis and cryptococcus laurentii. antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. the mic was reduced by low ph, high nacl contents, and  low temperatures. low ph and high nacl concentration had a synergistic effect on  the mic of the rosemary extract for s. aureus. lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. the inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees c). the  natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. the antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.

AB  == biological effect of static magnetic field was investigated by using ferrite magnets to conduct a magnetic field exposure experiment on three species of bacteria: streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the  effects were evaluated by culturing the bacteria and determining their growth rate, the maximum numbers of bacteria, and [3h]-thymidine incorporation. the results showed that the ferrite magnet caused strength-dependent decreases in the growth rate and growth maximum number of bacteria for s. mutans and s. aureus when cultured under anaerobic conditions, but that their growth was not inhibited under aerobic conditions. in addition, [3h]-thymidine was added after culturing each of the species of bacteria for 18 h. after that, culture was continued until 24 h, and changes in [3h]-thymidine incorporation were investigated. but no effect of the magnetic fields was detected. these findings suggested that oxygen  related to growth the cases of s. mutans, s. aureus. however, no growth effects were detected on e. coli cultures.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  == it is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and  mucosal infections. in this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. the following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and enterics. the study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. all were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 ml/min  (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 ml/min (stimulated). the control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. there was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. the presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was  comparable with that in the healthy controls. the results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  == a novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. a secreted protein, eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of s. aureus newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of s. aureus. eap  bound much less to cells of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, or  escherichia coli. the protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of s. aureus. binding of s. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.

TI  == staphylococcal enterotoxin b primes cytokine secretion and lytic activity in response to native bacterial antigens.
AB  == superantigens stimulate t-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, but the effects of superantigen exposure on cell function within a complex, highly regulated immune response remain to be determined. in this study, we demonstrate  that superantigen exposure significantly alters the murine host response to bacterial antigens in an in vitro coculture system. two days after exposure to the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin b, splenocytes cultured with streptococcus mutans produced significantly greater amounts of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and interleukin-12 than did sham-injected controls. the majority of ifn-gamma production appeared to be cd8(+) t-cell derived since depletion of this cell type dramatically reduced the levels of ifn-gamma. to study host cell damage that may occur following superantigen exposure, we analyzed cytotoxicity to "bystander" fibroblast cells cultured with splenocytes in the presence of bacterial antigens. prior host exposure to staphylococcal enterotoxin b significantly enhanced fibroblast cytotoxicity in the presence of bacteria. neutralization of ifn-gamma decreased the amount of cytotoxicity observed. however, a greater reduction was evident when splenocyte-bacterium cocultures were separated from the bystander cell monolayer via a permeable membrane support. increased cytotoxicity appears to be primarily dependent upon cell-cell  contact. collectively, these data indicate that overproduction of inflammatory cytokines may alter the activity of cytotoxic immune cells. superantigen exposure exacerbates cytokine production and lytic cell activity when immune cells encounter bacteria in vitro and comparable activities could possibly occur in vivo.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == [misunderstood symptoms in patients with infectious endocarditis].
AB  == infectious endocarditis was diagnosed in four patients, men aged 18, 44, 35 and 22; the bacteria involved were streptococcus viridans, eikenella corrodens, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans, respectively. in all patients mycotic aneurysms were observed which had led to seemingly unrelated neurological or abdominal complaints. in one patient an aneurysm of the a. cerebri media resolved in two years, another patient died following fatal bleeding of a ruptured aneurysm in the a. hepatica propria. mycotic aneurysms may be found in all parts of the body. this complication is often diagnosed too late because it is not considered.

TI  == synthetic histatin analogues with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  == histatins are salivary histidine-rich cationic peptides, ranging from 7 to 38 amino acid residues in length, that exert a potent killing effect in vitro on candida albicans. starting from the c-terminal fungicidal domain of histatin 5 (residues 11-24, called dh-5) a number of substitution analogues were chemically  synthesized to study the effect of amphipathicity of the peptide in helix conformation on candidacidal activity. single substitutions in dh-5 at several positions did not have any effect on fungicidal activity. however, multi-site substituted analogues (dhvar1 and dhvar2) exhibited a 6-fold increased activity over dh-5. in addition, dhvar1 and dhvar2 inhibited the growth of the second most common yeast found in clinical isolates, torulopsis glabrata, of oral- and non-oral pathogens such as prevotella intermedia and streptococcus mutans, and of a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in their broad-spectrum activity,  dhvar1 and dhvar2 were comparable to magainins (pgla and magainin 2), antimicrobial peptides of amphibian origin. both the fungicidal and the haemolytic activities of dhvar1, dhvar2 and magainins increased at decreasing ionic strength.

TI  == induction of nitric oxide production by polyosides from the cell walls of streptococcus mutans omz 175, a gram-positive bacterium, in the rat aorta.
AB  == the cardiovascular dysfunctions associated with septic shock induced by gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria (gram-positive or gram-negative septic shock) are comparable. in gram-negative septic shock, lipopolysaccharide (lps) induces nitric oxide (no) synthase, which contributes to the vascular hypotension and hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictors. the role of no in gram-positive septic shock and the nature of the bacterial wall components responsible for the vascular effects of gram-positive bacteria are not well known. this study investigated the vascular effects of cell wall serotype polyosides, rhamnose glucose polymers (rgps), from streptococcus mutans, in comparison with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from staphylococcus aureus, on the induction of no synthase activity in the rat aorta. we show that 10 microg of both rgps and lta per ml induced hyporeactivity to noradrenaline, l-arginine-induced relaxation, increases of 2.2- and 7.8-fold, respectively, of cyclic gmp production, and increases of 7- and 12-fold in nitrite release. all of these effects appeared after several hours of incubation and were inhibited by n(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name), an inhibitor of no synthase. electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping experiments demonstrated directly that rgps and lta induced no overproduction (four- to eightfold, respectively) in rat aortic rings; this production was inhibited by l-name and prevented by dexamethasone. these results demonstrate directly the induction of no production in vascular tissue by lta and show that another, chemically different component of gram-positive bacteria can also have these properties. this result suggests that different components of the gram-positive bacterial wall could be implicated in the genesis of cardiovascular dysfunctions observed in gram-positive septic shock.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == studies on the antimicrobial activity of juglans regia.
AB  == juglans regia l. bark is used in some countries as a toothbrush and as a dye for  coloring the lips for cosmetic purposes. its extract showed a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in a dose dependent manner. it inhibited the growth of several species of pathogenic micro-organisms representing gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans), gram-negative bacteria (esherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a pathogenic yeast (candida albicans). the extract has either synergistic or additive action when tested with a wide range of antibacterial drugs. it also increased the ph of saliva. thus, brushing the teeth with this bark may improve oral hygiene, prevent plaque and caries formation, and reduce the incidence of gingival and periodontal infections.

AB  == the efficacy of a newly-developed anti-cross-contamination device in dentistry, the air flushing clean system (afcs), was tested under experimental and clinical  conditions. in the experimental situation, a dental air turbine handpiece with or without afcs was contaminated with two bacterial strains, staphylococcus aureus fda209p and streptococcus mutants atcc25175. after contamination with these bacteria, the handpieces were subjected to two disinfecting methods. residual bacteria inside the handpiece or an air/water line were cultured and counted, and compared with controls. in this experiment, with afcs but no dental vacuum suction, wiping of the handpiece with 70% ethanol gauze reduced the count of s. aureus by 99%. no bacterial contamination in the air/water line was detected after exchanging with an autoclaved handpiece. with afcs and dental vacuum suction, bacterial contamination in the air/water line, as well as in the interior of the handpiece, was not detected. these results indicate that afcs could reduce bacterial contamination within the air turbine handpiece more effectively than the conventional handpiece regardless of whether or not the dental vacuum suction was used.

TI  == the effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. the antibacterial properties of the above were tested on streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus salivarius, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, staphylococcus aureus. this was followed by investigating its  effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca  nut. extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw  nut. growth of c. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. no antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. it is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in  the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the  nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.

TI  == antimicrobial abilities of various dentine bonding agents and restorative materials.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to observe and measure the in vitro effect of various composite restorative materials and dentine bonding agents on the growth and adherence of oral bacterial believed to be responsible for recurrent caries in humans and on micro-organisms commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting agents. methods: five sets of dentine bonding agents and composite resins and ten species of micro-organisms were used. circular disc specimens of each composite set were placed onto inoculated plates. zones of growth inhibition around specimens were measured after incubation. on other plates, specimens were placed alone for 48 h, removed, and then the micro-organisms added. also, the composite sets were placed into sterilized bovine incisors and suspended into sucrose-containing both inoculated with streptococcus mutans for 3 days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. results and conclusions: four of the composites sets produced statistically similar (p > 0.05) inhibitory zones. the gram-negative rods and the staphylococcus aureus were the most resistant micro-organisms. the five composites sets produced the same (p > 0.05) reduction in bacterial accumulation  (> 60%). aging of the specimens in water for periods up to 4 weeks prior to exposure to s. mutans did not affect product activity.

AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == role of the c terminus in antigen p1 surface localization in streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  == the c terminus of the major surface protein p1 from streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an lpntgv motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. these features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. to investigate the role of the c-terminal domains  in antigen p1 surface localization, full-length and truncated p1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pdl276, were transformed into the p1-negative mutant s. mutans sm3352, streptococcus gordonii dl-1, and enterococcus faecalis uv202. transformants were tested for expression of p1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and western blotting. the results showed that full-length p1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was  localized on the cell surface. a fusion protein composed of the staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein c terminus and the p1 protein n terminus was found to surface localize in s. mutans. deletion of the entire c-terminal domains resulted in p1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. a p1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its c terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. this truncated p1 was readily removed from the  isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. in contrast, the full-length p1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length p1  and the cell wall. the results described above showed that antigen p1 was anchored to the cell wall by its c-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. the results also support a universal mechanism involving the c-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == antibacterial activity of crinitol and its potentiation.
AB  == an acyclic diterpene alcohol, crinitol [1], was identified in a marine brown alga, sargassum tortile, as the principal antibacterial agent against gram-positive bacteria, among which propionibacterium acnes was most sensitive and, staphylococcus aureus was least. to enhance its activity, crinitol was combined with several antioxidants, which presumably retard oxidative destruction of this molecule which possesses two easily oxidizable allylic alcohol groups. two synthetic antioxidants, bha (butylated hydroxyanisole) and bht (butylated hydroxytoluene), significantly enhanced the activity of crinitol, especially against streptococcus mutans. interestingly, crinitol also synergized bht and bha against this cariogenic bacterium.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance (tet) gene and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pste1 from staphylococcus hyicus, was determined. the tet gene was inducible by tetracycline and encoded a hydrophobic  protein of 458 amino acids. comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of the pste1-encoded tet from s. hyicus and the previously sequenced tet k variants from staphylococcus aureus, tet l variants from bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, and bacillus subtilis, tet m variants from streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus as well as tet o from streptococcus mutans were performed. an alignment of tet amino acid sequences revealed the presence of 30 conserved amino acids among these tet variants. on the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. it demonstrated  large evolutionary distances between the tet m and tet o variants on one hand and the tet k and tet l variants on the other hand. the pste1-encoded tet proved to be closely related to the tet l proteins originally found on small bacillus plasmids. the observed extensive similarities in the nucleotide sequences of the  tet genes and in the deduced tet amino acid sequences allowed the assignment of the pste1-encoded tet to the tet proteins of class l.

TI  == in-vitro bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by oral streptococci against human carrier strains of staphylococci.
AB  == all strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of streptococcus mutans, strep. sanguis and strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (p less than 0.001, chi 2 test and p less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. the sensitivity of nasal  over oral staph. aureus (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01) and of oral staph. epidermidis over oral staph. aureus (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. the evaluation of variability of inhibitory  patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.

TI  == carriage of oral flora on irreversible hydrocolloid and elastomeric impression materials.
AB  == this study assessed the carriage and persistence of oral flora on irreversible hydrocolloid and elastomeric impression materials. in the first part of the study, a single isolate each of streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans were inoculated onto each of two elastomeric and two irreversible hydrocolloid impression surfaces artificially created in vitro. then the inoculum was discarded, samples of impression material (13 mm in diameter) were removed over a 5-hour period, and the remainder of viable organisms were estimated. in the second part of the study, impressions were made from 21 dentate and eight edentulous patients, and bacterial counts were estimated as described. the results showed twofold to fivefold retention of  bacteria on the irreversible hydrocolloids compared with the elastomeric impression surfaces. with all impression materials, the number of viable bacteria retained within 5 hours decreased 65% to 98% except for the "disinfectant" irreversible hydrocolloid blueprint asept, which totally destroyed the organisms  in less than 3 minutes. it is concluded that the total bacterial "load" on impression surfaces is relatively low and decreases rapidly after impression making. however, disinfection of impression surfaces should be mandatory to prevent cross-infection.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of an endodontic sealer can be helpful in destroying any remaining root canal microbes. therefore it was decided to test the antimicrobial activity of several commonly used endodontic sealers. the sealers used were grossman's sealer, tubliseal, calciobiotic, sealapex, hypocal, eucapercha, nogenol, and ah26. also tested were dry calcium hydroxide powder, calcium hydroxide mixed with saline, and a teflon formulation. the microbes used  were streptococcus mutans (a gram-positive microaerophile). staphylococcus aureus (a gram-positive facultative anaerobe), and bacteroides endodontalis (a gram-negative obligate anaerobe). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the  prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation, the zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed and measured. grossman's sealer had the greatest overall antibacterial activity. however, ah26 had the greatest activity against b. endodontalis. the zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealers had more antimicrobial activity than either the  calcium hydroxide-based sealers or eucapercha.

TI  == bacterial adherence and contamination during radiographic processing.
AB  == oral fluids are potential contaminants of radiographic processors. this investigation measured bacterial contamination in a radiographic processing room  during times of high and low clinical activity and processing effects on five types of microorganisms. cultures in the clinical setting, during high and low activity, were taken by brain-heart infusion agar plates placed near automatic processors. site samples were taken of entrance, developer, fixer, water, and exit surfaces. measurements of processing effects were accomplished by intentional contamination of films run in series through an automatic processor.  site samples were again taken of the processor. in the clinical setting colony-forming units increased with activity. radiographic processing after intentional contamination decreased colony-forming units on films, but they increased for all processing solutions. bacteria on radiographic film survived processing. although processing procedures significantly reduce the number of bacteria on films, the potential for contamination and cross-contamination remains.

AB  == we show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called iiiman. this protein was purified from streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on deae-cellulose, deae-tsk, hydroxyapatite, and dyematrex green a. the purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. however, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of s. salivarius of 2 different forms of iiiman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. the presence of the high-molecular-weight form of iiiman was observed by immunodiffusion, western blot and phosphorylation by [32]pep in s. salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus lactis but not in streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei. antibodies directed against the iiiman of s. salivarius  did not react with the iiiman of escherichia coli.

AB  == the penetration by bacteria through dentinal tubules was studied using a device that included portion of bovine anterior teeth. strains of 4 genera, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli, were used for the experiment, and the effects of acid etching of dentin on  the penetration of bacteria through the dentin was examined. the time required for penetration through dentinal tubules of acid-etched samples was shorter than  that of unetched samples. the minimum time required for half the samples to become positive for bacterial penetration through dentin mpt50 was 4 hours for all strains chosen when the acid-etched dentin was the target. in non-acid etched samples, the mpt50 varied among the genera and ranged from 20 hours to 48 hours;  the speed of penetration was sta. aureus = l. casei greater than str. mutans greater than e. coli. observation under the scanning electron microscope indicated that the smeared layer was completely coated on the surface of the prepared cavity, and when bacterial penetration occurred, a portion of the smear  layer on the dentin disappeared. in longitudinal sections, the penetration by the bacteria into the tubules was visible. from these results, it is suggested that the smeared layer have an important effects on bacterial penetration through these tubules.

AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of streptococcus mutans: purification of hpr and enzyme i and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == lactose transport in streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor iiilac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == resolution of the phosphotransferase enzymes of streptococcus mutans: purification and preliminary characterization of a heat-stable phosphocarrier protein.
AB  == the sucrose phosphotransferase system of streptococcus mutans catalyzes the phosphorylation of sucrose to sucrose-6-phosphate with concomitant translocation  of this disaccharide across the cytoplasmic membrane in reactions requiring intracellular phosphoenolpyruvate. soluble proteins released by vigorous homogenization of cells with glass beads are shown to be necessary for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of sucrose in combination with one  or more proteins that remain tightly associated with the membrane fraction. we have partially purified phosphotransferase enzyme i and have purified a heat-stable phosphocarrier protein (hpr) to apparent homogeneity, by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography from the soluble fraction. hpr from s. mutans has an apparent molecular weight larger than that of escherichia coli hpr  but has properties similar to those of staphylococcus aureus hpr. furthermore, it appears to be partially complexed with a heat-stable enzyme iii-like protein in cell-free fractions from s. mutans, and we also report the purification of this complex. enzyme i from s. mutans is a protein (native mr greater than 100,000) that cross-complements enzyme i from s. aureus. preliminary characterizations of  homogeneous hpr and its complex with the putative enzyme iii are also presented.

TI  == ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  == the present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (pfn). avid binding of 125i-pfn was found for streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), streptococcus sanguis, group a streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible pfn binding ability. two gram-negative bacterial species, bacteroides gingivalis and escherichia coli, did not significantly bind pfn. 125i-pfn binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled pfn, and the radiolabeled pfn bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled pfn. strong inhibition of 125i-pfn  binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. these results suggest that pfn  binding to s. mutans cells is reversible and that pfn receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.

TI  == effect of dextranase and protease enzymes on aggregation of streptococcus mutans: colorimetric and electron microscopic studies.
AB  == sucrose-induced aggregation of streptococcus mutans was ascertained by measuring  the decrease in optical density of a cell suspension after 20 h incubation. the optimum sucrose concentration for the aggregation assay was 5% w/v, at an incubation temperature of 37 degrees c. dextranase and protease enzymes were added to the suspensions to determine their effects on aggregation. dextranase treatment decreased aggregation. electron microscopic studies revealed a reduction in the amount of a diffuse coat which surrounded cells in the absence of the enzyme but in the presence of sucrose, and a degradative effect on fibrous extracellular material. protease treatment of suspensions produced an increase in optical density; cell aggregates were not apparent. electron microscopic studies  revealed extensive cell damage and lysis. the success of these enzymes in decreasing aggregation would indicate a role in both caries and plaque control in vivo.

TI  == purification of proteins similar to hpr and enzyme i from the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius. biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) is made of several  proteins. two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the pts. these two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed hpr and enzyme i (ei). we reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.  hpr was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on ultrogel  aca44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. the protein contained no tryptophan and had a pi of 4.8. the purification scheme of ei was as follows: deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, deae-sephadex a-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on ultrogel aca34. the five-step purification for ei produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of hpr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees c. the fraction obtained after filtration on ultrogel aca34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. enzyme i had a pi of 4.2,  a ph optimum of 6.7, a km for hpr of about 27 microm, a km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mm, and kinetics that were consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. evidence had been obtained which indicated that s. salivarius enzyme i was antigenically very similar to enzyme i from various strains of streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli.

AB  == an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from  cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees  c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions  of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.

TI  == adp-like platelet aggregation activity generated by viridans streptococci incubated with exogenous atp.
AB  == to explore the possibility that streptococcus sanguis aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (prp) might be mediated by soluble agents, we tested cell-free s. sanguis supernatant for aggregation activity. the supernatant of untreated s. sanguis was without measurable prp aggregation activity. in contrast, the cell-free supernatant of atp-incubated s. sanguis produced an immediate wave of prp aggregation. the supernatant with prp aggregating activity  contained insufficient protease to produce a response. the response increased with the time of incubation with atp. active supernatant was desalted and chromatographed on nucleotide-calibrated columns of dowex 1-x8. an active adp function was identified. the activity was insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was sensitive to both ca2+ and ca2+-mg2+ chelating  agents, cold (4 degrees c), heat (80 degrees c), ph (optimum between ph 7 and 8), apyrase, and sodium molybdate. in addition, preincubation of prp with adenosine inhibited activity. strains of viridans streptococci were screened for activity.  aggregation-promoting strains showed two times more activity than did other strains. although it was not vigorously excluded that the adp was discharged from the microbes, the existence of an exogenous atpase on s. sanguis was strongly suggested. the expression of the activity was associated with the lag time to onset of prp aggregation with intact s. sanguis. this activity could, therefore,  be a synergistic promoter of prp aggregation and an additional virulence factor in endocarditis.

TI  == aggregation of human platelets and adhesion of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == platelet vegetations or thrombi are common findings in subacute bacterial endocarditis. we investigated the hypothesis that human platelets selectively bind or adhere strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans and aggregate, as a result, into an in vitro thrombus. earlier ultrastructural studies suggested that aggregation of platelets over time by staphylococcus aureus was preceded in order by adhesion and platelet activation. we uncoupled the adhesion step from activation and aggregation in our studies by incubating streptococci with platelet ghosts in a simple, quantitative assay. adhesion was shown to be mediated by protease-sensitive components on the streptococci and platelet ghosts rather than cell surface carbohydrates or dextrans, plasma components, or divalent cations. the same streptococci were also studied by standard aggregometry techniques. platelet-rich plasma was activated and aggregated by certain isolates of s. sanguis. platelet ghosts bound the same strains selectively under ca2+- and plasma-depleted conditions. fresh platelets could activate after washing, but ca2+ had to be restored. aggregation required fresh platelets in ca2+-restored plasma and was inducible by washed streptococcal cell walls. these reactions in the binding and aggregometry assays were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. surface microfibrils on intact s. sanguis were identified. these appendages appeared to bind s. sanguis to platelets. the selectivity of adhesion of the various s. sanguis strains to platelet ghosts or ca2+- and plasma-depleted fresh washed platelets was similar for all donors. thus, the platelet binding site was expressed widely in the population and was unlikely to be an artifact of membrane aging or preparation. since selective adhesion of s. sanguis to platelets was apparently required for aggregation, it is suggested that functionally defined receptors for ligands on certain strains of s. sanguis may be present on human platelets. some differences in the selectivity and rate of the aggregation response were noted among platelet donors, although the meaning of the variability requires further study. nonetheless, these interactions may contribute to platelet accretion in the initiation and development of vegetative lesions in the subacute bacterial endocarditis.

AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

AB  == the mechanisms for transport and hydrolysis of lactose were investigated in five  cariogenic strains (hs6, aht, fa1, nctc 10449, and sl1) representing the four serogenetic groups of streptococcus mutans. the systems for transport and hydrolysis of lactose had the characteristics of a phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent lactose (lac) phosphotransferase (pt) system and phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal), respectively, in all strains tested, except strain hs6. decryptified cells required pep and mg(2+) for transport of the non-metabolizable model beta-galactosides o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and thiomethyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (tmg). substitution of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-pg) for pep also stimulated the lac pt system. other potential high-energy phosphate donors (adenosine tri-, di-, and monophosphates and guanosine triphosphate) did not stimulate the lac pt system. sodium fluoride had no effect  upon the pep-dependent lac pt system in decryptified cells with pep as the energy source; however, when 2-pg was used as the energy source, f(-) inhibited onpg phosphorylation. with intact cells which must generate pep endogenously, the presence of f(-) in concentration >/= 10 mm completely inhibited the lac pt system, presumably through inhibition of 2-pg hydrolyase (ec 4.2.1.11; enolase).  both intact and decryptified cells accumulated a phosphorylated derivative of tmg that behaved chromatographically as tmg-phosphate. after alkaline phosphatase treatment, the derivative had an r(f) identical to that of tmg. no beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity was detected with onpg as the substrate; hydrolysis occurred only when onpg-6-phosphate was supplied as the substrate. strain hs6 apparently transported lactose by an active transport-type system in which the accumulated intracellular product was the free disaccharide based on the following criteria: (i) onpg transport and hydrolysis in decryptified cells was not stimulated by pep; (ii) onpg hydrolysis occurred in the absence of pep; and (iii) onpg-6-phosphate was not hydrolyzed. these data indicate that, in all strains tested except strain hs6, lactose transport was mediated by a pep-dependent lac pt system, resulting in accumulation of lactose-phosphate that  was hydrolyzed by an enzyme similar to the p-beta-gal of group n streptococci and staphylococcus aureus; conversely, strain hs6 transported and hydrolyzed lactose  by a pep-independent transport system and beta-gal, respectively.

AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

TI  == cation exchange in cell walls of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the relative affinities of various cations for anionic sites in isolated, bacterial cell walls were assessed by means of a technique involving displacement of one cation by another. the affinity series determined was h+ greater than la3+ greater than cd2+ greater than sr2+ greater than ca2+ greater than mg2+ greater than k+ greater than na+ greater than li+. high affinity was correlated with low  mobility of the bound ions in an electric field. the net cation-exchange capacities of walls isolated from a variety of bacteria were estimated by preparing the magnesium forms of the walls, washing them well with deionized water to remove supernumerary ions, and then completely displacing the magnesium  with na+ or h+. total amounts of magnesium displaced varied from 73 mumol per gram dry weight, for walls of the teichoic acid-deficient 52a5 strain of staphylococcus aureus to about 520 mumol per gram for bacillus megaterium km walls....

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

TI  == induction of adjuvant arthritis in the rat by various bacterial cell walls and their water-soluble components.
AB  == a number of purified cell walls of various gram-positive bacteria had arthritogenic activity in the rat. the water-soluble adjuvant-active component(s), which were isolated from some of these cell walls by utilizing a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, did produce severe adjuvant arthritis. however, the components obtained by digestion with glycan-degrading enzymes failed to produce arthritis. thus, the present finding indicates the importance of a peptidoglycan portion, especially its intact glycan chain, for induction of adjuvant arthritis.

TI  == production and properties of an extracellular bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans bacteriocidal for group a and other streptococci.
AB  == an extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. the  lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts  of a standardized suspension of group a streptococci in broth. no lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen  in electron micrographs. the material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups a, c, d, g, h, l, and o streptococci. it was inactive against strains of s. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, bacillus  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. it was sensitive to trysin and pronase and resistant to catalase. it possessed a  molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. the properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. group a streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as  did the sensitive cells. the bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 c.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == scanning electron microscopy of intact colonies of microorganisms.
AB  == colonies of s. mutans omz61, streptococcus sp. d182, staphylococcus aureus oxford nctc 6571, and candida albicans type a, mrl 3153 were grown on various media. cubes of agar bearing two to three colonies were excised and processed for scanning electron microscopy. the characteristic shape of the colonies was seen when examined at low magnifications. at a magnification of 2,000 diameters, the arrangement of individual organisms within the colonies was observed. plano-convex colonies consisted of uniformly distributed organisms, whereas s. mutans colonies presented a more complex arrangement possibly associated with the production of extracellular polysaccharides. certain colonies were totally or partially covered by an adherent film through which the outline of the organisms  could be distinguished.
