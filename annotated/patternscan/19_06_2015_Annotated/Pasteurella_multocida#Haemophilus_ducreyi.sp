TI  == pasteurella multocida cmp-sialic acid synthetase and mutants of neisseria meningitidis cmp-sialic acid synthetase with improved substrate promiscuity.
AB  == cytidine 5'-monophosphate (cmp)-sialic acid synthetases (csss) catalyze the formation of cmp-sialic acid from ctp and sialic acid, a key step for sialyltransferase-catalyzed biosynthesis of sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. more than 50 different sialic acid forms have been identified in nature. to facilitate the enzymatic synthesis of sialosides with diverse naturally occurring sialic acid forms and their non-natural derivatives, cmp-sialic acid synthetases with promiscuous substrate specificity are needed. herein we report the cloning, characterization, and substrate specificity studies of a new css from pasteurella multocida strain p-1059 (pmcss) and a css from haemophillus ducreyi (hdcss). based on protein sequence alignment and substrate specificity studies of these two csss and a neisseria meningitidis css (nmcss), as well as crystal structure modeling and analysis of nmcss, nmcss mutants (nmcss_s81r and nmcss_q163a) with improved substrate promiscuity were generated. the strategy of combining substrate specificity studies of enzymes from different sources and protein crystal structure studies can be a general approach for designing enzyme mutants with improved activity and substrate promiscuity.

TI  == new plasmid tools for genetic analysis of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  == we have generated a set of plasmids, based on the mobilizable shuttle vector pmidg100, which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other members of the pasteurellaceae. a tandem reporter plasmid, pmc-tandem, carrying promoterless xyle and gfpmut3 genes downstream of a multiple-cloning site (mcs), can be used for identification of transcriptional regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned promoters. the ability to detect transcriptional regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in a. pleuropneumoniae using the cloned rpoe (sigma(e)) promoter (p). the resulting plasmid, pmcrpoep, was used to identify a  mutant defective in production of rsea, the negative regulator of sigma(e), among a bank of random transposon mutants, as well as to detect induction of sigma(e) following exposure of a. pleuropneumoniae to ethanol or heat shock. pmcsodcp, carrying the cloned sodc promoter of a. pleuropneumoniae, was functional in a. pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parasuis, mannheimia haemolytica, and pasteurella multocida. two general expression vectors, pmk-express and pmc-express, which differ in their antibiotic resistance markers  (kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively), were constructed for the pasteurellaceae. both plasmids have the a. pleuropneumoniae sodc promoter upstream of the gfpmut3 gene and an extended mcs. replacement of gfpmut3 with a gene of interest allows complementation and heterologous gene expression, as evidenced by expression of the haemophilus ducreyi nadv gene in a. pleuropneumoniae, rendering the latter nad independent.

TI  == molecular phylogenetic analysis of tryptophanyl-trna synthetase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetase family enzymes are of particular interest for creating  universal phylogenetic trees and understanding the gene flow as these enzymes perform the basic and analogous biochemical function of protein synthesis in all  extant organisms. among them, tryptophanyl-trna synthetase (trp-rs) plays a foremost role in phylogeny owing to the close relationship with tyrosine-trna synthetase. in this study, the sequence of the gene trp-rs was amplified using degenerated adenylation domain primers in the periodontal bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the sequence of the cloned pcr amplicon confirmed the adenylation domain sequence with glutamic acid residue, which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the database. the trp-rs sequence analysis prevailed  the identify elements such as rossmann-fold sequence and trna(trp) binding domains including acceptor stem and anticodon. a theoretical model of trp-rs of a. actinomycetemcomitans was generated. guided docking of the ligand tryptophanyl-5'-amp revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial template. the phylogenetic positioning of trp-rs among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that a. actinomycetemcomitans is closely related  to haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == evolution of competence and dna uptake specificity in the pasteurellaceae.
AB  == background: many bacteria can take up dna, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. the sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (uss) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient dna uptake. we used the distribution of competence genes and dna uptake specificity in h. influenzae's family, the pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. results: a phylogeny of the pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the hin subclade (h. influenzae, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia succiniciproducens, and h. somnus), and the apl subclade (a. pleuropneumoniae, m. haemolytica, and h. ducreyi). all species contained homologues of all known h. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. competence gene defects were identified in three  species (h. somnus, h. ducreyi and m. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. the assumption that uss arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of h. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. abundant uss-like repeats were found in all eight pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the hin subclade were identical to that of h. influenzae (aagtgcggt), whereas members of the apl subclade shared the consensus  acaagcggt. all species' usss had the strong consensus and flanking at-rich repeats of h. influenzae usss. dna uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the apl-type repeat is a true uss distinct from the hin-type uss: a. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up dna fragments containing the apl-type uss over both h. influenzae and unrelated dnas, and h. influenzae prefers its own uss over the apl type. conclusion: competence and dna uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the pasteurellaceae, with divergent usss  and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. the conservation of most competence genes over the approximately 350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends.

TI  == therapy of other bacterial infections.
AB  == cutaneous bacterial disease continues to account for a significant proportion of  clinical visits. the continuing emergence of strains that are resistant to available antibacterial agents creates a challenge for dermatologists, who need to keep abreast of current treatment strategies. in this article, antibacterial regimens are presented for skin infections caused by organisms such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, pseudomonas, neisseria, haemophilus ducreyi, treponema pallidum, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, vibrio vulnificus, actinomyces, and nocardia.

TI  == cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we have identified an 85-kda outer membrane protein that is expressed by all tested strains of haemophilus ducreyi. studies of related proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella multocida, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and shigella dysenteriae, suggested a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. in keeping with the first such described protein from haemophilus influenzae type b, we termed the h. ducreyi protein d15. the gene encoding the h. ducreyi d15 protein was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be most similar to sequences of the d15-related proteins from other pasteurella spp. the  arrangement of the flanking genes was similar to that of h. influenzae rd and suggested that d15 was part of a multigene operon. attempts to make a null mutation of the d15 gene were unsuccessful, paralleling results in other d15 gene studies. overexpression of h. ducreyi d15 in escherichia coli resulted in a source of recombinant d15 (rd15) from which it was readily purified. rd15 was immunogenic, and it was found that immunization of rabbits with an rd15 vaccine preparation conferred partial protection against a virulent challenge infection.  antisera to an n-terminal peptide recognized all tested strains of h. ducreyi.

TI  == identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from haemophilus ducreyi which confers nad independence.
AB  == members of the family pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an nad supplement for growth on laboratory media. in this study, we  demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadv, whose presence allows nad-independent growth of haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. this gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for nad independence in haemophilus ducreyi. when transformed into a. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed nad-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of nad on defined media. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular  mass of 55,619 da. compared with the sequence databases, nadv was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor pbef and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, shewanella putrefaciens, synechocystis sp., deinococcus radiodurans, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. p. multocida and a. actinomycetemcomitans are among the nad-independent members of the pasteurellaceae. homologues of nadv  were not found in the sequenced genome of h. influenzae, an nad-dependent member  of the pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of nad, such as escherichia coli. sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. identification of a function for this gene in the pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.

TI  == bacterial [cu,zn]-superoxide dismutase: phylogenetically distinct from the eukaryotic enzyme, and not so rare after all!
AB  == copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutases ([cu,zn]-sods) are generally considered almost exclusively eukaryotic enzymes, protecting the cytosol and extracellular compartments of higher organisms from damage by oxygen free-radicals. the recent description of a few examples of bacterial forms of the enzyme, located in the periplasm of different gram-negative micro-organisms, prompted a re-evaluation of this general perception. a pcr-based approach has been developed and used successfully to identify bacterial genes encoding [cu,zn]-sod in a wide range of important human and animal pathogens-members of the haemophilus, actinobacillus and pasteurella (hap) group, and neisseria meningitidis. comparison of [cu,zn]-sod peptide sequences found in haemophilus ducreyi, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pasteurella multocida, and n. meningitidis with previously described bacterial proteins and examples of eukaryotic [cu,zn]-sod has shown that the bacterial proteins constitute a distinct family apparently widely separated in evolutionary terms from the eukaryotic examples. the widespread occurrence of [cu,zn]-sod in the periplasm of bacterial pathogens, appropriately located to dismute exogenously derived superoxide radical anions, suggests that this enzyme may play a role in the interactive biology of organisms with their hosts and so contribute to their capacity to cause disease.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
