TI  == comparison of phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the objective of this work is to compare the phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis. the bacterial examination of 50 livers of individual broilers, marketed by four major outlets,  revealed a high recovery of p. mirabilis (66%), and a low recovery frequency of salmonella spp. (4%), serratia odorifera (2%), citrobacter brakii (2%), and providencia stuartii (2%). the phenotypic biochemical characterization of the recovered 33 chicken isolates of p. mirabilis were compared to 30 human isolates  (23 urinary and six respiratory isolates). the comparison revealed significant differences in the presence of gelatinase enzyme (100% presence in chicken isolates versus 91.3 and 83.3% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the h(2)s production occurred in 100% of chicken isolates versus 95.6 and 66.7% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the other 17 biochemical characteristics did not differ significantly among the three groups of isolates (p.0.05). two virulence genes, the mrpa and flil, were having a typical 100% presence in randomly selected isolates of p. mirabilis recovered from chicken livers (n510) versus isolates recovered from urinary (n55) and respiratory specimens of humans (n55) (p.0.05). the average percentage similarity of mrpa gene nucleotide sequence of poultry isolates to human urinary and respiratory isolates was 93.2 and 97.5-%, respectively. the high similarity in phenotypic characteristics, associated with  typical frequency of presence of two virulence genes, and high similarity in sequences of mrpa gene among poultry versus human p. mirabilis isolates justifies future investigations targeting the evaluation of adaptable pathogenicity of avian proteus mirabilis isolates to mammalian hosts.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
