TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  == background: polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. the evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. in particular, 16s rdna-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. case presentation: a 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection  and osteomyelitis. the chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. culture  and dhplc revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. the analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, and fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely gemella morbillorum, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides fragilis, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. conclusions: this clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. the diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. however, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between april 2008 and march 2009].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2008 to march 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis was  the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections,  b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  wadsworthia and b. ovatus, in this order. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and enterococcus spp., nor  multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == [two cases of gram-positive sepsis successfully treated with vancomycin in combination with imipenem or cilastatin].
AB  == against gram-positive sepsis, vancomycin (vcm) was administered in combination with imipenem or cilastatin (ipm/cs). its excellent efficacy was confirmed in 2 cases, one affected with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and another  with gemella morbillorum. by calculating the fic index according to a checkerboard technique, the in vitro synergistic effect was also demonstrated. at the present state multi-drug resistant gram-positive infections prevailed, the combination of vcm with ipm/cs can be expected as an effective measure for treating these diseases.

TI  == [pericarditis caused by gemella morbillorum. description of a case].
AB  == pericardial diseases, in the pediatric age group are rare, and are usually due to viral infection or collagen diseases. since the advent of the antibiotic era, bacterial pericardial has rarely been reported, and the bacteria most commonly involved are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophylus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis; other pyogenic agents have rarely been isolated in pericarditis. gemella morbillorum, also known as streptococcus morbillorum, is a gram-positive pyogen, usually a saprophite agent of the human gastrointestinal tract, rarely associated with human infections such as arthritis, endocarditis and meningitidis; to our knowledge, it has never been isolated in pericarditis. we report a case of pyogenic pericarditis in an 11-year-old boy, suffering from substernal chest pain for about one year, in which the clinical symptoms, the presence of acute phase proteins, the large amount of fluid within the pericardial space (echocardiographically estimated to  be approximately 18 mm), the lack of improvement in clinical conditions and in laboratory values after therapy (diuretics, broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids) led to the indication for a pericardial drainage with the isolation of  gemella morbillorum. antimicrobial therapy was then modified according to in vitro susceptibility of the gemella morbillorum, with a decisive contribution to  the recovery of the patient, although long-term steroid therapy (5 months) was necessary because of one recurrence of pericardial effusion. this case report shows how gemella morbillorum, usually a saprophit microorganism, can become pathogenic and also underlines the importance of a correct etiologic diagnosis of pericarditis resistent to classical antibiotic therapy.
