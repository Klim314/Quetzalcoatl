TI  == faecalicoccus acidiformans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the chicken caecum, and reclassification of streptococcus pleomorphus (barnes et al. 1977), eubacterium biforme (eggerth 1935) and eubacterium cylindroides (cato et al. 1974) as faecalicoccus pleomorphus comb. nov., holdemanella biformis gen. nov., comb. nov. and faecalitalea cylindroides gen. nov., comb. nov., respectively, within the family erysipelotrichaceae.
AB  == strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427 were isolated from the caecal content of a chicken and produced butyric, lactic and formic acids as major metabolic end products. the genomic dna g+c contents of strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427 were 40.4 and 38.8 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, both strains were most closely related to the generically misclassified streptococcus  pleomorphus atcc 29734(t). strain lmg 27428(t) could be distinguished from s. pleomorphus atcc 29734(t) based on production of more lactic acid and less formic acid in m2gsc medium, a higher dna g+c content and the absence of activities of acid phosphatase and leucine, arginine, leucyl glycine, pyroglutamic acid, glycine and histidine arylamidases, while strain lmg 27428 was biochemically indistinguishable from s. pleomorphus atcc 29734(t). the novel genus faecalicoccus gen. nov. within the family erysipelotrichaceae is proposed to accommodate strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427. strain lmg 27428(t) ( =dsm 26963(t)) is the type strain of faecalicoccus acidiformans sp. nov., and strain lmg 27427 ( =dsm 26962) is a strain of faecalicoccus pleomorphus comb. nov. (type strain lmg 17756(t) =atcc 29734(t) =dsm 20574(t)). furthermore, the nearest phylogenetic neighbours of the genus faecalicoccus are the generically misclassified eubacterium cylindroides dsm 3983(t) (94.4% 16s rrna gene sequence  similarity to strain lmg 27428(t)) and eubacterium biforme dsm 3989(t) (92.7% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to strain lmg 27428(t)). we present genotypic and phenotypic data that allow the differentiation of each of these taxa and propose  to reclassify these generically misnamed species of the genus eubacterium formally as faecalitalea cylindroides gen. nov., comb. nov. and holdemanella biformis gen. nov., comb. nov., respectively. the type strain of faecalitalea cylindroides is dsm 3983(t) =atcc 27803(t) =jcm 10261(t) and that of holdemanella biformis is dsm 3989(t) =atcc 27806(t) =ccug 28091(t).

TI  == quantification of different eubacterium spp. in human fecal samples with species-specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == species-specific 16s rrna-targeted, cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed and validated to quantify different eubacterium species in human fecal samples. probes were directed at eubacterium barkeri, e. biforme, e. contortum, e. cylindroides (two probes), e. dolichum, e.  hadrum, e. lentum, e. limosum, e. moniliforme, and e. ventriosum. the specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. with one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. the species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. e. biforme, e. cylindroides, e. hadrum, e. lentum, and e. ventriosum could be determined. all other eubacterium species for  which probes had been designed were under the detection limit of 10(7) cells g (dry weight) of feces(-1). the cell counts obtained are essentially in accordance with the literature data, which are based on colony counts. this shows that whole-cell in situ hybridization with species-specific probes is a valuable tool  for the enumeration of eubacterium species in feces.
