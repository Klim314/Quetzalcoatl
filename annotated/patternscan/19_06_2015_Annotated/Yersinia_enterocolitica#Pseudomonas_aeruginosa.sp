TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
AB  == propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and  the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.

TI  == expanding the results of a high throughput screen against an isochorismate-pyruvate lyase to enzymes of a similar scaffold or mechanism.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern, and new avenues of antimicrobial drug design are being actively sought. one suggested pathway to be  targeted for inhibitor design is that of iron scavenging through siderophores. here we present a high throughput screen to the isochorismate-pyruvate lyase of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an enzyme required for the production of the siderophore  pyochelin. compounds identified in the screen are high nanomolar to low micromolar inhibitors of the enzyme and produce growth inhibition in pao1 p. aeruginosa in the millimolar range under iron-limiting conditions. the identified compounds were also tested for enzymatic inhibition of escherichia coli chorismate mutase, a protein of similar fold and similar chemistry, and of yersinia enterocolitica salicylate synthase, a protein of differing fold but catalyzing the same lyase reaction. in both cases, subsets of the inhibitors from the screen were found to be inhibitory to enzymatic activity (mutase or synthase) in the micromolar range and capable of growth inhibition in their respective organisms (e. coli or y. enterocolitica).

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  == most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. the list of targets include, among the others, listeria spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., escherichia coli spp., campylobacter spp., clostridium spp. and staphylococcus aureus. the accuracy of detection was determined by using atcc strains as positive and negative controls. the achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic dna, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. the working ranges of the taqman((r)) real-time pcr assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of listeria spp., listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, salmonella enterica, shigella boydii, e. coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter sakazakii and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. no matrix interferences were observed.

TI  == green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  == this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated  by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == lysine221 is the general base residue of the isochorismate synthase from pseudomonas aeruginosa (pcha) in a reaction that is diffusion limited.
AB  == the isochorismate synthase from pseudomonas aeruginosa (pcha) catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate, which is subsequently converted by a second enzyme (pchb) to salicylate for incorporation into the salicylate-capped siderophore pyochelin. pcha is a member of the mst family of enzymes, which includes the structurally homologous isochorismate synthases from escherichia coli (entc and menf) and salicylate synthases from yersinia enterocolitica (irp9) and mycobacterium tuberculosis (mbti). the latter enzymes generate isochorismate  as an intermediate before generating salicylate and pyruvate. general acid-general base catalysis has been proposed for isochorismate synthesis in all  five enzymes, but the residues required for the isomerization are a matter of debate, with both lysine221 and glutamate313 proposed as the general base (pcha numbering). this work includes a classical characterization of pcha with steady state kinetic analysis, solvent kinetic isotope effect analysis and by measuring  the effect of viscosogens on catalysis. the results suggest that isochorismate production from chorismate by the mst enzymes is the result of general acid-general base catalysis with a lysine as the base and a glutamic acid as the  acid, in reverse protonation states. chemistry is determined to not be rate limiting, favoring the hypothesis of a conformational or binding step as the slow step.

TI  == biosynthesis of udp-glcnac, undpp-glcnac and udp-glcnaca involves three easily distinguished 4-epimerase enzymes, gne, gnu and gnab.
AB  == we have undertaken an extensive survey of a group of epimerases originally named  gne, that were thought to be responsible for inter-conversion of udp-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac) and udp-n-acetylgalactosamine (udp-galnac).  the analysis builds on recent work clarifying the specificity of some of these epimerases. we find three well defined clades responsible for inter-conversion of the gluco- and galacto-configuration at c4 of different n-acetylhexosamines. their major biological roles are the formation of udp-galnac, udp-n-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid (udp-galnaca) and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-n-acetylgalactosamine (undpp-galnac) from the corresponding glucose forms. we propose that the clade of udp-glcnaca epimerase genes be named gnab and the clade of undpp-glcnac epimerase genes be named gnu, while the udp-glcnac epimerase genes retain the name gne. the gne epimerases, as now defined after exclusion of those to be named gnab or gnu, are in the same clade as the gale 4-epimerases for inter-conversion of udp-glucose (udp-glc) and udp-galactose (udp-gal). this work brings clarity to an area that had become quite confusing. the identification of distinct enzymes for epimerisation of udp-glcnac, udp-glcnaca and undpp-glcnac will greatly facilitate allocation of gene function  in polysaccharide gene clusters, including those found in bacterial genome sequences. a table of the accession numbers for the 295 proteins used in the analysis is provided to enable the major tree to be regenerated with the inclusion of additional proteins of interest. this and other suggestions for annotation of 4-epimerase genes will facilitate annotation.

TI  == synergistic effect between colistin and bacteriocins in controlling gram-negative pathogens and their potential to reduce antibiotic toxicity in mammalian epithelial cells.
AB  == pathogens resistant to most conventional antibiotics are a harbinger of the need  to discover novel antimicrobials and anti-infective agents and develop innovative strategies to combat them. the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of colistin alone or in combination with two bacteriocins, nisin a and pediocin pa-1/ach, against salmonella choleraesuis atcc 14028, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, yersinia enterocolitica atcc 9610, and escherichia coli atcc 35150 (o157:h7). the strain most sensitive to colistin was enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7, which was inhibited at a concentration of about 0.12 mug/ml. when nisin a (1.70 mug/ml) or pediocin pa-1/ach (1.56 mug/ml) was combined with colistin, the concentrations required to inhibit e. coli o157:h7 were 0.01 and 0.03 mug/ml, respectively. the in vitro antigenotoxic effect of colistin was determined by using the comet assay method to measure the level of dna damage in  freshly isolated human peripheral blood leukocytes (pbls) incubated with colistin for 1 h at 37 degrees c. changes in the tail extents of pbls of about 69.29 +/- 0.08 mum were observed at a final colistin concentration of about 550 ng/ml. besides the synergistic effect, the combination of colistin (1 mg/ml) and nisin (2 mg/ml) permitted us to re-evaluate the toxic effect of colistin on vero (monkey kidney epithelial) cells.

TI  == rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  == aims: to evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. methods and results: using greenlight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes,  salmonella typhimurium and listeria innocua) were analysed. for each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. conclusion: the microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. significance and impact of the study: the new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.

TI  == two structures of a thiazolinyl imine reductase from yersinia enterocolitica provide insight into catalysis and binding to the nonribosomal peptide synthetase module of hmwp1.
AB  == the thiazolinyl imine reductase from yersinia enterocolitica (irp3) catalyzes the nadph-dependent reduction of a thiazoline ring in an intermediate for the formation of the siderophore yersiniabactin. two structures of irp3 were determined in the apo (1.85 a) and nadp(+)-bound (2.31 a) forms. irp3 is structurally homologous to sugar oxidoreductases such as glucose-fructose oxidoreductase and 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose reductase, as well as to biliverdin reductase. a homology model of the thiazolinyl imine reductase from pseudomonas aeruginosa (pchg) was generated. extensive loop insertions are observed in the c-terminal domain that are unique to irp3 and pchg and not found in the structural homologues that recognize small molecular substrates. these loops are  hypothesized to be important for binding of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules (found in hmwp1 and pchf, respectively) to which the substrate of the reductase is covalently attached. a catalytic mechanism for the donation of a proton from a general acid (either histidine 101 or tyrosine 128) and the donation of a hydride from c4 of nicotinamide of the nadph cofactor is proposed for reduction of the carbon-nitrogen double bond of the thiazoline.

TI  == emergence and stability of high-pressure resistance in different food-borne pathogens.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) processing is becoming a valuable nonthermal food pasteurization technique, although there is reasonable concern that bacterial hhp resistance could compromise the safety and stability of hhp-processed foods. while the degree of natural hhp resistance has already been shown to vary greatly among and within bacterial species, a still unresolved question remains as to what extent different food-borne pathogens can actually develop hhp resistance. in this study, we therefore examined and compared the intrinsic potentials for hhp resistance development among strains of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri,  salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria innocua using a selective enrichment approach. interestingly, of all strains examined, the acquisition of extreme hhp resistance could be detected in only some of the e. coli strains, indicating that a specific genetic predisposition might be required for resistance development. furthermore, once acquired, hhp resistance proved to be a very stable trait that was maintained for >80 generations in the absence of hhp exposure. finally, at the mechanistic level, hhp resistance was not necessarily linked to derepression of the heat shock genes and was not related to the phenomenon of persistence.

TI  == label-free detection of a bacterial pathogen using an immobilized siderophore, deferoxamine.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria obtain the iron necessary for survival by releasing an iron chelator, termed a siderophore, and retrieving the iron-siderophore complex via a cell surface siderophore receptor. we have exploited the high affinity of yersinia enterocolitica for its siderophore, deferoxamine, to develop a rapid method for capture and identification of yersinia. in this methodology, a deferoxamine-bovine serum albumin conjugate is printed onto a gold-plated chip in a parallel line pattern. after flowing a suspension of yersinia across the siderophore-derivatized chip, any yersinia that binds to the chip is detected by  dark-field microscopy analysis of the scattered light, followed by fourier transform analysis of the scattering pattern. since peak intensities are found to correlate with pathogen concentration, pathogen titers as low as 10(3) cfu/ml can be readily detected. moreover, immobilized deferoxamine can distinguish y. enterocolitica, which binds ferrioxamine (deferoxamine-fe), from staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which don't. because  human pathogens cannot easily mutate their iron retrieval systems without loss of viability, we suggest that few if any mutant yersinia will emerge that can avoid  detection. together with previous results demonstrating selective capture of pseudomonas aeruginosa by its immobilized siderophore (pyoverdin), these data suggest that pathogen-specific siderophores may constitute effective and immutable capture ligands for rapid detection and identification of their cognate pathogens.

TI  == effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  == marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. there is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. but problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes amphiprion sebae and a. ocellaris were  identified as aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sp., e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp., streptococcus sp., vibrio cholerae, v. alginolyticus, v. parahaemolyticus and yersinia enterocolitica. ethanol and methanol extracts were  highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. the present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.

TI  == structure of the metal-dependent deacetylase lpxc from yersinia enterocolitica complexed with the potent inhibitor chir-090 .
AB  == the first committed step of lipid a biosynthesis is catalyzed by udp-(3-o-((r)-3-hydroxymyristoyl))-n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, a metal-dependent deacetylase also known as lpxc. because lipid a is essential for  bacterial viability, the inhibition of lpxc is an appealing therapeutic strategy  for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. here we report the 1.79  a resolution x-ray crystal structure of lpxc from yersinia enterocolitica (yelpxc) complexed with the potent hydroxamate inhibitor chir-090. this enzyme is a nearly identical orthologue of lpxc from yersinia pestis (99.7% sequence identity), the pathogen that causes bubonic plague. similar to the inhibition of  lpxc from escherichia coli, chir-090 inhibits yelpxc via a two-step slow, tight-binding mechanism with an apparent k(i) of 0.54 +/- 0.14 nm followed by conversion of the e.i to e.i* species with a rate constant of 0.11 +/- 0.01 min(-1). the structure of the lpxc complex with chir-090 shows that the inhibitor hydroxamate group chelates the active site zinc ion, and the "tail" of the inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic tunnel in the active site. this hydrophobic tunnel is framed by a betaalphabeta subdomain that exhibits significant conformational flexibility as it accommodates inhibitor binding. chir-090 displays a 27 mm zone of inhibition against y. enterocolitica in a kirby-bauer antibiotic assay, which is comparable to its reported activity against other gram-negative species including e. coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study demonstrates that the inhibition of lpxc should be explored as a potential therapeutic and/or prophylatic response to infection by weaponized yersinia species.

AB  == background: the six organic solvent extracts of artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. methods: the agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of a. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. the phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in a. nilagirica. results: all the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. the hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low mic of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhi, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). the phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol,  quinines, tannins and terpenoids. conclusion: all the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. the results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the a. nilagirica extracts. hence, the isolation and purification  of therapeutic potential compounds from a. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.

TI  == bacterial toxins induce sustained mrna expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of rhoa and rhophilin 1.
AB  == yersiniae bearing the yersinia virulence plasmid pyv impact the transcriptome of  j774a.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a yersinia outer protein p (yopp)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mrna induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. here we show that klf2 induction by yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. several strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. screening of mutant strains or  incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins yopt from yersinia spp., exos from pseudomonas aeruginosa, edin-b from staphylococcus  aureus, and c3bot from clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mrna.  klf2 mrna induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. instead, short hairpin rna-mediated inactivation of rhoa and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. thus, bacteria exploit the rhoa-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.

TI  == bacterial contamination of blood and blood components in three major blood transfusion centers, accra, ghana.
AB  == reports from studies conducted in several countries indicate a high incidence of  bacterial contamination of donor blood. the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products in ghana is not known. this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products at  the three major blood transfusion centers in the greater accra region of ghana. stored whole blood and its products were cultured on different media, and isolates were identified using standard biochemical and bacteriological methods.  the susceptibility of the isolates to selected antimicrobial agents was also determined by the disc diffusion method. the overall prevalence rate was 9% (28/303; whole blood, 13% [24/192]; plasma, 3% [2/79]; platelet, 9% [2/22]). the  gram-positive bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococcus, s. aureus, and bacillus spp., and the gram-negative organisms were yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cloxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin but resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole, while the gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime (except y. enterocolitica), and cotrimoxazole. our results suggest that bacterial contamination of blood and its products is prevalent in ghana.

TI  == cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
AB  == use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus  (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli,  irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against  multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of  lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.

TI  == pleiotropic effect of tatc mutation on metabolism of pathogen yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == objective: to analyze the impact of depletion of the twin arginine translocation  (tat) system on virulence and physiology of yersinia enterocolitica for a better  understanding of its pathogenicity. methods: we constructed a deltatatc::spr mutant of yersinia enterocolitica by p1 phage mediated transduction using escherichia coli k-12 deltatatc::spr strain as a donor. results: a p1-mediated genetic material transfer was found between the two species of enterobacteria, indicating a great potential of acquisition of antibiotic resistance in emergency of a new threatening pathogen by genetic material exchanges. periplasmic trimethylamine n-oxidase reductase activity was detected in the wild type y. enterocolitica strain and translocation of this enzyme was completely abolished by the deltatatc::spr mutation. in addition, the deltatatc::spr mutation showed a pleiotropic effect on the metabolism of y. enterocolitica. however, the tat mutation did not seem to affect the mobility and virulence of y. enterocolitica under the conditions used. conclusion: unlike other pathogenic bacteria studied,  the tat system of y. enterocolitica might play an important role in the pathogenic process, which is distinct from other pathogens, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == presence of quorum-sensing systems associated with multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes 1-2% of the natural microbiota of the human digestive tract and is the predominant anaerobic opportunistic pathogen in gastrointestinal infections. most bacteria use quorum sensing (qs) to monitor cell density in relation to other cells and their environment. in gram-negative bacteria, the luxri system is common. the luxr gene encodes a transcriptional activator inducible by type i acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers (e.g., n-[3-oxohexanoyl] homoserine lactone and hexanoyl homoserine lactone [c6-hsl]). this study investigated the presence of qs system(s) in b. fragilis. the genome of american-type culture collection strain no. atcc25285 was searched for qs genes. the strain was grown to late exponential phase in the presence or absence  of synthetic c6-hsl and c8-hsl or natural homoserine lactones from cell-free supernatants from spent growth cultures of other bacteria. growth, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, efflux pump gene (bmeb) expression, and biofilm formation were measured. nine luxr and no luxi orthologues were found. c6-hsl and supernatants from yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa caused a significant (1) reduction in cellular density and (2) increases in expression of four putative luxr genes, bmeb3, bmeb6, bmeb7, and bmeb10, resistance to various antibiotics, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (cccp, an uncoupler that dissipates the transmembrane proton gradient, which is also the driving force of resistance nodulation division efflux pumps) and (3) increase in biofilm formation. susceptibility of atcc25285 to c6-hsl was also reduced by cccp. these data suggest that (1) b. fragilis contains putative luxr orthologues, which could respond to exogenous homoserine lactones and modulate biofilm formation, bmeb efflux pump expression, and susceptibility to antibiotics, and (2) bmeb efflux pumps could transport homoserine lactones.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

TI  == bacteria induce ctgf and cyr61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  == cysteine-rich protein 61 (cyr61/ccn1) and connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) are members of the ccn (cyr61, ctgf, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an  important role in wound healing. this study focused on the nature of the so far unknown ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. we demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pyv leads to the expression of cyr61 and ctgf. virulent y. enterocolitica bearing the pyv virulence plasmid suppressed the mrna expression of these genes. yersinia-mediated inhibition of ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease yopt. further characterization of the yersinia factors, which trigger ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. beside yersinia, several other bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, or staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced ctgf and cyr61 expression. blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) receptor-specific inhibitor ki16425 suggest a general involvement of lpa receptors in bacteria-triggered ctgf and cyr61 expression. these data suggest that lpa receptor-dependent expression of ctgf and cyr61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.

TI  == function and molecular architecture of the yersinia injectisome tip complex.
AB  == by quantitative immunoblot analyses and scanning transmission electron microscopy (stem), we determined that the needle of the yersinia enterocolitica e40 injectisome consists of 139 +/- 19 yscf subunits and that the tip complex is formed by three to five lcrv monomers. a pentamer represented the best fit for an atomic model of this complex. the n-terminal globular domain of lcrv forms the base of the tip complex, while the central globular domain forms the head. hybrids between lcrv and its orthologues pcrv (pseudomonas aeruginosa) or acrv (aeromonas salmonicida) were engineered and recombinant y. enterocolitica expressing the different hybrids were tested for their capacity to form the translocation pore by a haemolysis assay. there was a good correlation between haemolysis, insertion of yopb into erythrocyte membranes and interaction between  yopb and the n-terminal globular domain of the tip complex subunit. hence, the base of the tip complex appears to be critical for the functional insertion of yopb into the host cell membrane.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

AB  == the effect of aqueous chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) on controlling foodborne pathogens, yeasts, and molds on blueberries was studied. five pathogens were spot-inoculated on the skin of blueberries. a sachet containing necessary chemicals for generation of clo(2) was used to provide 320 ppm of clo(2) in 7.5 l of water. the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 ppm) of clo(2) and various contact times (10s; 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 min; and 1h and 2h) were  studied. clo(2) was most effective in reducing listeria monocytogenes (4.88 log cfu/g) as compared to the other pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by  2.16 log cfu/g after 5 min when treated with 15 ppm of clo(2). relatively short treatment time was more effective in reducing salmonella typhimurium than longer  treatment time for most concentrations. the highest reduction (4.56 log cfu/g) of staphylococcus aureus was achieved with 15 ppm of clo(2) for 30 min. when treated for 2h with 5 ppm of clo(2), yersinia enterocolitica was reduced by 3.49 log cfu/g. fifteen ppm of clo(2) reduced natural yeasts and molds by 2.82 log cfu/g after 1h. concentrations of clo(2) decreased over time. when exposed to blueberries, clo(2) concentrations were further reduced, showing significant degradation.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == occurrence of n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones in extracts of some gram-negative bacteria evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == acylated homoserine lactones (ahls) are self-generated signal molecules that mediate population density-dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of gram-negative bacteria. these signal molecules diffuse from bacterial  cells and accumulate in the medium as a function of cell growth. in selected foods ahls contribute to product spoilage. as different bacterial species produce ahl analogs that differ in length of the n-acyl chain, ranging from 4 to 14 carbons and in the substitution at the c-3 position of the side chain (i.e., oxo  or hydroxyl group), the suitability and applicability of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry direct method for characterizing trace amounts of ahls was evaluated using n-heptanoyl-homoserine lactone as internal standard.  crude cell-free supernatants of bacterial cultures of aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, yersinia  enterocolitica, and serratia liquefaciens were screened for ahl production in selected ion monitoring mode, using the prominent fragment at m/z 143. the observed profiles of distinguishable n-acyl-homoserine lactones occurring in bacterial extracts were compared and discussed. the presence of a labile 3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone was evidenced but serious difficulties arose in  estimating its concentration as thermal degradation occurs during the gas chromatographic separation. its electron impact mass spectra was, however, given  and interpreted.

TI  == the structure of mbti from mycobacterium tuberculosis, the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of the siderophore mycobactin, reveals it to be a salicylate synthase.
AB  == the ability to acquire iron from the extracellular environment is a key determinant of pathogenicity in mycobacteria. mycobacterium tuberculosis acquires iron exclusively via the siderophore mycobactin t, the biosynthesis of which depends on the production of salicylate from chorismate. salicylate production in other bacteria is either a two-step process involving an isochorismate synthase (chorismate isomerase) and a pyruvate lyase, as observed for pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a single-step conversion catalyzed by a salicylate synthase, as with yersinia enterocolitica. here we present the structure of the enzyme mbti (rv2386c) from m. tuberculosis, solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at a resolution of 1.8 a, and biochemical evidence that it is the salicylate synthase necessary for mycobactin biosynthesis. the enzyme is critically dependent on mg2+ for activity and produces salicylate via an isochorismate intermediate. mbti is structurally similar to salicylate synthase (irp9) from y.  enterocolitica and the large subunit of anthranilate synthase (trpe) and shares the overall architecture of other chorismate-utilizing enzymes, such as the related aminodeoxychorismate synthase pabb. like irp9, but unlike trpe or pabb, mbti is neither regulated by nor structurally stabilized by bound tryptophan. the structure of mbti is the starting point for the design of inhibitors of siderophore biosynthesis, which may make useful lead compounds for the production of new antituberculosis drugs, given the strong dependence of pathogenesis on iron acquisition in m. tuberculosis.

AB  == background and objectives: photodynamic treatment (pdt) with the cationic porphyrin, mono-phenyl-tri-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin chloride [tri-p(4)], has previously been shown to be effective at inactivating vesicle stomatitis virus (vsv) in red cell concentrates (rcc) with limited damage to red blood cells (rbc). the aim of this study was to determine the pathogen-inactivating capacity  of pdt with tri-p(4) for a broader range of pathogens and to establish the associated effect on in vitro rbc quality. materials and methods: a series of viruses and bacteria was spiked into 60% rcc. pathogen inactivation was determined after pdt with 25 microm tri-p(4) and red light up to 360 kj/m2. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected cells were evaluated for cell death induction, and rcc were analysed for the induction of haemolysis and atp content. results: for the lipid-enveloped viruses bovine viral diarrhoea virus, hiv and pseudorabies virus, and for the gram positive bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, and the gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa and yersinia enterolitica, inactivation of > or = 5 log10 was measured after 60 min of pdt with tri-p(4). the required treatment time to achieve this level of inactivation was four times  longer than required for vsv. for cell-associated hiv, only 1.7 log10 of inactivation was found, despite clear induction of cell death of hiv-infected cells. the non-enveloped virus, canine parvovirus, was completely resistant to the treatment. pdt of rcc with tri-p(4) for 60 min, and subsequent storage in as-3, resulted in 4% haemolysis after 35 days of storage. the atp content of untreated and treated rbc declined with similar kinetics during storage. conclusion: pdt of rcc with tri-p(4) for 60 min inactivates a wide range of pathogens, but not cell-associated hiv and a non-enveloped virus, and compromises rbc quality. this reduces the suitability of pdt with tri-p(4) for red cell sterilization. therefore, further improvements in the treatment procedures to potentiate pathogen inactivation and to preserve rbc integrity will be required to generate an effective treatment for sterilizing rcc.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == long- and short-chain plant-produced bacterial n-acyl-homoserine lactones become  components of phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and soil.
AB  == two n-acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-hsl) synthase genes, lasi from pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeni from yersinia enterocolitica, were introduced into tobacco, individually and in combination. liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography confirmed products of lasi and yeni activity in single and cotransformants. cotransformants expressing plastid-localized lasi and yeni synthases produced the major acyl-hsls for each synthase in all tissues tested. total acyl-hsl signals accumulated in leaf tissue up to 3 pmol/mg of fresh weight, half as much in stem tissue, and approximately 10-fold less in root tissues. acyl-hsls were present in aqueous leaf washes from greenhouse-grown transgenic plants. transgenic lines grown for 14 days under axenic conditions produced detectable levels of acyl-hsls in root exudates. ethyl acetate extractions of rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil from transgenically grown plants contained active acyl-hsls, whereas plant-free soil or rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil from wild-type plants lacked detectable amounts of acyl-hsls. this work shows that bioactive acyl-hsls are exuded from leaves and roots and accumulate in the phytosphere of plants engineered to produce acyl-hsls. these data further suggest that plants that are bioengineered to synthesize acyl-hsls can foster beneficial plant-bacteria communications or deter deleterious interactions. therefore, it is feasible to use bioengineered plants to supplement soils with specific acyl-hsls to modulate bacterial phenotypes and plant-associated bacterial community structures.

TI  == comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeikticus)  and five gram-negative bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium). the lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or hewl, and mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus or m1l), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or lal, bacteriophage t4 lysozyme or t4l, goose egg white lysozyme or gewl, and cauliflower lysozyme or cfl). t4l, lal and gewl were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of sds-page gels and zymogram analysis while cfl was only partially pure. at ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. high pressure treatment (130-300 mpa, 25 degrees c, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. m. lysodeikticus and p. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, s. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. the possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == functional analysis of the post-transcriptional regulator rsma reveals a novel rna-binding site.
AB  == the rsma family of rna-binding proteins are global post-transcriptional regulators that mediate extensive changes in gene expression in bacteria. they bind to, and affect the translation rate of target mrnas, a function that is further modulated by one or more, small, untranslated competitive regulatory rnas. to gain new insights into the nature of this protein/rna interaction, we used x-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the yersinia enterocolitica  rsma homologue. rsma consists of a dimeric beta barrel from which two alpha helices are projected. from structure-based alignments of the rsma protein family from diverse bacteria, we identified key amino acid residues likely to be involved in rna-binding. site-specific mutagenesis revealed that arginine at position 44, located at the n terminus of the alpha helix is essential for biological activity in vivo and rna-binding in vitro. mutation of this site affects swarming motility, exoenzyme and secondary metabolite production in the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbon metabolism in escherichia coli, and hydrogen cyanide production in the plant beneficial strain pseudomonas fluorescens cha0. r44a mutants are also unable to interact with the small untranslated rna, rsmz. thus, although possessing a motif similar to the kh domain of some eukaryotic rna-binding proteins, rsma differs substantially and incorporates a novel class of rna-binding site.

TI  == pscf is a major component of the pseudomonas aeruginosa type iii secretion needle.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, translocates exoenzymes (exo) directly into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm. this is accomplished by a type iii secretion/translocation machinery. here, we show that  the p. aeruginosa type iii secretory needle structure is composed essentially of  pscf, a protein required for secretion and p. aeruginosa cytotoxicity. partially  purified needles, detached from the bacterial surface, are 60-80 nm in length and 7 nm in width, resembling needles from yersinia spp.. yscf of yersinia enterocolitica was able to functionally complement the pscf deletion, but required 11 p. aeruginosa-specific amino acids at the n-terminus for its function.

TI  == solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == protective anti-v antibodies inhibit pseudomonas and yersinia translocon assembly within host membranes.
AB  == pathogenic yersinia species and pseudomonas aeruginosa share a similar type iii secretion/translocation system. the translocation system consists of 3 secreted proteins, yopb/popb, yopd/popd, and lcrv/pcrv; the latter is known to be a protective antigen. in an in vitro assay, the translocation system causes the lysis of erythrocytes infected with wild-type (wt) p. aeruginosa. wt y. enterocolitica is not hemolytic, but a multiknockout mutant deprived of all the effectors and of yopn ( delta hopemn) is hemolytic. in the presence of antibodies against pcrv and y. pestis lcrv, the hemolytic activity of p. aeruginosa was inhibited. similarly, the hemolytic activity of delta hopemn was inhibited in the presence of anti-lcrv antibodies. the assembly of the translocon, composed of popb/d and yopb/d proteins, was disturbed in immunoprotected erythrocyte membranes, mimicking the phenotypes of v knockout mutants. thus, protective antibodies against the v antigens of yersinia species and p. aeruginosa act at the level of the formation of the translocon pore in membranes of infected host cells by blocking the function of lcrv/pcrv. the hemolysis assay could be adapted for high-throughput screening of anti-infectious compounds that specifically target the type iii translocon.

TI  == occurrence of sublethal injury after pulsed electric fields depending on the micro-organism, the treatment medium ph and the intensity of the treatment investigated.
AB  == aims: the objective was to investigate the occurrence of sublethal injury after pulsed electric field (pef) depending on the treatment time, the electric field strength and the ph of the treatment media in two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis ssp. niger, listeria monocytogenes) and six gram-negative (escherichia coli, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella serotype senftenberg 775w, salmonella serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica) bacterial strains. methods and results: a characteristic behaviour was observed for the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria studied. whereas gram-positive bacteria showed a higher pef resistance at ph 7.0, the gram-negative were more resistant at ph 4.0. in these conditions, in which bacteria showed their maximum  resistance, a large proportion of sublethally injured cells were detected. in most cases, the longer the treatment time and the higher the electric field applied, the greater the proportion of sublethally injured cells that were detected. no sublethal injury was detected when gram-positive bacteria were treated at ph 4.0 and gram-negative at ph 7.0. conclusions: sublethal injury was  detected after pef so, bacterial inactivation by pef is not an 'all or nothing' event. significance and impact of the study: this work could be useful for improving food preservation by pef.

TI  == characterization of a type iii secretion substrate specificity switch (t3s4) domain in yscp from yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the length of the needle ending the yersinia ysc injectisome is determined by yscp, a protein acting as a molecular ruler. in addition, yscp is required for yop secretion. in the present paper, by a systematic deletion analysis, we localized accurately the region required for yop secretion between residues 405 and 500. as this c-terminal region of yscp has also been shown to control needle  length it probably represents the substrate specificity switch of the machinery.  by a bioinformatics analysis, we show that this region has a globular structure,  an original alpha/beta fold, a p-x-l-g signature and presumably no catalytic activity. in spite of very limited sequence similarities, this structure is conserved among the proteins that are presumed to control the needle length in many different injectisomes and also among members of the flik family, which control the flagellar hook length. this region thus represents a new protein domain that we called t3s4 for type iii secretion substrate specificity switch. the t3s4 domain of yscp can be replaced by the t3s4 domain of ascp (aeromonas salmonicida) or pscp (pseudomonas aeruginosa) but not by the one from flik, indicating that in spite of a common global structure, these domains need to fit  their partner proteins in the secretion apparatus.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == reduced virulence of a hfq mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa o1.
AB  == the sm-like protein hfq has been implicated in the regulation of sigmas-dependent and sigmas-independent genes in e. coli and in the regulation of virulence factors in both, yersinia enterocolitica and brucella abortus. here, we have studied the effect of hfq on virulence and stress response of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pao1). we have constructed a pao1hfq- mutant and a pao1hfq-rpos- double mutant to permit distinction between direct and indirect effects of hfq. when compared to the wild-type and the rpos- strains, the hfq knock out strain showed a reduced growth rate and was unable to utilize glucose as a sole carbon source. elastase activity was 80% reduced in the hfq- mutant when compared to the wild-type or the rpos- strain, whereas alginate production seemed to be solely affected by sigmas. the production of catalase and pyocyanin was shown to be affected in an additive manner by both, hfq and sigmas. moreover, twitching and swarming mediated by typeiv pili was shown to be impaired in the hfq- mutant. when compared to pao1 wild-type and the rpos- mutant, the hfq- mutant decreased virulence in galleria mellonella by a factor of 1 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(3), respectively. likewise, when compared to wild-type, the pao1hfq- mutant was significantly attenuated in virulence when administered intraperitoneally in mice. these results strongly suggest that hfq is a global regulator of pao1 virulence and stress response which is not exclusively due to its role in stimulating the synthesis of sigmas.

TI  == reduction of iron by extracellular iron reductases: implications for microbial iron acquisition.
AB  == the extracellular enzymatic reduction of iron by microorganisms has not been appropriately considered. in this study the reduction and release of iron from ferrioxamine were examined using extracellular microbial iron reductases and compared to iron mobilization by chemical reductants, and to chelation by edta and desferrioxamine. a flavin semiquinone was formed during the enzymatic reduction of ferrioxamine, which was consistent with the 1 e(-) reduction of iron by an enzyme. the rates for the enzymatic reactions were substantially faster than both the 2 e(-) chemical reductions and the chelation reactions. the rapid rates of the enzymatic reduction reactions demonstrated that these enzymes are capable of accomplishing the extracellular mobilization of iron required by microorganisms. the data suggest that mechanistically there are two phases for the mobilization and transport of iron by those microorganisms that produce both  extracellular iron reductases and siderophores, with reduction being the principle pathway.

AB  == the method of suppressive subtractive hybridization was employed to map out genomic differences between the highly pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica (ye) biogroup 1b, serotype o:8 strain (wa-314) and the closely related apathogenic y.  enterocolitica biogroup 1a, serotype o:5 strain (nf-o). a novel is10-like element, is1330, uncovered by this technique was found to be uniquely present in  high copy numbers among the highly pathogenic y. enterocolitica 1b strains, while a single copy of the element was found in the low pathogenic ye biogroup 4 serotype o:3 strain. the 1321-bp repetitive element has 19-bp imperfect inverted  terminal repeats and is bracketed by a 10-bp duplication of the target sequence.  the predicted transposase shares high homology with the is10 open reading frame of the large virulence plasmid pwr501, of shigella flexneri, with is10 transposase of salmonella typhi, and with is1999 (tnpa) of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the is1330 tnp gene is transcribed in vitro and in vivo in hela cells. at least one copy of is1330 flanks the recently described chromosomal type iii secretion cluster in y. enterocolitica wa-314, o:8, and future studies should shed light on whether this novel transposase mediates transposition events in highly pathogenic y. enterocolitica strains, thus enhancing the genetic plasticity of this species.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica evasion of the host innate immune response by v antigen-induced il-10 production of macrophages is abrogated in il-10-deficient mice.
AB  == the virulence-associated v ag (lcrv) of pathogenic yersinia species is part of the translocation apparatus, required to deliver antihost effector proteins (yersinia outer proteins) into host cells. an orthologous protein (denoted as pcrv) has also been identified in the exos regulon of pseudomonas aeruginosa. additionally, it is known that lcrv is released by yersiniae into the environment and that lcrv causes an immunosuppressive effect when injected into mice. in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that rlcrv, but not pcrv, is capable of  suppressing tnf-alpha production in zymosan a-stimulated mouse macrophages and the human monocytic mono-mac-6 cell line. the underlying mechanism of tnf-alpha suppression could be assigned to lcrv-mediated il (il)-10 production, because 1)  lcrv induces il-10 release in macrophages, 2) anti-il-10 ab treatment completely  abrogated tnf-alpha suppression, and 3) tnf-alpha suppression was absent in lcrv-treated macrophages of il-10-deficient (il-10-/-) mice. the relevance of lcrv-mediated immunosuppression for the pathogenicity of yersiniae became evident by experimental infection of mice; in contrast to wild-type mice, il-10-/- mice were highly resistant against yersinia infection, as shown by lower bacterial load in spleen and liver, absent abscess formation in these organs, and survival.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  == interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. however, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. the induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. nf(kappa)b or map-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the  infected cell. host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. however, in some infections, apoptosis of  mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == the beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley,  and rosemary were evaluated. inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o:157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus plantarum, aspergillus niger, geotrichum, and rhodotorula. oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (mlc, approximately 8 ppm). coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (mlc, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to e. coli o:157:h7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

AB  == a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the  control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.

TI  == essential pchg-dependent reduction in pyochelin biosynthesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the biosynthetic genes pchdcba and pchef, which are known to be required for the  formation of the siderophore pyochelin and its precursors salicylate and dihydroaeruginoate (dha), are clustered with the pchr regulatory gene on the chromosome of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the 4.6-kb region located downstream of the pchef genes was found to contain three additional, contiguous genes, pchg, pchh,  and pchi, probably forming a pchefghi operon. the deduced amino acid sequences of pchh and pchi are similar to those of atp binding cassette transport proteins with an export function. pchg is a homolog of the yersinia pestis and y. enterocolitica proteins ybtu and irp3, which are involved in the biosynthesis of  yersiniabactin. a null mutation in pchg abolished pyochelin formation, whereas mutations in pchh and pchi did not affect the amounts of salicylate, dha, and pyochelin produced. the pyochelin biosynthetic genes were expressed from a vector promoter, uncoupling them from fur-mediated repression by iron and pchr-dependent induction by pyochelin. in a p. aeruginosa mutant lacking the entire pyochelin biosynthetic gene cluster, the expressed pchdcba and pchefg genes were sufficient for salicylate, dha, and pyochelin production. pyochelin formation was also obtained in the heterologous host escherichia coli expressing pchdcba and pchefg  together with the e. coli entd gene, which provides a phosphopantetheinyl transferase necessary for pche and pchf activation. the pchg protein was purified and used in combination with pchd and phosphopantetheinylated pche and pchf in vitro to produce pyochelin from salicylate, l-cysteine, atp, nadph, and s-adenosylmethionine. based on this assay, a reductase function was attributed to pchg. in summary, this study completes the identification of the biosynthetic genes required for pyochelin formation from chorismate in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. it has enhanced activity against gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antigram-negative activity. for example, the mic(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), legionella species, mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), neisseria species, most enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella species, vibrio species and yersinia enterocolitica. for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia species, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, the mic(90) are elevated. gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections.  the side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.

TI  == yscp, a yersinia protein required for yop secretion that is surface exposed, and  released in low ca2+.
AB  == the yersinia ysc apparatus is made of more than 20 proteins, 11 of which have homologues in many type iii systems. here, we characterize yscp from yersinia enterocolitica. this 515-residue protein has a high proline content, a large tandem repetition and a slow migration in sds-page. unlike the products of neighbouring genes, it has a counterpart only in pseudomonas aeruginosa and it varies even between yersinia ysc machineries. an yscpdelta97-465 mutant was unable to secrete any yop, even under conditions overcoming feedback inhibition of yop synthesis. interestingly, a cloned yscpdelta57-324 from yersinia pestis introduced in the yscpdelta97-465 mutant can sustain a significant yop secretion  and thus partially complemented the mutation. this explains the leaky phenotype observed with the yscp mutant of y. pestis. in accordance with this secretion deficiency, yscp is required for the delivery of yop effectors into macrophages.  mechanical shearing, immunolabelling and electron microscopy experiments showed that yscp is exposed at the bacterial surface when bacteria are incubated at 37 degrees c in the presence of ca2+ and thus do not secrete yops. at 37 degrees c,  when ca2+ ions are chelated, yscp is released like a yop protein. we conclude that yscp is a part of the ysc injectisome which is localized at the bacterial surface and is destabilized by ca2+ chelation.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae hrp type iii secretion system and effector proteins.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type iii secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. in p. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the hrp (type iii secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. the hrp/hrc genes of p. syringae pv syringae 61, p. syringae pv syringae b728a, and p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic hrp pathogenicity island (pai) that is linked to a trna(leu) gene found also in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to hrp system genes. cosmid phir11 carries a portion of the strain 61 hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct escherichia coli  and pseudomonas fluorescens to inject hoppsya into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. large deletions in strain dc3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor  role in growth in tomato. p. syringae secretes hoppsya and avrpto in culture in a hrp-dependent manner at ph and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. avrpto is also secreted by yersinia enterocolitica. the secretion of avrpto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an npt reporter from y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal  targeting signal is recognized by the type iii secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.

TI  == norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth but does not increase pathogenicity of  salmonella choleraesuis in an in vivo model.
AB  == norepinephrine stimulates growth of escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in serum-supplemented media, and in vivo increases in  norepinephrine may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis by gram-negative bacteria. because salmonellosis often is associated with stress, the effects of norepinephrine on in vitro growth, and in vivo pathogenicity of the swine pathogen salmonella choleraesuis were investigated. when rpmi 1640 with and without pig serum was inoculated with fewer than 100 s. choleraesuis/ml and incubated overnight, bacterial numbers were 10(4) to 10(6) lower in rpmi containing serum. norepinephrine restored bacterial growth in rpmi with serum to  normal levels, but it did not increase growth in serum-free rpmi. similar results were obtained with sapi, a nutrient-poor medium previously used to study the effect of norepinephrine on growth of gram-negative bacteria. conditioned media were produced by growing s. choleraesuis in rpmi containing serum with and without norepinephrine and filter sterilizing. conditioned medium produced with norepinephrine stimulated growth of s. choleraesuis but not e. coli, whereas conditioned medium produced without norepinephrine stimulated growth of both bacteria. to determine the in vivo effects of norepinephrine, rats were implanted with tablets that secrete norepinephrine for 20 to 24 hours or with identical tablets without norepinephrine and infected intraperitoneally with graded doses of s. choleraesuis. the ld-50 of s. choleraesuis was the same in both groups, and norepinephrine did not affect the carrier rate at 30 days after infection. we concluded that although norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth of s. choleraesuis in serum-based media, the increase in norepinephrine levels in the present in vivo system was probably not sufficient to influence the pathogenesis  of s. choleraesuis infection.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of l4-mediated autogenous control of the s10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  == we investigated the regulation of the s10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes escherichia coli. in e. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein l4. this regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mrna. secondary structure analysis of the s10 leaders  of five enterobacteria (salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, yersinia enterocolitica, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii) and two nonenteric  members of the gamma subdivision (haemophilus influenzae and vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the e. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for l4-mediated autogenous control in e. coli. moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to l4 oversynthesis in e. coli. our results suggest that an e. coli-like l4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. however, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required s10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by l4 in e. coli. we speculate that l4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.

TI  == induction of cytokine synthesis by flagella from gram-negative bacteria may be dependent on the activation or differentiation state of human monocytes.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that salmonellae, but not escherichia coli or yersinia enterocolitica, stimulates tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) production in the human promonocytic cell line u38. subsequent analysis revealed  that the tnfalpha-inducing activity of salmonellae was associated with flagellin, a major component of flagella from gram-negative bacteria. in the present study,  we have explored the basis for the apparent specificity of action of salmonella flagella on tnfalpha expression in u38 cells and have extended this analysis to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). flagella from the enteropathogenic e. coli strain e2348/69, y. enterocolitica jb580, and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, which did not induce significant levels of tnfalpha  production in u38 cells, were as potent as salmonella flagella in terms of tnfalpha and interleukin 1beta activation in pbmc. however, tnfalpha production in u38 cells was greatly enhanced when these cells were stimulated with flagella  from e. coli, y. enterocolitica, and p. aeruginosa in the presence of a costimulant, phorbol 13-myristate acetate. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation or differentiation state of a monocyte may have a  substantial effect on the cell's responsiveness to flagellum stimulation of cytokine synthesis. furthermore, these results indicate that cytokine induction in monocytes may be a general property of flagella from gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a complex composed of sycn and yscb functions as a specific chaperone for yopn in yersinia pestis.
AB  == human pathogenic yersinia resist host defences, in part through the expression and delivery of a set of plasmid-encoded virulence proteins termed yops. a number of these yops are exported from the bacteria directly into the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic host's cells upon contact with these cells. the secreted yopn protein  (also known as lcre) is required to block yop secretion in the presence of calcium in vitro or before contact with a eukaryotic cell in vivo. in this study, we characterize the role of the tyea, sycn and yscb gene products in the regulation of yop secretion in yersinia pestis. mutants specifically defective in the expression of tyea, sycn or yscb were no longer able to block yop secretion in the presence of calcium. in addition, the secretion of yopn was specifically reduced in both the sycn and the yscb deletion mutants. protein cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies in conjunction with yeast two-hybrid analyses showed  that sycn and yscb interact with one another to form a sycn/yscb complex. yeast three-hybrid analyses demonstrated that the sycn/yscb complex, but not sycn or yscb alone, specifically associates with yopn. sycn and yscb share amino acid sequence similarity and structural similarities with the specific yop chaperones  syce and sych. together, these results indicate that a complex composed of sycn and yscb functions as a specific chaperone for yopn in y. pestis.

AB  == the rfah protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of escherichia coli and salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, f conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. rfah is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases  transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. the operons of the rfah-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of rfah. the ops element is  also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae and klebsiella pneumoniae and the rp4 fertility operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. the mechanistic coupling of rfah and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits rfah and potentially other factors to the rna polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to  proceed over long distances.

AB  == in rhizobium etli cfn42, both the symbiotic plasmid (pd) and plasmid b (pb) are required for effective bean nodulation. this is due to the presence on pb of a region (lps beta) involved in lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis. we report here the genetic array and functional features of this plasmid-borne region. the  sequence analysis of a 3,595-bp fragment revealed the presence of a transcriptional unit integrated by two open reading frames (lps beta 1 and lps beta 2) essential for lps biosynthesis and symblosis. the lps beta 1 encodes a putative 193 amino acid polypeptide that shows strong homology with glucosyl-1p and galactosyl-1p transferases. the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by lps beta 2 was very similar to that of proteins involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa wpbm, bordetella pertussis bpil, and yersinia enterocolitica trsg. dna sequences homologous to lps beta 1 and lps beta 2 of r. etli cfn42 were consistently found in functionally equivalent plasmids of r. etli, r. leguminosarum bv. viciae, and r. leguminosarum hv. trifolii strains, but not in r. meliloti, r. loti, r. tropici, r. fredii, bradyrhizobium, azorhizobium, and agrobacterium tumefaciens. even though rhizobium and agrobacterium do not share lps beta sequences, their presence is required for crown-gall tumor induction by r. etli transconjugants carrying the ti plasmid.

AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == a simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  == the muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). though sensitive, the hplc procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. we have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (face) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid,  after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to uv light. face detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and yersinia enterocolitica.  as little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic hplc technique. thus, face may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by hplc, or face may eventually replace hplc for some applications.

TI  == physical and structural characterization of yersiniophore, a siderophore produced by clinical isolates of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == clinical isolates of yersinia enterocolitca, which belong to mouse-lethal serotypes, produce the siderophore yersiniophore. siderophore production was shown to be iron regulated and to reach maximum production in late log phase. yersiniophore is a fluorescent siderophore with maximum excitation at 270 nm and  a major emission peak at 428 nm. absorption maxima were seen at 210 and 250 nm with a low broad peak from 280 to 320 nm. purification of unchelated yersiniophore for structural analysis was made difficult by low yields (1-2 mg mg-1), and susceptibility to acid hydrolysis, oxidation and possibly polymerization. yersinophore was therefore purified as an al3+ chelate, which was found to be stable in solution for several weeks. to purify al(3+)-yersinophore,  unchelated yersiniophore was first extracted from culture supernatants with dichloromethane, concentrated by rotary evaporation and adsorbed to a deae-sephacel column. al(3+)-yersiniophore was eluted with 0.01 m alcl3 and further purified by hplc. the structure was established by a combination of elemental analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry and two-dimensional nmr experiments. yersiniophore is a phenolate-thiazole siderophore with the formula c21h24n3o4s3al and a molecular weight of 505.07404 when chelated to al3+. the structure of yersiniophore was determined to be closely related to the structures of pyochelin, produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anguibactin, produced by vibrio anguillarum.

TI  == [water disinfection: comparative activities of ozone and chlorine on a wide spectrum of bacteria].
AB  == ozone and chlorine are agents that disinfect by destroying, neutralizing or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. the treatment of drinking water with ozone has shown to be more efficient against spores of bacillus subtilis. it was observed that the ozone already in dose of 0.35 mg/l produced the reduction of at least 5 log in populations of approximately 1 x 10(6) cells/ml of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. with a dose of 0.50 mg/l of chlorine, the reduction was much smaller for the tested microorganisms (except vibrio cholerae), while the effect of 2 mg/l of chlorine was similar to the ozone treatment. for spores of bacillus subtilis, the reduction observed with ozone concentrations of 0.35 and 0.70 mg/l was of almost 3 log, while no considerable effect was obtained with chlorine in the tested conditions. our results have shown that both disinfectans were consumed during the treatment period, probably  because of the own water demand and the added bacterial mass.

AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == analyses of the dna-binding and transcriptional activation properties of exsa, the transcriptional activator of the pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme s regulon.
AB  == exsa has been implicated as a central regulator of exoenzyme s production by pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, the dna-binding and transcriptional activation properties of exsa were investigated. exsa was produced and purified as a fusion protein, mala3a2, which was shown to bind specifically to promoter regions that regulated transcription of the exoenzyme s trans-regulatory locus (pc) and a locus located directly downstream of exsa (pd). previously, mala3a2 was shown to bind the exos 5' psti-nsii region, which contained two independent but coordinately regulated (exsa-mediated) promoters, ps' (now termed porf1) and  ps. dnase i footprint analysis of the promoter regions bound by exsa revealed a common protected consensus sequence of txaaaaxa. the consensus sequence was located -51 to -52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites for pd, ps, and porf1. promoter fusion, dna-binding, and mutagenesis analysis indicated that the  consensus sequence was important for transcriptional activation. each exsa-controlled promoter region contained at least two consensus sites in close proximity, similar to the arrangement of half-sites seen in arac-controlled (escherichia coli) or virf-controlled (yersinia enterocolitica) promoters. however, the results of this study suggested that only one consensus site was required in the exoenzyme s (ps) or orf1 promoter (porf1) to initiate transcription. these data suggest that members of the exoenzyme s regulon can be  defined as possessing an exsa consensus element which maps at bp -51 or -52 relative to the transcriptional start site.

TI  == virg, a yersinia enterocolitica lipoprotein involved in ca2+ dependency, is related to exsb of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pathogenic yersiniae require ca2+ for growth at 37 degrees c. they harbor closely related plasmids of about 70 kb that are essential for virulence. at 37 degrees c and in the absence of ca2+ ions, these plasmids cause a decrease in growth rate and the release of large amounts of proteins called yops. here we describe the virg gene of yersinia enterocolitica; virg is located just upstream of the virf gene, which encodes the transcriptional activator of some plasmid virulence factors. analysis of the virg amino acid sequence suggested that virg encodes a lipoprotein, which was confirmed by [3h]palmitate labeling of virg-phoa fusion proteins. a nonpolar virg mutant was constructed and found to be ca2+ independent for growth at 37 degrees c but to still secrete yops. this phenotype was complemented by the introduction of a plasmid harboring an intact virg gene. virg was found to be homologous to exsb, a protein encoded by a pseudomonas aeruginosa gene located in the locus controlling exoenzyme s synthesis. interestingly, the exsa gene, located just downstream of exsb, is also homologous to virf.

TI  == the bacterial 'enigma': cracking the code of cell-cell communication.
AB  == in recent years it has become clear that the production of n-acyl homoserine lactones (n-ahls) is widespread in gram-negative bacteria. these molecules act as diffusible chemical communication signals (bacterial pheromones) which regulate diverse physiological processes including bioluminescence, antibiotic production, plasmid conjugal transfer and synthesis of exoenzyme virulence factors in plant and animal pathogens. the paradigm for n-ahl production is in the bioluminescence (lux) phenotype of photobacterium fischeri (formerly classified as vibrio fischeri) where the signalling molecule n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) is synthesized by the action of the luxi protein. ohhl is thought to bind  to the luxr protein, allowing it to act as a positive transcriptional activator in an autoinduction process that physiologically couples cell density (and growth phase) to the expression of the bioluminescence genes. based on the growing information on luxi and luxr homologues in other n-ahl-producing bacterial species such as erwinia carotovora, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, agrobacterium tumefaciens and rhizobium leguminosarum, it seems that analogues of the p. fischeri lux autoinducer sensing system are widely distributed in bacteria. the general physiological function of these simple chemical signalling systems appears to be the modulation of discrete and diverse  metabolic processes in concert with cell density. in an evolutionary sense, the elaboration and action of these bacterial pheromones can be viewed as an example  of multicellularity in prokaryotic populations.

TI  == characterization of an lysr family protein, smer from serratia marcescens s6, its effect on expression of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase sme-1, and comparison of this regulator with other beta-lactamase regulators.
AB  == serratia marcescens s6 produces a chromosomally encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, sme-1 (t. naas, l. vandel, w. sougakoff, d. m. livermore, and p. nordmann, antimicrob. agents chemother. 38:1262-1270, 1994). upstream from smea we identified a second open reading frame (embl accession number z30237). this encodes a 33.1-kda protein, smer, which has a high degree of homology with nmcr, the lysr regulatory protein of the only other sequenced carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, nmca from enterobacter cloacae nor-1. it is weakly related to ampr of the chromosomal cephalosporinase regulatory systems described in e. cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter  freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and is very weakly related to other lysr-type regulators of class a beta-lactamases. smer is a weakly positive regulator for sme-1 expression in the absence of or in the presence of beta-lactam inducers. the -35 and -10 regions of smer are in the opposite orientations and are face-to-face relative to the smea promoter. smer acts similarly to nmcr and not as the ampr regulators described for class c beta-lactamase systems. smer is a weak inducer in the absence or presence of beta-lactams. as was found for the ampc-ampr and nmca-nmcr systems, a putative smer-binding site was present upstream from the beta-lactamase gene promoter regions. beta-galactosidase activity from a smer-lacz translational fusion was expressed constitutively and decreased in the presence of smer from a coresident  plasmid, suggesting that smer is autogeneously controlled. finally, beta-lactams  did not affect the expression of smer, which is the second regulator of a class a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase to be identified.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of a trans-regulatory locus required for exoenzyme  s synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == exoenzyme s is an adp-ribosyltransferase enzyme distinct from exotoxin a that is  synthesized and secreted by pseudomonas aeruginosa. yields of exoenzyme s are variable and depend on strain and growth conditions. since certain medium additives are required for exoenzyme s production, its regulation may be influenced by environmental stimuli. in this study, we have cloned a region that  complements the exoenzyme s-deficient phenotype of strain 388 exs1::tn1, a chromosomal tn1 insertional mutation. a large clone (28 kb) was shown to restore  both synthesis and secretory functions to the mutant strain. subcloning and tn501 mutagenesis experiments localized the region required for exoenzyme s synthesis to a 3.2-kb fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated several open reading frames. comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified exoenzyme s with predicted amino acid sequences of all open reading frames indicated that the structural gene was not encoded within the sequenced region. homology studies suggested that the region encoded three regulatory genes, exsc,  exsb, and exsa. exsa was homologous to the arac family of transcriptional activator proteins, with extensive homology being found with one member of this family, virf of yersinia enterocolitica. virf and exsa both contain carboxy-terminal domains with the helix-turn-helix motif of dna-binding proteins. the exsa gene product appeared to be required for induction of exoenzyme s synthesis above a low basal level. expression of exsa was demonstrated by cloning the region under the control of the t7 promoter. gene replacement experiments suggested that the expression of exsc affects the final yield of exoenzyme s.

AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == in vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, sce2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  == the therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, sce 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. enterobacter sakazakii, proteus spp. and shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (mic90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the mic90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia spp. were most susceptible to sce 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (mic90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and  piperacillin plus tazobactam. for citrobacter spp., providencia spp. and yersinia enterocolitica mic90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. flomoxef was between 2 to 4  log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 2 and 8 mg/l). morganella morganii and hafnia alvei were most  susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (mic90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while  cefotaxime (mic90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. sce 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) investigated (mic90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). the oxacephems were the least active compounds against nfb. cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90: 16 mg/l). haemophilus spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (mic90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  == experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (rt) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of  as-1 packed red cell (rbc) units contained in pl146 plastic bags. isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed rbc units. the units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees c for 14 days. on two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees c for 2 hours. timed samples taken during the periods at rt revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units,  and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. these results indicate that rt exposure of contaminated  rbc units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.

TI  == rapid enumeration of viable bacteria by image analysis.
AB  == a direct viable counting method for enumerating viable bacteria was modified and  made compatible with image analysis. a comparison was made between viable cell counts determined by the spread plate method and direct viable counts obtained using epifluorescence microscopy either manually or by automatic image analysis.  cultures of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated at 35 degrees c in a dilute nutrient medium containing nalidixic acid. filtered samples were stained for epifluorescence microscopy and analysed manually as well as by image analysis. cells enlarged after incubation were considered viable. the viable cell counts determined using image analysis were higher than those obtained by either  the direct manual count of viable cells or spread plate methods. the volume of sample filtered or the number of cells in the original sample did not influence the efficiency of the method. however, the optimal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5-20 micrograms ml-1) and length of incubation (4-8 h) varied with the culture tested. the results of this study showed that under optimal conditions, the modification of the direct viable count method in combination with image analysis microscopy provided an efficient and quantitative technique for counting viable bacteria in a short time.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody against the yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kda) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), was obtained by cell fusion. the crpa common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (igg1) thus obtained. the purified crpa showed a single band of 60 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and reacted with rabbit antisera against y. enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei in western blot analysis. the monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kda peptide from y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such  as v. cholerae, e. coli, s. sonnei, salmonella enteritidis, serratia marcescens,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. the results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on  a crpa molecule.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

AB  == by means of quantitative immuno-electrophoretic methods, 81 different antigens were demonstrated in sonicated preparations of yersinia enterocolitica, serogroup 0:3, using corresponding rabbit antiserum. only chromosomally-encoded antigens were demonstrated in this system. thirteen antigens were located on the bacterial surface, as demonstrated after absorption of rabbit antiserum with whole, killed  bacteria. five antigens resisted boiling. antigen no. 71 was identified as an important part of the lipopolysaccharide, and antigen no. 6 as the "common antigen" of pseudomonas aeruginosa. binding activities to concanavalin a (indicating the presence of carbohydrates), to limulus amoebocyte lysate and to polymyxin b (indicating the presence of possible endotoxin activity) were demonstrated for five, nine, and seven antigens, respectively. these observations, together with the presence of corresponding antibodies in pre-immune rabbit sera, as well as cross-reactivity with other gram-negative bacteria, indicate the biological importance of several of these antigens.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

AB  == direct plating or cold enrichment or both have been used to isolate yersinia spp. from feces. freeze-shock double enrichment and koh treatment have been recommended for recovery of yersinia enterocolitica from surface waters and food, respectively. these techniques were evaluated as alternatives for rapid recovery  of yersinia spp. from feces. stool samples were homogenized in buffered saline and autoclaved. escherichia coli. klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were each added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. yersinia cells were then added to a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(3), 1.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(5), or 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. a total of 21 strains of y. enterocolitica, 2 of yersinia kristensenii, and 1 each of yersinia intermedia and yersinia fredriksenii were tested. for freeze-shock double enrichment, seeded stool samples were frozen overnight (-70 degrees c), transferred successively to m-tetrathionate broth (6 h. 37 degrees c) and selenite broth (2 h 37 degrees c),  and plated on macconkey, salmonella-shigella, and cellobiose-arginine-lysine agars for quantitation. for koh treatment, seeded stool samples were mixed with 0.5% koh at a ratio of 1:2 for 2 min and plated as described above. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa were virtually eliminated after either method was used. all yersinia strains were recovered after koh treatment even at the lowest  initial concentration (1.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). however, after freeze-shock double enrichment, not all strains were retrievable, and those isolates which were recovered were grown only from samples containing the highest number of yersinia strains (1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml). koh treatment of stool samples seems to be a viable substitute for more protracted methods of recovering yersinia spp.

TI  == synthesis of a selective agar medium for yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a new agar medium for isolation of yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. the final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(cin) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees c or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees c. the medium was highly selective, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. colony morphology coupled with a differential  reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of y. enterocolitica from most of those gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. recovery and selective characteristics of cin agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. cin agar gave a higher recovery of y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than salmonella-shigella (0.0/0.7%) and macconkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.

TI  == effect of dyes on the quantitative recovery of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a total of 69 dyes were incorporated separately at different concentrations into  an agar medium for evaluation of their effects on the quantitative recovery of five serotypes of yersinia enterocolitica. one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of bacillus cereus were included for comparative purposes. certain dyes were evaluated further for their selective properties with five additional serotypes of y. enterocolitica, three strains of p. aeruginosa, and two of engerobacter spp. metanil yellow was the only dye which was tolerated bettr by y. enterocolitica than by p. aeruginosa. dye sensitivity was variable amond strains  of the same serotype of y. enterocolitica. in general, y. enterocolitica showed a tolerance to dyes greater than that of gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == relative importance of enterotoxigenic and invasive enteropathogenic bacteria in  infantile diarrhoea.
AB  == swedish children and adults (648 patients) with acute diarrhoea were investigated for enterotoxigenic strains in stool cultures. a total number 74 strains were isolated from 28 patients and assayed in the rabbit intestinal loop test and the  adrenal cell test. only three of the enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) isolates belonged to classical enteropathogenic serotypes of e. coli (epec). two enterotoxigenic strains of proteus morganii, two of enterobacter hafniae and one  of citrobacter freundii were isolated. none of 67 epec strains were found to produce a heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) in either of the two test systems. a number of yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from stool cultures often produced toxic effects in the cell test but no enterotoxin activity was detected for any of the strains investigated either in the adrenal cell test for heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) or the suckling mouse test for heat-stable enterotoxin (st). all epec isolates were also tested for st and for invasive properties in the sereny test; each isolate was negative in both test systems. it is concluded that production of lt and st enterotoxin were common in  stool isolates from ethiopian children but a rare phenomenon among swedish children with acute infantile diarrhoea. isolation of aerobic stool bacteria with invasive properties seems to be uncommon both in ethiopian and swedish children.  however, since both lt and st as well as invasive properties seem to be very unstable genetic properties in many of these stool isolates improved sensitive methods for the last two properties will probably change this picture in the future.

TI  == absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  == the absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, rh. viridis, rhodospirillum tenue, chromobacterium violaceum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bordetella pertussis, vibrio metchnikovii, vibrio cholerae, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica and fusobacterium nucleatum. the 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid l-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. with the aid of authentic d-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-o-substitution or  type of linkage, possess the d-configuration. 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is  present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the l-configuration.

TI  == common enterobacterial antigen in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by strains of yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) serotypes 3 and 9 (winblad), by strains of 5 different y.e. serogroups (wauters) and various other bacteria was examined. antibody against ca was raised by immunization of rabbits with e. coli o 14. extract prepared from s. typhimurium was used for the sensitization of sheep erythrocytes with ca. absorption and haemagglutination inhibition experiments showed that ca could be detected in heat extracts from all y.e. strains examined, and in that from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. ca was not detected in extracts from pasteurella multocida, francisella tularensis, brucella abortus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. anti-ca antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum  from rabbits immunized with y.e. bacteria, but were demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with a ca-containing fraction of the y.e. extract. the possibility of participation of anti-ca antibody in indirect haemagglutination tests for detection of antibody to y.e. o antigens is emphasized.

TI  == properties of r factors from bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  == genetic properties and host ranges of r factors derived from bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. all of 61 r factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. all of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, p1, p2, t1, t3, t6, t7, w31, and bf-23. they could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. an rte16, a representative r factor, was incompatible with both rp4 and r40a, which are classified as compatibility groups p and c, respectively. an rte16 was conjugally transmissible to b. bronchiseptica, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, but not to shigella flexneri, s. sonnei, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
