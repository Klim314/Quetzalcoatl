TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - A study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  - Semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. The number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. Standard methods were used for the investigations. Five main genera of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all patients. They included, the Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including Prevotella bivia, P. disiens, P. melanogenica, P. asaccharolytica and B. fragilis. The predominant flora was P. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. The semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). Similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.
