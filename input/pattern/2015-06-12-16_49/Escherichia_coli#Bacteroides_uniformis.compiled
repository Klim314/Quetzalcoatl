TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an agaro-oligosaccharide (AO)-hydrolyzing bacterium from the gut microflora of Chinese individuals.
AB  - Agarose (AP) from red algae has a long history as food ingredients in East Asia.  Agaro-oligosaccharides (AO) derived from AP have shown potential prebiotic effects. However, the human gut microbes responsible for the degradation of AO and AP have not yet been fully investigated. Here, we reported that AO and AP can be degraded and utilized at various rates by fecal microbiota obtained from different individuals. Bacteroides uniformis L8 isolated from human feces showed a pronounced ability to degrade AO and generate D-galactose as its final end product. PCR-DGGE analysis showed B. uniformis to be common in the fecal samples, but only B. uniformis L8 had the ability to degrade AO. A synergistic strain, here classified as Escherichia coli B2, was also identified because it could utilize the D-galactose as the growth substrate. The cross-feeding interaction between B. uniformis L8 and E. coli B2 led to exhaustion of the AO supply. Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium adolescentis can utilize one of the intermediates of AO hydrolysis, agarotriose. Growth curves indicated that AO was the substrate that most favorably sustained the growth of B. uniformis L8. In contrast, kappa-carrageenan oligosaccharides (KCO), guluronic acid oligosaccharides (GO), and mannuronic acid oligosaccharides (MO) were found to be unusable to B. uniformis L8. Current results indicate that B. uniformis L8 is a special degrader of AO in the gut microbiota. Because B. uniformis can mitigate high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders, further study is required to determine the potential applications of AO.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of the beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing secoisolariciresinol diglucoside to secoisolariciresinol from Bacteroides uniformis ZL1.
AB  - Previously, from the human intestinal flora we isolated the bacterial strain Bacteroides uniformis ZL1, which could convert secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) to its aglycone secoisolariciresinol (SECO) in vivo. In this study, 24 putative beta-glucosidase genes were screened from the genome of B. uniformis ATCC 8492, which were used as templates to design PCR primers for the target genes in B. uniformis ZL1. Fifteen genes (bgl1-bgl15) were amplified from strain ZL1, and among them we identified bgl8 as the gene encoding the SDG-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase. We sequenced the bgl8 gene, cloned it into the expression vector and then transformed Escherichia coli to construct the recombinant bacteria that could synthesize the target beta-glucosidase (BuBGL8). We purified and characterized BuBGL8, which showed maximal activity and stability under the culture conditions of pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C. SDG (2.0 mg/ml) was converted to SECO by both the purified BuBGL8 (0.035 mg/ml) and crude enzyme extract (0.23 mg crude protein/ml) with the efficiency of more than 90 % after 90 min at the reaction conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of using recombinant bacteria to synthesize the SDG-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase, which could be used to produce SECO from SDG conveniently and highly efficiently.
TI  - Analysis of a novel 8.9kb cryptic plasmid from Bacteroides uniformis, its long-term stability and spread within human microbiota.
AB  - The analysis of plasmid content in dominant Bacteroidales order intestinal strains isolated from the same child at a 5 year interval identified a 8.9 kb plasmid in Bacteroides uniformis BUN24 strain isolated at age 6 and indistinguishably sized plasmids in the isolates of B. uniformis, B. vulgatus, B. intesinalis, and Parabacteroides distasonis at age 11. We sequenced a B. uniformis BUN24 plasmid, designated pBUN24, and using molecular surveys of diverse species we established that this 8944bp molecule (G+C content 43.5%) represents a novel family of small cryptic Bacteroidales plasmids. The replication region of pBUN24 was experimentally localized to a 1707-bp fragment that includes a putative repA gene, coding for a protein of Rep_3 superfamily of replication proteins of theta-type plasmids preceded by a putative iteron-containing origin of replication. The other open reading frames (ORFs) identified in pBUN24 sequence include a putative tad-ata-type toxin-antitoxin and mobA-mobB mobilization modules, as well as seven additional cryptic ORFs. The interaction of Tad and Ada components demonstrated by a pull-down assay and the toxicity of Tad in Escherichia coli host suggests the functionality of the plasmid addiction module. Re-sequencing of plasmids in two Bacteroides strains isolated at the age of 11 showed 100% nucleotide identity to pBUN24. This data supports the notion that this plasmid is transmissible to other Bacteroidales strains in the natural ecosystem. The possible roles of toxin-antitoxin system and other proteins encoded by pBUN24 in providing an apparent ecological advantage to the plasmid-harbouring strains of a bacterial symbiont in the human gut deserve further investigation.
TI  - Mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The amplicons were then cloned into competent Escherichia coli cells. The clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. RESULTS: The clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. The microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. Of these, the most dominating were clones similar to Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides dorei within Bacteroidetes. Sequences similar to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium citroniae were also found in both patients. CONCLUSION: A predominance of potentially pathogenic Bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to Clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. Etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.
TI  - A new Bacteroides conjugative transposon that carries an ermB gene.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance gene ermB has been found in a variety of gram-positive bacteria. This gene has also been found in Bacteroides species but only in six recently isolated strains; thus, the gene seems to have entered this genus only recently. One of the six Bacteroides ermB-containing isolates, WH207, could transfer ermB to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain BT4001 by conjugation. WH207 was identified as a Bacteroides uniformis strain based on the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene. Results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated that the transferring element was normally integrated into the Bacteroides chromosome. The element was estimated from pulsed-field gel data to be about 100 kb in size. Since the element appeared to be a conjugative transposon (CTn), it was designated CTnBST. CTnBST was able to mobilize coresident plasmids and the circular form of the mobilizable transposon NBU1 to Bacteroides and Escherichia coli recipients. A 13-kb segment that contained ermB was cloned and sequenced. Most of the open reading frames in this region had little similarity at the amino acid sequence level to any proteins in the sequence databases, but a 1,723-bp DNA segment that included a 950-bp segment downstream of ermB had a DNA sequence that was virtually identical to that of a segment of DNA found previously in a Clostridium perfringens strain. This finding, together with the finding that ermB is located on a CTn, supports the hypothesis that CTnBST could have entered Bacteroides from some other genus, possibly from gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, this finding supports the hypothesis that many transmissible antibiotic resistance genes in Bacteroides are carried on CTns.
TI  - gyrA mutations associated with quinolone resistance in Bacteroides fragilis group strains.
AB  - Mutations in the gyrA gene contribute considerably to quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. Mechanisms for quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria are less well studied. The Bacteroides fragilis group are the anaerobic organisms most frequently isolated from patients with bacteremia and intraabdominal infections. Forty-four clinafloxacin-resistant and-susceptible fecal and clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group (eight Bacteroides fragilis, three Bacteroides ovatus, five Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, six Bacteroides uniformis, and 22 Bacteroides vulgatus) and six ATCC strains of the B. fragilis group were analyzed as follows: (i) determination of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin by the agar dilution method and (ii) sequencing of the gyrA quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) located between amino acid residues equivalent to Ala-67 through Gln-106 in E. coli. Amino acid substitutions were found at hotspots at positions 82 (n = 15) and 86 (n = 8). Strains with Ser82Leu substitutions (n = 13) were highly resistant to all quinolones tested. Mutations in other positions of gyrA were also frequently found in quinolone-resistant and -susceptible isolates. Eight clinical strains that lacked mutations in their QRDR were susceptible to at least two of the quinolones tested. Although newer quinolones have good antimicrobial activity against the B. fragilis group, quinolone resistance in B. fragilis strains can be readily selected in vivo. Mutational events in the QRDR of gyrA seem to contribute to quinolone resistance in Bacteroides species.
TI  - TLA-1: a new plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli R170, isolated from the urine of an infected patient, was resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin but was susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, and imipenem. This particular strain contained three different plasmids that encoded two beta-lactamases with pIs of 7.0 and 9.0. Resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was transferred by conjugation from E. coli R170 to E. coli J53-2. The transferred plasmid, RZA92, which encoded a single beta-lactamase, was 150 kb in length. The cefotaxime resistance gene that encodes the TLA-1 beta-lactamase (pI 9.0) was cloned from the transconjugant by transformation to E. coli DH5alpha. Sequencing of the bla(TLA-1) gene revealed an open reading frame of 906 bp, which corresponded to 301 amino acid residues, including motifs common to class A beta-lactamases: (70)SXXK, (130)SDN, and (234)KTG. The amino acid sequence of TLA-1 shared 50% identity with the CME-1 chromosomal class A beta-lactamase from Chryseobacterium (Flavobacterium) meningosepticum; 48.8% identity with the VEB-1 class A beta-lactamase from E. coli; 40 to 42% identity with CblA of Bacteroides uniformis, PER-1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and PER-2 of Salmonella typhimurium; and 39% identity with CepA of Bacteroides fragilis. The partially purified TLA-1 beta-lactamase had a molecular mass of 31.4 kDa and a pI of 9.0 and preferentially hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cephalothin, benzylpenicillin, and ceftazidime. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid. TLA-1 is a new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of Ambler class A.
TI  - Genetic-biochemical analysis and distribution of the Ambler class A beta-lactamase CME-2, responsible for extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in Chryseobacterium (Flavobacterium) meningosepticum.
AB  - In vitro synergy between extended-spectrum cephalosporins and either clavulanic acid or cefoxitin was found for Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates during a double-disk assay on an agar plate. An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene from a C. meningosepticum clinical isolate was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B. Its protein conferred resistance to most beta-lactams including extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not to cephamycins or to imipenem. Its activity was strongly inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, as well as by cephamycins and imipenem. Sequence analysis of the cloned DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 891 bp with a G+C content of 33.9%, which lies close to the expected range of G+C contents of members of the Chryseobacterium genus. The ORF encoded a precursor protein of 297 amino acids, giving a mature protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa and a pI value of 9.2 in E. coli. This gene was very likely chromosomally located. Amino acid sequence comparison showed that this beta-lactamase, named CME-2 (C. meningosepticum ESBL), is a novel ESBL of the Ambler class A group (Bush functional group 2be), being weakly related to other class A beta-lactamases. It shares only 39 and 35% identities with the ESBLs VEB-1 from E. coli MG-1 and CBL-A from Bacteroides uniformis, respectively. The distribution of bla(CME-2) among unrelated C. meningosepticum species isolates showed that bla(CME-2)-like genes were found in the C. meningosepticum strains studied but were absent from strains of other C. meningosepticum-related species. Each C. meningosepticum strain produced at least two beta-lactamases, with one of them being a noninducible serine ESBL with variable pIs ranging from 7.0 to 8.5.
TI  - Detection of Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by PCR.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. Enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. The enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in HT-29 cells. We developed a nested PCR to detect the enterotoxin gene of B. fragilis in stool specimens. After DNA extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. The amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal primers. With these inner primers, a 290-bp DNA fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the B. fragilis enterotoxin gene by Southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. By this approach, B. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. No amplification products were obtained from DNA extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic B. fragilis isolates or B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, B. ovatus, Escherichia coli, or Clostridium difficile. The sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin DNA sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis/g of stool. Enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in HT-29 cells. A 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested PCR assay. This rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of B. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.
TI  - Omeprazole induces altered bile acid metabolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the acidity of gastric contents could be an important factor in regulating jejunal flora. AIMS: To investigate the effects of omeprazole induced changes in gastric pH on jejunal flora and bile acid metabolism. METHODS: Twenty one patients with gastric ulcer and 19 healthy volunteers were studied. Deconjugation of bile acids was detected using a bile acid breath test. Jejunal fluid was aspirated using a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip and deconjugation was examined using thin layer chromatography. Fat malabsorption was detected by a triolein breath test. RESULTS: In the bile acid breath test, expired breath samples from all patients and healthy volunteers showed significantly greater 14CO2 specific activity after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) than before treatment. Bacterial overgrowth was found in the jejunal fluid and gastric juice of both ulcer patients and healthy volunteers after omeprazole treatment. The following species were identified: Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, enterococcus, Lactobacillus bifidus, Bacteroides vulgatus, B uniformis, Eubacterium lentum, Eu parvum, and Corynebacterium granulosum. All of these species, except E coli and C albicans, deconjugate bile acids. There was a significant correlation between 14CO2 activity and gastric pH, both before and after omeprazole treatment in both groups. The triolein breath test revealed impaired fat absorption in both groups after omeprazole treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both patients with gastric ulcer and healthy volunteers exhibited increased deconjugation of bile acids caused by bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum and fat malabsorption after omeprazole treatment. The bacterial over-growth consisted of both anaerobes and aerobes with deconjugation ability and was probably associated with an omeprazole induced shift to neutral pH in the gastric juice.
TI  - Alteration of bile acid metabolism by cimetidine in healthy humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To clarify an effect of cimetidine on bile acid metabolism, we evaluated whether an increased deconjugation of bile acids would occur in healthy humans who have received cimetidine. We examined: 1) whether healthy volunteers taking cimetidine would have positive bile acid breath tests because of bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum; 2) whether the isolated bacteria would exhibit deconjugation ability; and 3) whether a change in gastric pH was related to the bacterial overgrowth. METHODS: We evaluated 73 healthy Japanese volunteers; 53 of them received cimetidine and 20 did not. Deconjugation of bile acids was detected as 14CO2 specific activity of expired air measured by a bile acid breath test giving 5 muCi of oral glycine-1-(14)C labeled glycocholate. Aspiration of jejunal fluids was performed by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip, and deconjugation ability of bacteria was evaluated using thin layer chromotography. RESULTS: Samples of expired breath from the 53 healthy volunteers showed a significant increase in 14CO2 specific activity after the administration of cimetidine rather than before the administration of cimetidine. Bacterial over-growth was found in the jejunal fluid after the administration of cimetidine. The administration of tetracycline to 27 subjects significantly reduced the 14CO2 specific activity. The following species were identified in the jejunal fluid samples obtained from the subjects: enterococcus, Lactobacillus bifidus, Bacteroides vulgatus, B uniformis, Eubacterium lentum, E parvum, and Escherichia coli. Except for E coli, all of the bacterial species identified deconjugated bile acids. We observed a significant relationship between 14CO2's specific activity and gastric pH before and after administration of cimetidine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy volunteers who received cimetidine showed an increased deconjugation of bile acid caused by overgrowth of bacteria in the jejunum, which can deconjugate bile acids. The bacterial overgrowth is probably associated with a shift to neutral pH in the gastric juice caused by cimetidine.
TI  - Use of a modified Bacteroides-Prevotella shuttle vector to transfer a reconstructed beta-1,4-D-endoglucanase gene into Bacteroides uniformis and Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4.
AB  - A carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) gene from Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 was reconstructed by adding a cellulose binding domain from a Thermomonospora fusca cellulase and was conjugally transferred from Escherichia coli to Bacteroides uniformis 0061 by using a chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance shuttle vector (pTC-COW). pTC-COW was specifically constructed to facilitate conjugal transfer of vectors from B. uniformis donors to P. ruminicola recipients. B. uniformis transconjugants containing CMCase constructs cloned into pTC-COW expressed Cmr, but they did not produce the reconstructed CMCase until a xylanase promoter from P. ruminicola 23 was added upstream of the CMCase (pTC-XRCMC). The xylanase promoter allowed the B. uniformis transconjugants to produce large amounts of the reconstructed CMCase, which was present on the outside surface of the cells. Although the reconstructed CMCase alone did not allow B. uniformis to grow on acid-swollen cellulose, rapid growth was observed when two exocellulases were added to the culture supernatant. Under these conditions, the reconstructed CMCase permitted faster growth than the wild-type CMCase. The frequency of transfer of pTC-XRCMC from B. uniformis to P. ruminicola B(1)4 was increased 100-fold when strictly anaerobic conditions, nitrocelluose filters (cell immobilization), and more stringent selections were employed. Although the P. ruminicola B(1)4 (pTC-XRCMC) transconjugates expressed Tcr and had DNA that hybridized with a probe to the shuttle vector, these transconjugants did not produce detectable levels of the reconstructed CMCase even when xylan was the carbon source. On the basis of these results, it appears that not all of the promoters recognized by B. uniformis and P. ruminicola 23 are functional in P. ruminicola B(1)4. However, the results with B. uniformis suggest that the introduction of a P. ruminicola B(1)4 promoter should allow expression of the reconstructed CMCase in P. ruminicola B(1)4.
TI  - Bacteroides infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1990, 336 Bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. They comprised 180 (54%) B. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) B. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) B. vulgatus, 34 (10%) B. distasonis, 21 (6%) B. ovatus and 10 (3%) B. uniformis. Infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a Bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. Most Bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). Predisposing conditions were present in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). The micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with Bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), Escherichia coli (122), Fusobacterium spp. (38) and Clostridium spp. (30). All patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. All but 12 (5%) patients recovered. These data illustrate the importance of Bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Effect of H2-receptor antagonists on bile acid metabolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports have been presented concerning pronounced overgrowth  of bacteria in gastric juices of patients treated with H2-receptor antagonists. However, there has been no report concerning influence of H2-receptor antagonists on jejunal flora. Thus, to investigate the influence and its effect on bile acid metabolism, this study was performed: 1) to examine whether patients with gastric ulcers who have been treated with H2-receptor antagonists have positive bile acid breath tests due to bacterial overgrowth in their jejuna; 2) to verify that these bacteria, isolated and identified, have deconjugation ability; and 3) to determine whether the changes in the gastric pH are related to bacterial overgrowth. METHODS: The methods used were detection of deconjugation of bile acids in early phase by a bile acid breath test using 5 muCi of oral glycine-1-14C labeled glycocholate, aspiration of jejunal fluids by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip, and examination of deconjugation ability by thin layer chromatography. RESULTS: Expired breath samples from all 18 patients after administration of H2-receptor antagonists showed a significant increase in 14CO2 specific activity compared with those before administration of H2-receptor antagonist and the normal controls, and bacterial overgrowth was found in the jejunal fluid of the patients after administration of H2-receptor antagonist. The administration of tetracycline to the 18 patients reduced the 14CO2 specific activity significantly. The following species were identified in the jejunal fluid samples obtained from the patients: Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus, Lactobacillus bifidus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Eubacterium lentum, and Eubacterium parvum. All of the species identified except for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans deconjugated bile acids. There were significant correlations between the 14CO2 activity and gastric pH before and after administration of H2-receptor antagonist, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with gastric ulcers who were treated with H2-receptor antagonists have increased bile acid deconjugation due to bacterial overgrowth in their jejuna containing species that can deconjugate bile acids. The bacterial overgrowth is probably associated with a shift to neutral pH in the gastric juice caused by the H2-receptor antagonists.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Bacteroides fragilis YCH46 neuraminidase gene in Escherichia coli and Bacteroides uniformis.
AB  - A neuraminidase-encoding gene nanH of Bacteroides fragilis strain YCH46 was cloned into the cosmid vector pHC79. The nanH gene was subcloned from the cosmid and was located within a 2.2-kb XhoI-KpnI fragment. Southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the gene was present as a single copy on the bacterial chromosome. Neuraminidase activity expressed in the initial Escherichia coli clone was approximately 3600-fold lower than that expressed in B. fragilis YCH46. However, when nanH was transferred from E. coli to B. uniformis by mobilization of a shuttle plasmid, the transconjugant expressed 1100-fold higher activity than the E. coli donor did. These results suggest that modes of nanH expression in E. coli and Bacteroides are heterologous.
TI  - Molecular and genetic analysis of the Bacteroides uniformis cephalosporinase gene, cblA, encoding the species-specific beta-lactamase.
AB  - The gene, cblA, encoding the species-specific, clavulanate-susceptible, endogenous cephalosporinase was cloned from Bacteroides uniformis WAL-7088. The nucleotide sequence was determined, and the cblA structural gene was found to be 891 nucleotides, with a 48% G+C composition, which is similar to that of the B. uniformis genome. The cblA open reading frame encoded an Ambler class A beta-lactamase polypeptide precursor of 296 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 33,450. A beta-lactamase-deficient B. uniformis mutant with increased beta-lactam susceptibility was constructed by insertional inactivation of the chromosomal gene. This mutant was complemented by plasmids bearing the cblA gene, and the resulting strains were resistant to cephaloridine and had a beta-lactamase that comigrated with the parental beta-lactamase on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30,500 Da) and in isoelectric focusing gels (pI 4.6), confirming a role for this beta-lactamase in resistance.
TI  - Unexpected sequence similarity between nucleosidases and phosphoribosyltransferases of different specificity.
AB  - Amino acid sequences of enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis or phosphorolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in nucleosides and nucleotides (nucleosidases and phosphoribosyltransferases) were explored using computer methods for database similarity search and multiple alignment. Two new families, each including bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, were identified. Family I consists of Escherichia coli AMP hydrolase (Amn), uridine phosphorylase (Udp), purine phosphorylase (DeoD), uncharacterized proteins from E. coli and Bacteroides uniformis, and, unexpectedly, a group of plant stress-inducible proteins. It is hypothesized that these plant proteins have evolved from nucleosidases and may possess nucleosidase activity. The proteins in this new family contain 3 conserved motifs, one of which was found also in eukaryotic purine nucleosidases, where it corresponds to the nucleoside-binding site. Family II is comprised of bacterial and eukaryotic thymidine phosphorylases and anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferases, the relationship between which has not been suspected previously. Based on the known tertiary structure of E. coli thymidine phosphorylase, structural interpretation was given to the sequence conservation in this family. The highest conservation is observed in the N-terminal alpha-helical domain, whose exact function is not known. Parts of the conserved active site of thymidine phosphorylases and anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferases were delineated. A motif in the putative phosphate-binding site is conserved in family II and in other phosphoribosyltransferases. Our analysis suggests that certain enzymes of very similar specificity, e.g., uridine and thymidine phosphorylases, could have evolved independently. In contrast, enzymes catalyzing such different reactions as AMP hydrolysis and uridine phosphorolysis or thymidine phosphorolysis and phosphoribosyl anthranilate synthesis are likely to have evolved from common ancestors.
TI  - Transfer of hybrid plasmids based on the replicon pRRI7 from Escherichia coli to  Bacteroides and Prevotella strains.
AB  - New shuttle vectors based on a Prevotella ruminicola 9.5 kb cryptic plasmid (pRRI7) inserted within the Escherichia coli vector pKC71, carrying the Ccr/Emr Bacteroides marker, were constructed. These constructs (pKBR23-1 and pKBR23-2) were transferred into Bacteriodes distasonis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and into P. ruminicola NCFB 2202 either by conjugal mobilization or by electroporation. Another pRRI7 derivative based on pKC72, pKBR23-3, was smaller (13.1 kb) and non-mobilizable. By electroporation, it was transferred to Bact. distasonis and P. ruminicola. Being derived from pRRI7 which is compatible with the shuttle plasmid pRRI207, the host/vector combination involving P. ruminicola NCFB 2202 and pKBR23-3 offers new possibilities for genetic investigations in rumen anaerobic bacteria after further introduction of a second readily selectable marker within pRRI207 or pKBR23-3.
TI  - German multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of Bacteroides species. The German Bacteroides Study Group.
AB  - In 1990 the first German multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of Bacteroides species was completed. Employing a commercially prepared microbroth dilution assay, nine participating institutions evaluated approximately 100 consecutive isolates of Bacteroides species from relevant clinical specimens. A total of 911 strains (449 Bacteroides fragilis, 201 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 79 Bacteroides ovatus, 78 Bacteroides vulgatus, 77 Bacteroides distasonis, 25 Bacteroides uniformis, 2 others) were tested. Most of the isolates came from surgical patients (72%); other sources included gynaecological patients (9%) and medical patients (5%). Seventy-eight percent of the anaerobes were found in mixed culture together with at least one aerobic organism (Escherichia coli 36%, streptococci 15%, or enterococci 13%), while in 22% of the cases, the anaerobes were the only bacteria grown from the specimens. The results showed that many of the strains were potent beta-lactamase producers (as judged by resistance to amoxicillin). However, all but one of the isolates demonstrated susceptibility in vitro when clavulanic acid was added to amoxicillin or ticarcillin. At the same time, 13% of the organisms were resistant to mezlocillin, 5% to cefoxitin and 4% to clindamycin. Three strains were reported resistant to imipenem and one strain to metronidazole.
TI  - Transposition of Tn4351 in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Genetic analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an obligately anaerobic gram-negative bacterium, has been hindered by the apparent lack of naturally occurring bacteriophages, transposable elements, and plasmids. Plasmid R751::*omega 4 has previously been used as a suicide vector to demonstrate transposition of Tn4351 in B. uniformis. The erythromycin resistance gene on Tn4351 functions in Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. Erythromycin-resistant transconjugants were obtained at a mean frequency of 1.6 x 10(-7) from matings between Escherichia coli HB101 containing R751::*omega 4 and P. gingivalis 33277. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated that about half of the erythromycin-resistant P. gingivalis transconjugants contained simple insertions of Tn4351 and half contained both Tn4351 and R751 sequences. The presence of R751 sequences in some P. gingivalis transconjugants most likely occurred from Tn4351-mediated cointegration of R751, since we were unable to detect autonomous plasmid in these P. gingivalis transconjugants. The P. gingivalis-Tn4351 DNA junction fragments from different transconjugants varied in size. These results are consistent with transposition of Tn4351 and with insertion at several different locations in the P. gingivalis chromosome. Tn4351 may be useful as a mutagen to isolate well-defined mutants of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of a shuttle vector from the human colonic anaerobe Bacteroides uniformis to the ruminal anaerobe Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola B(1)4.
AB  - Prevotella ruminicola (formerly Bacteroides ruminicola) is an anaerobic, gram-negative, polysaccharide-degrading bacterium which is found in the rumina of cattle. Since P. ruminicola is thought to make an important contribution to digestion of plant material in rumina, the ability to alter this strain genetically might help improve the efficiency of rumen fermentation. However, previously there has been no way to introduce foreign DNA into P. ruminicola strains. In this study we transferred a shuttle vector, pRDB5, from the colonic species Bacteroides uniformis to P. ruminicola B(1)4. The transfer frequency was 10(-6) to 10(-7) per recipient. pRDB5 contains sequences from pBR328, a cryptic colonic Bacteroides plasmid pB8-51, and a colonic Bacteroides tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene. pRDB5 was mobilized out of B. uniformis by a self-transmissible Bacteroides chromosomal element designated Tcr Emr 12256. pRDB5 replicated in Escherichia coli as well as in Bacteroides spp. and was also mobilized from E. coli to B. uniformis by using IncP plasmid R751. However, direct transfer from E. coli to P. ruminicola B(1)4 was not detected. Thus, to introduce cloned DNA into P. ruminicola B(1)4, it was necessary first to mobilize the plasmid from E. coli to B. uniformis and then to mobilize the plasmid from B. uniformis to P. ruminicola B(1)4.
TI  - Role of Bacteroides uniformis in susceptibility of Ta:CF# 1 mice to infection by  Treponema hyodysenteriae.
AB  - Among the various strains and colonies of mice tested specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Ta:CF#1 mice exhibited the highest susceptibility to Treponema hyodysenteriae infection. Staphylococcus epidermidis 1047, Streptococcus faecalis 2039, Lactobacillus murinus 3010, Escherichia coli 1049, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3008 were administered to the Ta:CF#1 mice. B. uniformis IK, which appeared to colonize in the breeding facility under SPF conditions, was isolated from the cecal content of a Ta:CF#1 mouse and identified in the mouse flora. Germfree mice were infected with these six bacteria and challenged with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 to elucidate the causal relationship between these bacteria and the sensitivity of mice to T. hyodysenteriae infection. No cecal lesions were observed in gnotobiotic mice either monoassociated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 or B. uniformis IK or inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with the 5 a.m. strains. Gross cecal lesions appeared only in mice inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with B. uniformis IK. A new SPF mouse colony (CF#1/b Ta) established from gnotobiotic mice by inoculation with B. uniformis IK and the 5 laboratory stock cultures was as susceptible to T. hyodysenteriae as the original Ta:CF#1 mice. This suggests that B. uniformis IK plays an important role in the high susceptibility of Ta:CF#1 mice to T.hyodysenteriae.
TI  - Plasmid transformation of Bacteroides spp. by electroporation.
AB  - Transformation of Bacteroides spp. with a variety of plasmid DNAs was accomplished using electroporation. The standard transformation assay system used to deduce the optimal electroporation parameters employed a 50-to 100-fold concentrated cell suspension of mid-logarithmic phase Bacteroides fragilis strain 638 and the 5.4-kb clindamycin resistance (Ccr) vector, pBI191. A variety of electroporation buffers were used successfully in transformation experiments but of these, 1 mM MgCl2 in 10% glycerol was superior. The incorporation of MgCl2 was essential for optimum viability prior to electroporation and for optimum transformation. Transformants were routinely obtained using 5-ms pulses over a range of field strengths from 5 to 12.5 kV/cm, with a maximum of greater than 10(6) micrograms-1 DNA at 12.5 kV/cm. The number of transformants increased linearly with respect to DNA concentration over the range 0.01-2 micrograms tested. Recovery of transformants required an expression period of up to 2.5 h following exposure to the electric field. This period, however, was dependent on the antibiotic resistance marker used for selection of transformants, with a significantly shorter incubation required when chloramphenicol rather than clindamycin was used in the selective medium. The effect of the DNA source on transformation was tested using the shuttle vector pFD288. Plasmid DNA isolated from Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron transformed B. fragilis 638 at frequencies 7.5- to 12.5-fold less than those observed for controls with homologous DNA. Further reductions were seen with Escherichia coli purified pFD288, which transformed at 1000-fold lower frequencies. Finally, using homologous pFD288 or pBI191 isolated from strain 638, several strains of B. fragilis, B. uniformis, and B. ovatus were transformed successfully without modification of the standard assay system. Two strains each of B. thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ruminicola were not transformed using the methods described here.
TI  - The region of a Bacteroides conjugal chromosomal tetracycline resistance element  which is responsible for production of plasmidlike forms from unlinked chromosomal DNA might also be involved in transfer of the element.
AB  - Large (greater than 50 kilobases) conjugal chromosomal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements have been found in many human colonic Bacteroides strains. Recently, N. B. Shoemaker and A. A. Salyers (J. Bacteriol, 170:1651-1657, 1988) reported that some of these Tcr elements appeared to mediate production of plasmidlike forms, NBU1 and NBU2, from an unlinked region of the chromosome of Bacteroides uniformis 0061. Production of the plasmidlike forms and the transfer frequency of the Tcr elements were both enhanced by preexposure to tetracycline. Thus it appeared that genes involved in production of plasmidlike forms (Plf activity) might be coregulated with transfer genes and that Plf activity might have a role in transfer of the Tcr elements. By screening subclones of a Tcr element, Tcr Emr DOT, we have shown that the genes necessary for Plf activity on the Tcr element are within a 10-kilobase region adjacent to the Tcr gene. Subclones of this region were then used to construct insertional gene disruptions in a Tcr element, Tcr ERL, which is closely related to the Tcr Emr DOT element. Two of the disruption mutants were Plf-. Both had reduced transfer frequencies, one (omega RDB2) 10(2)-fold lower than that of the wild-type element and the other (omega RDBT) 10(4)-fold lower. omega RDB2 was also deficient in the ability to mobilize coresident plasmids, whereas omega RDBT exhibited nearly wild-type mobilization activity. The phenotypes of the mutants indicate that there are at least two genes necessary for Plf activity and that both may be involved in transfer of the element. The third disruption mutant (omegaRDB1), which expressed Plf constitutively, also had a transfer frequency 10(2) -fold lower than that of the wild-type element and was deficient in mobilization of coresident plasmids. The relationship between Plf genes and transfer, therefore, appears to be a complex one.
TI  - A cryptic 65-kilobase-pair transposonlike element isolated from Bacteroides uniformis has homology with Bacteroides conjugal tetracycline resistance elements.
AB  - A 65-kilobase-pair element, XBU4422, which has some transposonlike characteristics but carries no known antibiotic resistance genes, has been isolated from Bacteroides uniformis 0061. XBU4422 was trapped on Bacteroides-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors during experiments in which one of the conjugal Bacteroides tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements was being used to mobilize the shuttle vectors to Bacteroides recipients. Results of Southern hybridization experiments showed that XBU4422 is normally integrated in the B. uniformis 0061 chromosome and is found only in some strains. Insertion of XBU4422 in the shuttle vectors was site specific and orientation specific. Nonmobilizable vectors that had acquired XBU4422 became transmissible and could be transferred to Bacteroides or E. coli recipients. In B. uniformis transconjugants, the XBU4422 insertion in the vectors was usually intact, but XBU4422 was always lost in matings with E. coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, or B. ovatus. The loss of XBU4422 did not visibly alter the vector; in the case of E. coli, the loss of the insertion appeared to be RecA dependent. Although XBU4422 carried no antibiotic resistances, it shared regions of homology with six conjugal Bacteroides Tcr elements; this homology was strongest with the ends of XBU4422. Using a strain of B. thetaiotaomicron that contains no XBU4422-hybridizing sequences, we showed that the ends of XBU4422 were probably reacting with the ends of the Tcr elements. These results provide the first direct evidence that the Tcr elements, like XBU4422, are integrated in the chromosome and that insertion of the least some Tcr elements, such as TcrEmr DOT, is relatively site specific.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the Bacteroides ruminicola xylanase gene in Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis.
AB  - A cloned xylanase gene from the ruminal bacterium Bacteroides ruminicola 23 was transferred by conjugation into the colonic species Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides uniformis by using the Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector pVAL-1. The cloned gene was expressed in both species, and xylanase specific activity in crude extracts was found to be at least 1400-fold greater than that found in the B. ruminicola strain. Analysis of crude extract proteins from the recombinant B. fragilis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated a new 60,000 molecular weight protein. The xylanase activity expressed in both E. coli and B. fragilis was capable of degrading xylan to xylooligosaccharides in vitro. This is the first demonstration that colonic Bacteroides species can express a gene from a ruminal Bacteroides species.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a Bacteroides conjugal tetracycline-erythromycin  resistance element by using a shuttle cosmid vector.
AB  - The Bacteroides conjugal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements appear not to be  plasmids. In many cases, resistance to erythromycin (Emr) is cotransferred with Tcr. Using a newly constructed shuttle cosmid, pNJR1, we cloned 44 to 50 kilobase pairs of a conjugal Tcr Emr element on overlapping cosmid clones. Cosmid libraries were made in Escherichia coli with DNA from the original clinical Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron DOT strain containing Tcr Emr-DOT or from a Bacteroides uniformis Tcr Emr-DOT transconjugant strain. The cosmid clones were mobilized from E. coli into B. uniformis in groups of 10 to 20 per filter mating, with selection for Tcr or Emr transconjugants. The Tcr and Emr genes were cloned both separately and together on 30-kilobase-pair fragments. Several of the Tcr clones also contained transfer genes that permitted self-transfer of the cosmid from B. uniformis donors to E. coli or B. uniformis recipients. Neither the Tcr nor the Emr gene conferred resistance on E. coli, and the transfer-proficient clones did not self-transfer out of E. coli. Southern blot analysis was used to compare DNA from independently isolated Bacteroides strains carrying conjugal Tcr or Tcr Emr elements and their respective B. uniformis transconjugants. Results of these analyses indicate that there are large regions of homology, including regions outside the Tcr and Emr genes, but that the elements are not identical. Some Tcr clones contained a region which hybridized to chromosomal DNA from the wild-type B. uniformis recipient strain that did not carry the Tcr Emr-DOT element. This region of homology appeared not to be a junction fragment. It was not required in a Bacteroides recipient for successful transfer of the Tcr Emr element. Although we are not sure we have cloned a junction fragment between the Tcr Emr-DOT element and the B. uniformis chromosome, the preliminary function and restriction map appears to be linear.
TI  - Mobilization of Bacteroides plasmids by Bacteroides conjugal elements.
AB  - A 4.2-kilobase cryptic Bacteroides plasmid, pB8-51, is found in several colonic Bacteroides species. To determine whether pB8-51 is mobilized by any of the known Bacteroides conjugal elements, we constructed an Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector, pVAL-1, which contains pB8-51. We constructed Bacteroides uniformis 0061 derivatives which carry pVAL-1 and various Bacteroides conjugal elements. The Bacteroides conjugal elements tested were six conjugal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements (which appear to be chromosomal), i.e., Tcr ERL, Tcr V479, Tcr Emr ERL, Tcr Emr 12256, Tcr Emr DOT, and Tcr Emr CEST, and the conjugal erythromycin resistance (Emr) plasmid pBF4. These Tcr conjugal elements have not been extensively characterized, except for Tcr ERL. All six Tcr elements tested mobilized pVAL-1 at high frequency (10(-3) to 10(-5)) from one Bacteroides strain to another or from a Bacteroides strain to E. coli. Pregrowth of the donors (containing one of the Tcr elements and pVAL-1) in 1 microgram of tetracycline per ml enhanced the transfer of pVAL-1 by 20- to 10,000-fold, depending on which Tcr element was present in the donor. An Ems derivative of pBF4 (pBF4 delta E2) mobilized pVAL-1 from one Bacteroides strain to another at a frequency of 10(-4) but did not mobilize pVAL-1 from a Bacteroides strain to E. coli as efficiently. Thus the Tcr conjugal elements and pBF4 recognize a mobilization region on pB8-51.
TI  - Facilitated transfer of IncP beta R751 derivatives from the chromosome of Bacteroides uniformis to Escherichia coli recipients by a conjugative Bacteroides tetracycline resistance element.
AB  - The broad-host-range IncP beta plasmid R751 can mobilize itself from Escherichia  coli to Bacteroides spp, but it is not maintained in Bacteroides spp. If R751 carries the Bacteroides transposon Tn4351, it can be integrated into the Bacteroides chromosome. Previously we showed that R751, integrated in the chromosome of Bacteroides uniformis, cannot mobilize itself out of B. uniformis into E. coli or isogenic B. uniformis strains. In this report, we showed that if the Bacteroides conjugative tetracycline resistance element Tcr ERL was coresident with the R751 insertion in B. uniformis, derivatives of R751 were transferred to E. coli, where they were recovered as plasmids. The most common derivatives were R751::Tn4351 and R751::IS4351, but some strains transferred R751 derivatives, containing additional DNA segments ranging in size from 10 to 23 kilobases. These DNA inserts cross-hybridized with chromosomal DNA from B. uniformis which did not carry the Tcr ERL element. Therefore, the inserts appeared to be segments of the wild-type B. uniformis chromosome and were not associated with the Tcr ERL element. The transfer of integrated R751 from B. uniformis was independent of the RecA phenotype of the E. coli recipients and did not appear to be due to transfer of B. uniformis chromosomal DNA, followed by RecA-dependent recombination between homologous IS4351 sequences to form the resultant R751 plasmid derivatives. Consistent with this, no transfer of Tn4351 (associated with the cointegrated R751) from B. uniformis donors to isogenic B. uniformis recipients was detected (< 10(-8)). Our data support the hypothesis that R751 excises from the B. uniformis chromosome by recombination involving flanking Tn4351 or IS4351 sequences and forms nonreplicating circles. The mobilization of these circular forms out of B. uniformis to E.coli is then facilitated by the Tcr ERL element.
TI  - Regions in Bacteroides plasmids pBFTM10 and pB8-51 that allow Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vectors to be mobilized by IncP plasmids and by a conjugative Bacteroides tetracycline resistance element.
AB  - Bacteroides-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors containing a nonmobilizable pBR322 derivative and either pBFTM10 (pDP1, pCG30) or pB8-51 (pEG920) were mobilized by IncP plasmid R751 or pRK231 (an ampicillin-sensitive derivative of RK2) between E. coli strains and from E. coli to Bacteroides recipients. IncI alpha R64 drd-ll transferred these vectors 1,000 times less efficiently than did the IncP plasmids. pDP1, pCG30, and pEG920 could be mobilized from B. uniformis donors to both E. coli and Bacteroides recipients by a conjugative Bacteroides Tcr (Tcr ERL) element which was originally found in a clinical Bacteroides fragilis strain (B. fragilis ERL). However, the shuttle vector pE5-2, which contains pB8-51 cloned in a restriction site that prevents its mobilization by IncP or IncI alpha plasmids, also was not mobilized at detectable frequencies from Bacteroides donors by the Tcr ERL element. The mobilization frequencies of pCG30, pDP1, and pEG920 by the Tcr ERL element in B. uniformis donors to E. coli recipients was about the same as those to isogenic B. uniformis recipients. Transfer of the shuttle vectors from B. uniformis donors to E. coli occurred at the same frequencies when the matings were done aerobically or anaerobically. Growth of the B. uniformis donors in tetracycline (1 microgram/ml) prior to conjugation increased the mobilization frequencies of the vectors to both E. coli and Bacteroides recipients 50 to 100 times.
TI  - Tn4351 transposes in Bacteroides spp. and mediates the integration of plasmid R751 into the Bacteroides chromosome.
AB  - The gene for resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, which is carried on the  conjugative Bacteroides plasmid, pBF4, has been shown previously to be part of an element (Tn4351) that transposes in Escherichia coli. We have now introduced Tn4351 into Bacteroides uniformis 0061 on the following two suicide vectors: (i) the broad-host-range IncP plasmid R751 (R751::Tn4351) and (ii) pSS-2, a chimeric plasmid which contains 33 kilobases of pBF4 (including Tn4351) cloned into the IncQ plasmid RSF1010 and which is mobilized by R751. When E. coli HB101, carrying either R751::Tn4351 or R751 and pSS-2, was mated with B. uniformis under aerobic conditions, Emr transconjugants were detected at a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-5) (R751::Tn4351) or 10(-8) to 10(-6) (R751 and pSS-2). In matings involving pSS-2, all Emr transconjugants contained simple insertions of Tn4351 in the chromosome, whereas in matings involving R751::Tn4351, about half of the Emr transconjugants had R751 cointegrated with Tn4351 in the chromosome. Of the Emr transconjugants, 13% were auxotrophs. Bacteroides spp. which had R751 cointegrated with Tn4351 in the chromosome did not transfer R751 or Tn4351 to E. coli HB101 or to isogenic B. uniformis, nor did the intergrated R751 mobilize pE5-2, an E. coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector that contains a transfer origin that is recognized by R751.
TI  - Transferable plasmid-linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase conferring high-level resistance in Bacteroides uniformis.
AB  - Bacteroides uniformis RYC3373 resistant to 64 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml was isolated from a peritoneal pelvic abscess of a patient not previously treated with this drug. Chloramphenicol resistance was transferable at low frequency to a suitable Bacteroides fragilis recipient. The acquisition of resistance was linked to the presence of a 39.5-kilobase plasmid (pRYC3373), which was subsequently transferred to a secondary recipient. The transfer of Cm resistance occurred by a conjugation-like process. Donor and transconjugant strains produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constitutively. The Km for chloramphenicol was 40 microM, and its inactivation by 5-5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) suggested its similarity to the type II enterobacterial enzymes encoded by different conjugative plasmids and also to a previously described enzyme of B. fragilis F47 and F48. The specific activity and the resistance level in pRYC3373-bearing strains were more than 10-fold higher than in the case of the enzyme from B. fragilis strains F47 and F48. The genetic basis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis in Bacteroides spp. had not been previously established.
TI  - Evidence that the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance gene of Bacteroides plasmid pBF4 is on a transposable element.
AB  - We constructed a shuttle vector, pE5-2, which can replicate in both Bacteroides spp. and Escherichia coli. pE5-2 contains a cryptic Bacteroides plasmid (pB8-51), a 3.8-kilobase (kb) EcoRI-D fragment from the 41-kb Bacteroides fragilis plasmid pBF4, and RSF1010, an IncQ E. coli plasmid. pE5-2 was mobilized by R751, an IncP E. coli plasmid, between E. coli strains with a frequency of 5 X 10(-2) to 3.8 X 10(-1) transconjugants per recipient. R751 also mobilized pE5-2 from E. coli donors to Bacteroides uniformis 0061RT and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482 with a frequency of 0.9 X 10(-6) to 2.5 X 10(-6). The Bacteroides transconjugants contained only pE5-2 and were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. Thus, the gene for clindamycin and erythromycin resistance must be located within the Eco RI-D fragment of BF4. A second recombinant plasmid, pSS-2, which contained 33 kb of pBF4 (including the EcoRI-D fragment and contiguous regions) could also be mobilized by R751 between E. coli strains. In some transconjugants, a 5.5-kb (+/- 0.3 kb) segment of the pBF4 portion of pSS2 was inserted into one of several sites on R751. In some other transconjugants this same 5.5-kb segment was integrated into the E. coli chromosome. This segment could transfer a second time onto R751. Transfer was RecA independent. The transferred segment included the entire EcoRI-D fragment, and thus the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance determinant, from pBF4.
TI  - Specific strains of Bacteroides species in human fecal flora as measured by deoxyribonucleic acid homology.
AB  - Membrane competition homology experiments were used to compare Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus isolates obtained from fecal samples from different individuals and isolates obtained from fecal samples of single individuals. Isolates of B. uniformis, when isolated from different individuals, had interstrain deoxyribonucleic acid homology values that ranged from 63 to 95%, with most of the values being in the 70 to 85% range. When isolates obtained from a single individual were compared, each species was represented by one or two groups of very closely related organisms, with each group having essentially 100% interstrain homology. When strains from two groups were compared with each other, the homology values were in the same range as when organisms were isolated from different individuals. Isolates which have nearly 100% homology with each other persisted in fecal samples collected over a 5- to 6-month period. It appears that the colon of each person may be populated by bacterial strains that are specific for that individual. Somatic antigen serotyping has been used as an indicator for specific Escherichia coli strains in fecal samples. Two isolates having the same O, K, and H antigens had 99% homology, but when only O and H antigens were in common, the homology values were in the 70 to 85% range. It seems that isolates of a given serotype, when isolated from a single individual, may represent a unique strain, but isolates of a given serotype, when isolated from different individuals, probably do not.
TI  - Fecal bacteria in South African rural blacks and other population groups.
AB  - Quantitative studies were performed on fecal flora of three population groups consuming different diets. Twenty rural black South Africans and 22 Japanese, representing groups at low risk for carcinoma of the colon, were compared with 41 North Americans from a high-risk population. Specimens taken immediately after defecation were mixed and processed under anaerobic conditions. After the initial incubation, roll tubes were shipped to the United States for final identification. Bacterioides and bifidobacteria were present in lower numbers in South African subjects, as were Bacteroides uniformis (thought to be increased by conditions of fear and anger stress), compared with the other two groups. The number of B. vulgatus and B. distasonis and the "Peptostreptococcus productus species complex," showed a positive correlation with the risk of colon cancer, while an inverse relationship was found with Eubacterium aerofaciens II, B. fragilis and Escherichia coli. The percentage of fecal isolates stimulated by bile was slightly higher in populations with a high fat intake and a high risk of cancer of the colon.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
