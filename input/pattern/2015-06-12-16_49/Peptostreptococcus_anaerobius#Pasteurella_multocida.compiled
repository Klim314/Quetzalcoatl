TI  - The obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  - Samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. All mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. A mixed growth was obtained from all samples. The mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. Of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. Of the facultatively anaerobic species, Actinomyces (including A. viscosus, A. hordeovulneris and A. denticolens) comprised 12%, Pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and Propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. Clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates, Wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was C. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was P. multocida. These findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.
TI  - Bacteriology of periodontal disease in the cat.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. Correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. The tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The most common organism was an anaerobic Gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented Bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to B. gingivalis but had catalase activity. The black-pigmented Bacteroides group and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.
TI  - Microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of Iran.
AB  - A total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. A total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. Microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus and Pasteurella, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium tortuosum were isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. Two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. It was determined that 11 isolates of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of P multocida, and 1 of C pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. Two of the C pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. As determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. In nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with C pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. Postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly Przhevalskiana silenus at the site of infection.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of bacteria from abscesses in the subcutis of cats.
AB  - Thirty-six closed abcesses in the subcutis of cats were examined. Of 168 bacterial strains isolated, 121(72%) were anaerobes and 47 (28%) were facultative anaerobes. Twenty-six abscesses contained mixtures of facultative anaerobes and anaerobes, six contained anaerobes only and four contained facultative anaerobes only. Bacteriodes was the genus most commonly isolated (28.6% of all isolates) followed by Fusobacterium (19.0%) and Pasteurella (multocida) (13.1%). Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was the most commonly isolated anaerobic species (13.2% of anaerobic isolates and 9.5% of all isolates)and Past, multocida was the most commonly isolated facultative anaerobe (46.8%; 13.1%of all isolates).
