TI  == first functional and mutational analysis of group 3 n-acetylneuraminate lyases from lactobacillus antri and lactobacillus sakei 23k.
AB  == n-acetyl neuraminate lyases (nals) catalyze the reversible aldol cleavage of n-acetyl neuraminic acid (neu5ac) to pyruvate and n-acetyl-d-mannosamine (mannac). previous phylogenetic studies divided nals into four different groups.  groups 1 and 2 have been well characterized at both kinetic and molecular levels, but no nal from group 3 has been studied to date. in this work, a functional characterization of two group 3 members was performed using the recombinant nals  from lactobacillus antri and lactobacillus sakei 23k, revealing an optimal ph of  between 6.0 and 7.0, low stability at basic phs (>8.0), low optimal temperatures  and, especially, low catalytic efficiency compared with their counterparts in group 1 and 2. the mutational analysis carried out showed that a plausible molecular reason for the low activity shown by lactobacillus antri and lactobacillus sakei 23k nals compared with group 1 and 2 nals could be the relatively small sugar-binding pocket they contain. a functional divergence analysis concluding that group 3 is more closely related to group 2 than to group 1.
