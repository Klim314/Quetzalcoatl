TI  == [etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the cardiovascular surgery clinic of iasi].
AB  == aim: we want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. the study focuses on patients with  vap post-cardiac surgery at the institute of cardiovascular surgery between april 2nd 2002 and august 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after june 14th, 2005. material and methods: the tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). the isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 cfu/ml) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with  the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. results: among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with vap through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. the 9 most common pathogens in vap etiology were pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, candida albicans 9.53%, while klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. acinetobacter baumannii and s.maltophilia appear starting with june 15th, 2005. from that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (mdr) 46.86%. the mdr phenotype was more frequent at a.baumannii (15.62%), s. maltophilia (15.62%) and p. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to k .pneumoniae (3.12%) or e. coli (0%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. conclusions: the most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and candida albicans. the large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant

TI  == corynebacterium prosthetic joint infection.
AB  == identification of corynebacterium species may be challenging. corynebacterium species are occasional causes of prosthetic joint infection (pji), but few data are available on the subject. based on the literature, c. amycolatum, c. aurimucosum, c. jeikeium, and c. striatum are the most common corynebacterium species that cause pji. we designed a rapid pcr assay to detect the most common human corynebacterium species, with a specific focus on pji. a polyphosphate kinase gene identified using whole-genome sequence was targeted. the assay differentiates the antibiotic-resistant species c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum from other species in a single assay. the assay was applied to a collection of human corynebacterium isolates from multiple clinical sources, and clinically relevant species were detected. the assay was then tested on corynebacterium isolates specifically associated with pji; all were detected. we also describe the first case of c. simulans pji.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == [wound infections due to opportunistic corynebacterium species].
AB  == wound infections are often due to endogenous bacterial flora which penetrates into a site of injury. the establishment of the etiologic agent can be problematic, especially when opportunistic bacteria are present, suggesting contamination of clinical material. among bacteria that can cause such diagnostic problems are opportunistic corynebacterium spp. and coryneforms colonizing skin.  the aim of the study was to analyze the 24 clinical samples collected from wounds of different location, with gram positive rods isolated in numbers suggesting the cause of infection. bacterial identification was performed by api coryne and additional biochemical tests (api zym, api ne). it was detected that the commonest species isolated were: c. amycolatum (29.2%), c. striatum (16.7%), c. group g (16.7%) and brevibacterium spp., c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. group f1. the drug susceptibility testing was performed by e-test method. among isolated strains, 83.3% were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. in 75% cases resistance to co-trimoxazole was noted, in 71.7% resistance to chloramphenicol and in 16.7% resistance to beta-lactams were detected. in presented study the high percentage of strains resistant to macrolids and linkosamids (mlsb) was noted. all strains were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == high frequency of macrolide resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of corynebacterium species.
AB  == the genus corynebacterium includes a high number of species that are usually isolated from human skin as saprophytes. however, these microorganisms have also  been reported as infectious agents in a broad group of patients and have showed broad-spectrum resistance. we studied the susceptibility profiles against macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins of 254 clinical strains belonging to  the species corynebacterium urealyticum (120), corynebacterium amycolatum (66), corynebacterium jeikeium (17), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium coyleae (12), corynebacterium aurimucosum (11), and corynebacterium afermentans subsp. afermentans (8). the mls(b) phenotype was detected in 186 strains and was  associated with the presence of methylase enzymes codified by the erm(x) gene in  171 strains. the erm(b) gene was only detected in two c. urealyticum strains. fourteen strains showed macrolide resistance, but they did not carry erm genes. mef genes were not detected despite eight c. amycolatum strains showed the m phenotype. also, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes codified by ere(b) was evaluated, but all results were negative. resistance to macrolide in corynebacterium sp. is mainly due to the presence of erm(x) methylase, although other resistance mechanisms could be involved.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria isolated from the reproductive tract of women].
AB  == the species composition, antilysozyme activity and antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria, isolated from the reproductive tract of women with microecological disturbances, were studied. sixty six women without microecological disturbances and 102 female patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract were examined. the study showed that corynebacterium minutissimum, c. amycolatum, c. group jk, c. bovis and c. pseudodiphtheriticum prevailed in the healthy women. in the patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract c. vitarumen, c. matruchotii, c. striatum, c. renale and c. urealyticum were detected in addition  to the above species. the average antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria isolated from the healthy women was 1.32 +/- 0.47. in the patients with  microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract it was 1.84 +/- 0.38. the  in vitro susceptibility of the coryneform bacteria to antimicrobial agents was determined. high prevalence of resistance to beta-lactams (oxacillin and penicillin), erythromycin and co-trimoxazole was detected. thus, the species variety and the antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria in the reproductive tract of the women with microecological disturbances were found to be higher. the high prevalence of resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole in the coryneform bacteria isolated from the patients with the microecological disturbances did not differ from that in the healthy women.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other antimicrobials against clinical isolates of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == we studied the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other commonly used antibiotics against 135 clinical isolates of non-diphtheria corynebacterium spp.  using the etest system. tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms (mic(50) and mic(90) values, respectively, in mg/l) were: corynebacterium urealyticum, 0.094 and 0.125; corynebacterium amycolatum, 0.125 and 2; corynebacterium jeikeium, 0.094 and 0.75; corynebacterium coyleae, 0.064 and 0.064; corynebacterium striatum, 0.064 and 1; corynebacterium aurimucosum, 0.094 and 0.125; and corynebacterium afermentans, 0.064 and 0.094. the activities of all other antimicrobials were variable, with good activity of glycopeptides, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin and with resistance to macrolides in a high number of isolates. tigecycline is a good alternative for the therapy of infections caused by non-diphtheria corynebacteria.

TI  == infections caused by coryneform bacteria in pediatric oncology patients.
AB  == background: invasive infections caused by coryneform bacteria are uncommon but have been reported with increasing frequency in recent decades, especially in immunocompromised persons. because pediatric experience is limited, we examined the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of these infections in children undergoing cancer therapy. methods: using strict case definitions, 17 coryneform  bacterial infections were identified in 16 children during a 13-year period; there were 12 episodes of bacteremia and 5 skin or soft tissue infections. results: the median age of children with bloodstream infections was 11.2 years, and that of children with skin or soft tissue infections was 3.5 years. most were receiving cancer therapy at the time of their infections, were outpatients at the onset of their infections, had central venous catheters, and were not neutropenic. no patient died as a result of infection and most had relatively mild signs and symptoms. all patients responded promptly to antimicrobial therapy and, although 3 infections relapsed, there was only 1 serious complication. the most common species isolated were corynebacterium striatum, c. amycolatum, and microbacterium species. conclusions: the epidemiologic and clinical features of coryneform bacterial infections in immunocompromised children differ in several important respects from the previously reported characteristics of these infections in adults.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and 12 other antimicrobials against coryneform bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to compare the in vitro activity of linezolid with 12 other antimicrobials against 190 strains of the coryneform bacteria, including 60 strains of c. amycolatum, 30 of c. striatum, 30 of c. jeikeium, 10 of c. urealyticum, 20 of b. casei, 20 of d. hominis and 20 of t. otitidis. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and time-death curves were carried out according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). results: linezolid was very active against the 130 strains of the corynebacterium species studied. only the glycopeptides showed similar efficacy. in contrast, penicillin g, ampicillin, macrolides, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides showed generally high mics. among the beta-lactams, only imipenem was active against the majority of strains of c. striatum and c. amycolatum, and, approximately half of the c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum isolates. both dermabacter hominis and brevibacterium casei showed marked resistance against most of the antimicrobials tested, while turicella otitidis only showed high mics against macrolides and clindamycin. for all of them, linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin proved effective. the time-death curves showed linezolid to behave as a bacteriostatic agent (approximately 90% death rate). such activity was more accentuated for c. amycolatum and c. striatum (reduction of 1.3 and 1.7log(10)cfu/ml, respectively) than for c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum (reduction of 1.0 and 0.8log(10), respectively). conclusions: our results indicate that linezolid is active against coryneform bacteria. the efficacy of linezolid is equal to or even superior to that of the glycopeptides.

TI  == [evaluation of api coryne system, version 2.0, for diphteroid gram-positive rods  identification with clinical relevance].
AB  == the ability of the api coryne system, version 2.0, to identify 178 strains of gram-positive rods was evaluated. seventy eight isolates belonged to genus corynebacterium and one hundred to related genera, all strains were isolated from clinical samples at the laboratory of bacteriology, hospital de clinicas jose de  san martin (uba) between 1995 and 2004. the isolates were identified according to von graevenitz and funke's scheme. one hundred and sixty two out of 178 strains (91%) were correctly identified at genus and species level (ic95 = 85.6-94.6), in 44 of them (24.7%) additional tests were needed to final identification. sixteen  strains (9%) were not correctly identified (ic95 = 5.4-14.4); none of the 178 strains remained unidentified. the api coryne system, version 2.0, is useful to identify the majority of cory-nebacterium species with clinical relevance: corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium urealyticum, corynebacterium striatum,  corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum and related species such as arcanobacterium haemolyticum, dermabacter hominis, listeria monocytogenes, among others. nevertheless for yellow-pigmented diphteroid gram-positive rods (aureobacterium spp., leifsonia aquatica, microbacterium spp.  and cellulomonas spp.) and for acid fast gram-positive rods (rhodococcus, gordonia, tsukamurella and nocardia) the identification usefulness the system is  limited.

TI  == corynebacterium endocarditis species-specific risk factors and outcomes.
AB  == background: corynebacterium species are recognized as uncommon agents of endocarditis, but little is known regarding species-specific risk factors and outcomes in corynebacterium endocarditis. methods: case report and medline search of english language journals for cases of corynebacterium endocarditis. inclusion criteria required that cases be identified as endocarditis, having persistent corynebacterium bacteremia, murmurs described by the authors as identifying the affected valve, or vegetations found by echocardiography or in surgical or autopsy specimens. cases also required patient-specific information on risk factors and outcomes (age, gender, prior prosthetic valve, other prior nosocomial risk factors (infected valve, involvement of native versus prosthetic valve, need for valve replacement, and death) to be included in the analysis. publications of corynebacterium endocarditis which reported aggregate data were excluded. univariate analysis was conducted with chi-square and t-tests, as appropriate, with p = 0.05 considered significant. results: 129 cases of corynebacterium endocarditis involving nine species met inclusion criteria. corynebacterium endocarditis typically infects the left heart of adult males and nearly one third of patients have underlying valvular disease. one quarter of patients required valve replacement and one half of patients died. toxigenic c. diphtheriae is associated with pediatric infections (p < 0.001). only c. amycolatum has a predilection for women (p = 0.024), while c. pseudodiphtheriticum infections are  most frequent in men (p = 0.023). c. striatum, c. jeikeium and c. hemolyticum are associated with nosocomial risk factors (p < 0.001, 0.028, and 0.024, respectively). no species was found to have a predilection for any particular heart valve. c. pseudodiphtheriticum is associated with a previous prosthetic valve replacement (p = 0.004). c. jeikeium infections are more likely to require  valve replacement (p = 0.026). infections involving toxigenic c. diphtheriae and  c. pseudodiphtheriticum are associated with decreased survival (p = 0.001 and 0.032, respectively). conclusion: we report the first analysis of species-specific risk factors and outcomes in corynebacterium endocarditis. in addition to species-specific associations with age, gender, prior valvular diseases, and other nosocomial risk factors, we found differences in rates of need for valve replacement and death. this review highlights the seriousness of these infections, as up to 28% of patients required valve replacement and 43.5% died.

TI  == identification of the emerging skin pathogen corynebacterium amycolatum using pcr-amplification of the essential diviva gene as a target.
AB  == the actinomycete corynebacterium amycolatum is a saprophytic bacterium usually associated with the human skin, but it is at present considered an emergent pathogen as it is isolated from nosocomial settings from samples of immunosuppressed patients. the conventional method to distinguish c. amycolatum from closely related species is mainly based on phenotypic or chemotaxonomic studies. we developed a molecular method to identify rapidly c. amycolatum based  on the use of different primers for amplification of the cell division diviva gene using conventional or real-time pcr. this technique was used for the first time to distinguish c. amycolatum from the closely related corynebacterium striatum, corynebacterium minutissimum and corynebacterium xerosis, without the requirement of further molecular analysis. the suitability of the identification  method was tested on 51 clinical isolates belonging to the nonlipophilic fermentative group of corynebacteria (cluster c. striatum/c. amycolatum), which were accurately characterized by sequencing a 0.8 kb fragment of the 16s rrna gene.

TI  == relationship between mutations in the gyra gene and quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of corynebacterium striatum and corynebacterium amycolatum.
AB  == quinolone susceptibility was analyzed in 17 clinical isolates of corynebacterium  striatum and 9 strains of corynebacterium amycolatum by the e-test method in mueller-hinton agar plates. the c. striatum atcc 6940 strain was used as a control strain. the amplified quinolone resistance determining regions of the gyra genes of c. amycolatum and c. striatum were characterized. four in vitro quinolone-resistant mutants of c. amycolatum were selected and analyzed. both in  vivo and in vitro quinolone-resistant strains of c. amycolatum showed high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance in strains with a double mutation leading to an amino acid change in positions 87 and 91 or positions 87 and 88 (unusual mutation) of gyra, whereas the same concomitant mutations at amino acid positions 87 and 91 in gyra of c. striatum produced high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin but only showed a moderate increase in the mic of  moxifloxacin, suggesting that other mechanism(s) of quinolone resistance could be involved in moxifloxacin resistance in c. amycolatum. moreover, a pcr-rflp-ncoi of the gyra gene was developed to distinguish between c. amycolatum and c. striatum species.

TI  == characteristics of opportunistic species of the corynebacterium and related coryneforms isolated from different clinical materials.
AB  == taking into account the increasing contribution of species, which enter into the  composition of purely physiological flora of the organism, of the corynebacterium type and related coryneforms in opportunistic infections in people, the analysis  of strains was made from different clinical materials from patients. their identification was made on the basis of biochemical properties and their antibiotic sensitivity was characterized. it was found that strains with similar  biochemical properties (c.striatum, c.amycolatum ) should be identified by means  of genetic methods, all the more that they were isolated from clinically important materials. out of the examined strains the biggest number of infections were caused by c.pseudodiphtheriticum, next c. striatum/c. amycolatum, brevibacterium sp., c.propinquum, one: c.afermentans, c.jeikeium, c.group g, c.group f1, c.accolens, c.macqinleyi. the highest sensitivity of isolated strains was to vancomycin, teicoplanin and imipenem.

TI  == pyrolysis patterns of 5 close corynebacterium species analyzed by artificial neural networks.
AB  == in the present study, an artificial neural network was trained with the stuttgart neural networks simulator, in order to identify corynebacterium species by analyzing their pyrolysis patterns. an earlier study described the combination of pyrolysis, gas chromatography and atomic emission detection we used on whole cell bacteria. carbon, sulfur and nitrogen were detected in the pyrolysis compounds. pyrolysis patterns were obtained from 52 corynebacterium strains belonging to 5 close species. these data were previously analyzed by euclidean distances calculation followed by unweighted pair group method of averages, a clustering method. with this early method, strains from 3 of the 5 species (c. xerosis, c. freneyi and c. amycolatum) were correctly characterized even if the 29 strains of c. amycolatum were grouped into 2 subgroups. strains from the 2 remaining species (c. minutissimum and c. striatum) cannot be separated. to build an artificial neural network, able to discriminate the 5 previous species, the pyrolysis data of 42 selected strains were used as learning set and the 10 remaining strains as  testing set. the chosen learning algorithm was back-propagation with momentum. parameters used to train a correct network are described here, and the results analyzed. the obtained artificial neural network has the following cone-shaped structure: 144 nodes in input, 25 and 9 nodes in 2 successive hidden layers, and  then 5 outputs. it could classify all the strains in their species group. this network completes a chemotaxonomic method for corynebacterium identification.

TI  == corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov., from pigs.
AB  == nineteen strains of gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria isolated from pigs were characterized by using biochemical, molecular chemical and molecular genetic methods. two distinct groups of organisms were discerned, based on their colonial morphology, camp (christie-atkins-munch-petersen) reaction and numerical profile by using the api  coryne system. the first group (13 strains) gave a doubtful discrimination between corynebacterium striatum and corynebacterium amycolatum, whilst the second group (six strains) were identified tentatively as corynebacterium urealyticum. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies demonstrated that all of the isolates belonged phylogenetically to the genus corynebacterium: the first group of organisms was highly similar to corynebacterium testudinoris with respect to 16s rrna gene sequences and physiological characteristics, whereas the remaining six isolates formed a hitherto unknown subline within the genus, associated with a small subcluster of species that included corynebacterium auriscanis and its close relatives. the unknown corynebacterium sp. was distinguished readily from these and other species of the genus by biochemical tests. based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the new isolates from pigs should be classified as a novel species, corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov. the type strain is p81/02(t) (=cect 5724(t)=ccug 46963(t)).

TI  == coryneform bacteria isolated from blood cultures and their antibiotic susceptibilities.
AB  == we aimed to determine the types of corynebacteria isolated from the blood of patients at gaziantep university hospital, turkey, and their antibiotic susceptibilities. between february 1999 and june 2001, 3530 blood samples were cultured, of which 915 were found to be positive, and these were further investigated in the bacteriology laboratory. among positive blood cultures, coryneform bacteria were identified in 31 (3.4%) isolates. of these, 16 (51.6%) were corynebacterium jeikeium, six (19.4%) were corynebacterium striatum, four (12.9%) were corynebacterium amycolatum, two (6.5%) were cellulomonas species, two (6.5%) were corynebacterium afermentans and one isolate (3.2%) was corynebacterium propinquum. antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that c. jeikeium was resistant to various antibiotics, whereas all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. this study illustrates the importance  of taking coryneform bacteria into consideration when culturing blood samples. the need to identify the species and determine its antibiotic sensitivity is emphasized.

TI  == microbiological characterization and clinical significance of corynebacterium amycolatum strains.
AB  == the laboratory records of patients with bacillus isolates identified as corynebacterium xerosis were reviewed in an attempt to establish the clinical significance of the isolates, and the isolated strains were reidentified. of the  22 strains available for reidentification, four were identified as corynebacterium striatum and 18 as corynebacterium amycolatum. forty-one patients were considered to have corynebacterium amycolatum isolates, and in 13 (31.7%) of these patients a genuine clinical infection occurred, comprising catheter-related infection in seven cases, surgical wound infection in five cases, and pilonidal cyst infection in one case. most patients were treated with antimicrobial agents  (vancomycin in seven cases and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in four cases). all patients were cured. corynebacterium amycolatum can cause genuine infection, usually hospital-acquired, and the clinical significance of isolates must be determined to ensure proper management of patients.

TI  == in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin  and sparfloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes isolated  from clinical samples. the following organisms (and number of strains) were studied: corynebacterium jeikeium (20), corynebacterium urealyticum (20), corynebacterium minutissimum (20), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium amycolatum (30), brevibacterium spp. (15) and listeria monocytogenes (15). antimicrobial activity was determined by microdilution using cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth supplemented with 0.5% tween 80 when testing c. jeikeium or  c. urealyticum. fluoroquinolones were used in the range 0.015-16 mg/l. plates were incubated in air at 35 degrees c for 18-20 h (24 h when testing c. jeikeium  or c. urealyticum). the following mic50 values were obtained for all 140 organisms tested: levofloxacin, 1 mg/l; ofloxacin, 2 mg/l; d-ofloxacin, > 16 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 1 mg/l; norfloxacin, 16 mg/l; sparfloxacin, 1 mg/l. mic90 values were > 16 mg/l for all test antibiotics with the exception of levofloxacin, which had an mic90 value of 16 mg/l. at a concentration of 2 mg/l,  levofloxacin inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains and 35-93% of the remaining species. mic90 values of ofloxacin were one dilution step higher than those of levofloxacin against c. minutissimum, c. striatum, brevibacterium spp. and l. monocytogenes. levofloxacin showed similar (c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. amycolatum and brevibacterium spp.) or greater (c. minutissimum and c. striatum)  activity than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, and higher than d-ofloxacin or norfloxacin against all species studied. in conclusion, levofloxacin was the most active of the six fluoroquinolones evaluated against coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples and could therefore be a promising treatment option in this setting.

TI  == differentiation of corynebacterium amycolatum, c. minutissimum, and c. striatum by carbon substrate assimilation tests.
AB  == we tested the carbon substrate assimilation patterns of 40 corynebacterium amycolatum strains, 19 c. minutissimum strains, 50 c. striatum strains, and 1 c.  xerosis strain with the biotype 100 system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france).  twelve carbon substrates of 99 allowed discrimination among the species tested. additionally, assimilation of 3 of these 12 carbon substrates (maltose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, and phenylacetate) was tested with the api 20 ne identification system (biomerieux). since concordant results were observed with the two systems for these three carbon substrates, either identification system can be used as a supplementary tool to achieve phenotypic differential identification of c. amycolatum, c. minutissimum, and c. striatum in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli to hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and 14 other antimicrobials.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of the ketolide hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and those of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin compounds (erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, lincomycin, pristinamycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin) as well as those of benzylpenicillin, doxycycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin, levofloxacin, and rifapentine against 247 aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli were determined by an agar dilution method. the ketolide was active against most organisms tested except corynebacterium striatum, coryneform cdc group 12, and oerskovia spp. the frequency of resistance to erythromycin and other macrolides as well as that to lincomycin was high. pristinamycin and, to a  lesser extent, quinupristin-dalfopristin were very active, but resistance to these agents was present in some strains of rhodococcus equi, listeria spp., c. striatum, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and oerskovia spp. hmr 3647 was very active against all erythromycin-sensitive and many erythromycin-nonsusceptible strains, especially corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium. in vitro resistance to benzylpenicillin was common, but doxycycline, vancomycin,  and teicoplanin were very active against most organisms tested except e. rhusiopathiae, against which glycopeptide antibiotics were not active. the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was remarkable, but resistance to this agent was common for c. amycolatum, corynebacterium urealyticum, c. jeikeium, and oerskovia spp. strains. rifapentine was also very active in vitro against many organisms, but resistance to this agent was always present in e. rhusiopathiae and was very  common in c. striatum and c. urealyticum.

TI  == identification of corynebacterium amycolatum and other nonlipophilic fermentative corynebacteria of human origin.
AB  == four identification tests, proposed in addition to conventional methods, were evaluated with 320 fermentative nonlipophilic corynebacterium strains: growth at  20 degrees c, glucose fermentation at 42 degrees c, alkalinization of sodium formate, and acid production from ethylene glycol. these tests were highly discriminant. corynebacterium amycolatum displayed a unique profile, allowing it  to be distinguished from similar species, such as c. xerosis, c. striatum, and c. minutissimum.

TI  == prospective study of catalase-positive coryneform organisms in clinical specimens: identification, clinical relevance, and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == during a 6-month period, all clinical isolates of catalase-positive coryneform organisms, which were isolated during the routine processing of clinical specimens, were characterized in the laboratory of the 1800-bed university hospital of leuven. the distribution of the species in the corynebacteria was: corynebacterium amycolatum 70 (53%), corynebacterium jeikeium 16 (12%), corynebacterium striatum 11 (8%), corynebacterium afermentans 10 (7%), corynebacterium minutissimum 9 (6%), cdc coryneform group g 4 (3%), corynebacterium urealyticum 4 (3%), corynebacterium glucuronolyticum 1 (0.7%), and corynebacterium xerosis 1 (0.7%). of the 150 isolates, 37 (25%) were considered to be infection related and the remaining 113 (75%) were of questionable clinical significance. susceptibility of the corynebacteria to 12 antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms was evaluated. c. amycolatum,  c. jeikeium, and c. urealyticum were multiresistant, but all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and vancomycin. most of the c. amycolatum strains, and all strains of c. jeikeium and c. striatum, were susceptible to the vibrocidal compound o/129.

TI  == species identities and antimicrobial susceptibilities of corynebacteria isolated  from various clinical sources.
AB  == over a 14-month period, 415 clinical isolates of coryneform gram-positive rods were recovered from various sources and identified to the species level according to recent identification schemes. corynebacterium urealyticum, corynebacterium striatum, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium predominated,  accounting for 63% of all isolates. corynebacterium accolens, corynebacterium striatum, corynebacterium argentoratense, corynebacterium propinquum and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum were mostly recovered from the respiratory tract, whereas corynebacterium afermentans, cdc group g, and corynebacterium jeikeium were mainly isolated from blood. none of the isolates was identified as  corynebacterium diphtheriae or corynebacterium xerosis. ampicillin resistance was detected in corynebacterium jeikeium (96%) and corynebacterium urealyticum (99%)  and varied among corynebacterium amycolatum (56%) and cdc group g (26%). these data emphasize the need for an accurate identification of coryneform organisms at the species level and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of these organisms.

TI  == evaluation of the applicability of amplified rdna-restriction analysis (ardra) to identification of species of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == the 16s rrna genes (rdna) of 50 strains belonging to 26 different coryneform bacterial species and genomospecies and of the type strain of rhodococcus equi were enzymatically amplified. amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra) with the enzymes alui, cfoi and rsai was carried out. the combination of the ardra patterns obtained after restriction with these three different enzymes enabled the differentiation between the following species: corynebacterium accolens (number of strains = 2), c. afermentans subsp. afermentans (2), c. afermentans subsp. lipophilum (2), c. amycolatum (3), cdc coryneform group anf-1-like (1), cdc coryneform group anf-3-like (1), c. cystitidis (1), c. diphtheriae (4), c. jeikeium (3), c. macginleyi (2), c. minutissimum (1), c. pilosum (1), c. pseudotuberculosis (2), c. renale (2), c. striatum (2), c. urealyticum (3), c. xerosis (1), cdc coryneform groups b-1 (2), b-3 (2), f-1, genomospecies 1 and 2 (6), g, genomospecies 1 (1) and g, genomospecies 2 (2). the following strains or  species could not be differentiated from each other: c. pseudodiphtheriticum (2)  from c. propinquum (former cdc coryneform group anf-3) (2), cdc coryneform group  f-1, genomospecies 1 (4) from genomospecies 2 (2) and c. jeikeium genomospecies a (1) from genomospecies c (2). ardra may represent a possible alternative for identification of coryneforms, since this technique enabled the identification of most coryneforms tested and since dna extraction (i.e. cell lysis by boiling), amplification, restriction and electrophoresis can be carried out within 8 hours. this might allow quick identification of c. diphtheriae and other possible pathogens of the genus corynebacterium.

TI  == comparative chemotaxonomic studies of mycolic acid-free coryneform bacteria of human origin.
AB  == forty-two clinical isolates were classified as corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium cdc group i by the api coryne system. the chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolates were determined by thin-layer chromatographic analysis. twenty-six isolates were found to have a type iv cell wall (meso-di-aminopimelic acid arabinose, galactose) but did not contain mycolic acids. these 26 isolates shared chemotaxonomic characteristics with those of mycolic acid-free reference strains (including the corynebacterium  amycolatum ncfb 2768 type strain, "corynebacterium asperum," and coryneform cdc groups i2 and f2). the total protein profiles of the isolates determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were similar to each other and to that of the c. amycolatum type strain. the profiles of the reference strains "corynebacterium asperum" (cip 100836, cip 80.54, cip 79.37, cip 52.13),  coryneform bacteria cdc groups i2 and f2 (cdc f5771, f5890, g723, g1970), and c.  amycolatum were closely related. thus, the mycolic acid-negative strains with a chemotype iv wall may belong to a single taxon. dna hybridization studies could confirm this hypothesis. the present study shows the importance of chemotaxonomic analysis for verifying strain identifications and completing results from biochemical tests, particularly for coryneform bacteria.
