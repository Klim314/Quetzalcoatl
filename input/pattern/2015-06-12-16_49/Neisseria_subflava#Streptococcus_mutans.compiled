TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  - Clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. The crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. Concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. Comparable numbers of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Neisseria subflava, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. Quantitative fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. Biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific fluorescent stains. Anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm EPS and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (P < 0.05). Sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm EPS in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (P < 0.05). CLSM demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm EPS, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (P < 0.05). Agents in oral hygiene formulations (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (P < 0.05). Multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm EPS and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - Analysis of pH-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  - Previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the pH  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. The aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated pH at which such shifts occurred. Nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. In one chemostat, pH control was discontinued for 6 h, and the pH fall was restricted to a minimum value of pH 5.5; the pH fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either pH 5. 0, or at pH 4.5. When the pH was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the pH fall. Veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially at low pH. The increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis). The counts of these species were relatively stable between pH 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the pH fell below pH 4.5; Neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at pH 4.5 or below. The data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low pH can be explained in terms of a two-stage process. A fall in pH to a value between pH 5.5 and 4.5 may allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. A further reduction in pH (<pH 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. The results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at pH values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.
TI  - Bacteriolytic action of fluoride ions.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria subflava, and LYT coccus were found to undergo massive lysis after growth in media containing 0.01 to 10 mM NaF. When cells of these organisms were transferred from late-exponential-phase cultures to 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.1 M KCl, they underwent spontaneous autolysis. Cells grown in media with fluoride were more liable to autolysis, and walls isolated from them also showed enhanced autolytic sensitivity, even though added fluoride did not directly stimulate autolysins. Sporadic or partial lysis occurred in populations of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans BHT or LM-7 after growth in fluoridated media. Most bacteria that were tested did not undergo fluoride-induced lysis. However, cells of all test bacteria were found to have reduced amounts of peptidoglycan per unit of cell weight when grown in the presence of fluoride. Incorporation of labeled lysine or glucosamine into peptidoglycan (Park-Hancock residue) was stimulated, instead of inhibited, by fluoride. However, fluoride also stimulated the loss of radioactivity from Park-Hancock residues of cells that had previously incorporated labeled lysine or glucosamine. Thus, fluoride appeared to enhance peptidoglycan turnover, and this turnover reduced the peptidoglycan contents of all bacteria tested, but induced lysis in only those bacteria that normally have highly active autolytic systems.
