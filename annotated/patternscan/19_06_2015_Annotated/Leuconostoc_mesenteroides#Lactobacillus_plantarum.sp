TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria that can form mixed-species biofilm with saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == the abilities of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to form mixed-species biofilm with saccharomyces cerevisiae in a static co-culture were investigated out of 168 lab  stock cultures, and two lactobacillus plantarum strains (d71 and e31) and one leuconostoc mesenteroides strain k01 were found to form mixed-species biofilm with s. cerevisiae by4741. sem observation showed that there was no significant difference in morphological properties among these three mixed-species biofilms and they resembled that formed by s. cerevisiae with l. plantarum ml11-11 previously isolated from a brewing sample of fukuyama pot vinegar. the co-aggregation assays showed that l. plantarum d71 and l. plantarum e31 could co-aggregate with s. cerevisiae similarly to l. plantarum ml11-11, while l. mesenteroides k01 had no ability to co-aggregate with yeast. the above results indicate that aggregation followed by direct cell-to-cell contact is required for mixed-species biofilm formation between these l. plantarum strains and s. cerevisiae, though some different mechanism may be involved in biofilm formation  between l. mesenteroides strain and s. cerevisiae.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == exploitation of albanian wheat cultivars: characterization of the flours and lactic acid bacteria microbiota, and selection of starters for sourdough fermentation.
AB  == six albanian soft and durum wheat cultivars were characterized based on chemical  and technological features, showing different attitudes for bread making. gliadin and glutenin fractions were selectively extracted from flours, and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. linja 7 and lvs flours showed the best characteristics, and abundance of high molecular weight (hmw)-glutenins. type i sourdoughs were prepared through back slopping procedure, and the lactic acid bacteria were typed and identified. lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides were the predominant species. thirty-eight representative isolates  were singly used for sourdough fermentation of soft and durum wheat albanian flours and their selection was carried out based on growth and acidification, quotient of fermentation, and proteolytic activity. two different pools of lactic acid bacteria were designed to ferment soft or durum wheat flours. sourdough fermentation with mixed and selected starters positively affected the quotient of fermentation, concentration of free amino acids, profile of phenolic acids, and antioxidant and phytase activities. this study provided the basis to exploit the  potential of wheat albanian flours based on an integrated approach, which considered the characterization of the flours and the processing conditions.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == in vitro selection and characterization of new probiotic candidates from table olive microbiota.
AB  == to date, only a few studies have investigated the complex microbiota of table olives in order to identify new probiotic microorganisms, even though this food matrix has been shown to be a suitable source of beneficial lactic acid bacteria  (lab). two hundred and thirty eight lab, belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, and isolated from nocellara etnea table olives, have been screened in this survey through an in vitro approach. a simulation of transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, together with autoaggregation and hydrophobicity, have been decisive in reducing the number of lab to 17 promising probiotics. none of the selected strains showed intrinsic resistances towards a broad spectrum of antibiotics and were therefore accurately characterized on an undifferentiated and 3d functional model of the human intestinal tract made up of h4-1 epithelial  cells. as far as the potential colonization of the intestinal tract is concerned, a high adhesion ratio was observed for lb. plantarum o2t60c (over 9%) when tested in the 3d functional model, which closely mimics real intestinal conditions. the  stimulation properties towards the epithelial barrier integrity and the in vitro  inhibition of l. monocytogenes adhesion and invasion have also been assessed. lb. plantarum s1t10a and s11t3e enhanced trans-epithelial electrical resistance (teer) and therefore the integrity of the polarized epithelium in the 3d model. moreover, s11t3e showed the ability to inhibit l. monocytogenes invasion in the undifferentiated epithelial model. the reduction in l. monocytogenes infection, together with the potential enhancement of barrier integrity and an adhesion ratio that was above the average in the 3d functional model (6.9%) would seem to  suggest the lb. plantarum s11t3e strain as the most interesting candidate for possible in vivo animal and human trials.

TI  == diversity of the lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiota in the switch from firm- to liquid-sourdough fermentation.
AB  == four traditional type i sourdoughs were comparatively propagated (28 days) under  firm (dough yield, 160) and liquid (dough yield, 280) conditions to mimic the alternative technology options frequently used for making baked goods. after 28 days of propagation, liquid sourdoughs had the lowest ph and total titratable acidity (tta), the lowest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids and free amino acids, and the most stable density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria. the cell density of yeasts was the highest in liquid sourdoughs. liquid sourdoughs showed simplified microbial diversity and harbored a low number of strains, which were persistent. lactobacillus plantarum dominated firm sourdoughs over time. leuconostoc lactis and lactobacillus brevis dominated only some firm sourdoughs,  and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis persisted for some time only in some firm sourdoughs. leuconostoc citreum persisted in all firm and liquid sourdoughs, and  it was the only species detected in liquid sourdoughs at all times; it was flanked by leuconostoc mesenteroides in some sourdoughs. saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida humilis, saccharomyces servazzii, saccharomyces bayanus-kazachstania sp., and torulaspora delbrueckii were variously identified in firm and liquid sourdoughs. a total of 197 volatile components were identified through purge and trap-/solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt-/spme-gc-ms). aldehydes, several alcohols, and some esters were  at the highest levels in liquid sourdoughs. firm sourdoughs mainly contained ethyl acetate, acetic acid, some sulfur compounds, and terpenes. the use of liquid fermentation would change the main microbial and biochemical features of traditional baked goods, which have been manufactured under firm conditions for a long time.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == application' and validation of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starter cultures for controlled leek fermentations and their influence on the antioxidant properties of leek.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important outdoor vegetables, mainly cultivated for its white shaft. fermentation of leek offers opportunities in view of biomass valorization and product diversification. this study deals with the implementation and validation of starter cultures to perform controlled leek fermentations and to ensure a high quality of the end-products. therefore, a thorough study of the fermentation microbiology and the influence of three starter culture strains (lactobacillus plantarum imdo 788, lactobacillus sakei imdo 1358, and leuconostoc mesenteroides imdo 1347) on the metabolite kinetics of leek fermentation and antioxidant properties of leek was performed. overall, the application of lactic acid bacteria starter cultures resulted in a fast prevalence of the species involved, coupled to an accelerated acidification. of the three starter cultures tested, the mixed starter culture of l. plantarum imdo 788 and l. mesenteroides imdo 1347 was most promising, as its application resulted in fermented leek of good microbiological quality and in a more extensive carbohydrate consumption, whereby diverse end-metabolites were produced. however, high residual fructose concentrations allowed yeast outgrowth, resulting in increased ethanol and glycerol concentrations, and indicated the lack of a prevailing strictly heterofermentative lab species. the antioxidant capacity of fermented leek samples, as measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay, increased when starter cultures were used, whereas with regard to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, only leek fermented with l. sakei imdo 1358 scored higher than spontaneously fermented leek. the total phenolic content was not influenced by the use of starter cultures, while the s-alk(en)yl-l-cysteine sulfoxides content decreased strongly. a preliminary sensory analysis revealed that the spontaneously fermented leek and the one obtained with the mixed starter culture were preferred by consumers, emphasizing again the importance of microbial successions in vegetable fermentations.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  == the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to  be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 lactobacillus plantarum, 37 lb. pentosus, 1 lb. paraplantarum, and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. lb. rhamnosus gg and lb. casei shirota were used as reference strains. the in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7), caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. three (3)  lb. pentosus, 4 lb. plantarum and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low ph. the majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 lb. plantarum and 7 lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. none of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. variable efficiency to adhere to caco-2 cells was observed. this was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. none of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. as a whole,  4 strains of lb. pentosus, 3 strains of lb. plantarum and 2 strains of lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains lb. casei shirota and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.

TI  == species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important vegetables. all or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. this study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added nacl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. the combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was  not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated lab species. both added nacl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. by that time, glucose and fructose,  the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. a sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus brevis l62 strain, highly tolerant to copper ions.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) as starter culture in food industry must be suitable for large-scale industrial production and possess the ability to survive in unfavorable processes and storage conditions. approaches taken to address these problems include the selection of stress-resistant strains. in food industry, lab are often exposed to metal ions induced stress. the interactions between lab and  metal ions are very poorly investigated. because of that, the influence of non-toxic, toxic and antioxidant metal ions (zn, cu, and mn) on growth, acid production, metal ions binding capacity of wild and adapted species of leuconostoc mesenteroides l3, lactobacillus brevis l62 and lactobacillus plantarum l73 were investigated. the proteomic approach was applied to clarify how the lab cells, especially the adapted ones, protect themselves and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metal ions. results have shown that zn and mn addition into mrs medium in the investigated concentrations did not have effect on the bacterial growth and acid production, while copper ions were highly toxic, especially in static conditions. leuc. mesenteroides l3 was the most efficient in zn binding processes among the chosen lab species, while l. plantarum l73 accumulated the highest concentration of mn. l. brevis l62 was the most copper resistant species. adaptation had a positive effect on growth and acid production of all species in the presence of copper. however, the adapted species incorporated less metal ions than the wild species. the exception was adapted l.  brevis l62 that accumulated high concentration of copper ions in static conditions. the obtained results showed that l. brevis l62 is highly tolerant to  copper ions, which allows its use as starter culture in fermentative processes in media with high concentration of copper ions.

TI  == optimization of electrotransformation conditions for leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293.
AB  == aims: to establish an efficient genetic transformation protocol for leuconostoc species, methods for competent-cell preparation and electroporation conditions were optimized. methods and results: leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293 cells were sequentially treated with penicillin g and lysozyme, and the plasmid pleucm was subsequently transformed into the cells. our results demonstrated that transformation efficiencies were significantly increased (100-fold), and increased electric field strength also contributed to enhance transformation efficiency. maximum transformation efficiency (1x10(4) or  more transformants per mug dna) was achieved when cells were grown in de man, rogosa, sharpe (mrs) media containing 0.25 mol l(-1) sucrose and 0.8 mug ml(-1) penicillin g, followed by treatment with 600 u ml(-1) lysozyme and electroporation at a field strength of 10 kv cm(-1). when this protocol was used  to transform pleucm into leuc. mesenteroides, leuconostoc gelidum, leuconostoc fallax and leuconostoc argentinun, successful transformations were obtained in all cases. furthermore, this procedure was applicable to species belonging to other genera, including lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. conclusions: the results demonstrate that the transformation efficiency for leuconostoc spp. could be increased via optimization of the entire electroporation procedures. significance and impact of the study: these optimized conditions can be used for the extensive genetic study and the metabolic engineering of not only leuconostoc spp. but also different species of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics, lactic acid bacteria species diversity and metabolite kinetics of traditional romanian vegetable fermentations.
AB  == background: artisanal vegetable fermentations are very popular in eastern european countries. fresh vegetables undergo a spontaneous fermentation in the presence of salt, which is mainly carried out by lactic acid bacteria (lab). results: culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses of end-samples of various spontaneous vegetable fermentations carried out in houses of the chiodju  region (central romania) revealed lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis as the most frequently isolated lab species. leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were also found. furthermore, the community dynamics of spontaneous cauliflower and mixed-vegetable (green tomatoes, carrots and cauliflower) fermentations revealed three steps: an initial phase characterised by the presence of enterobacteriaceae and a wide lab species diversity, encompassing weissella species; a second phase from day 3 onwards wherein l. citreum and lb. brevis occurred; and a final phase characterised by the prevalence of lb. brevis and lb. plantarum. metabolite target analysis revealed that glucose and fructose were mostly depleted at the end of fermentation. the main products of carbohydrate metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol and small amounts of mannitol, indicating heterolactate fermentation. conclusion: given their prevalence at the end of vegetable fermentations, lb. brevis and lb.  plantarum appear to be good candidate starter cultures for controlled vegetable fermentation processes.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

AB  == listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis in humans mainly through consumption of ready-to-eat foods. immunocompromised persons, the elderly, and pregnant women and their fetuses or newborns are at highest risk for the infection. to isolate probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) with inhibitory effects against l. monocytogenes, we screened for acid and bile resistant labs from narezushi, a traditional salted and long-fermented fish with cooked rice. then, inhibitory effects of the selected labs on l. monocytogenes invasion and infection of human  enterocyte caco-2 cells and listeria-susceptible a/j mice were determined. from a total of 231 lab isolates, we selected five acid and bile resistant isolates (four were lactobacillus plantarum and one was leuconostoc mesenteroides). among  the five isolates, ln. mesenteroides (lnm-1rm3) showed the highest inhibition against l. monocytogenes invasion into caco-2 cells. in the case of l. monocytogenes orally infected a/j mice, recovery of the pathogen from the spleen  was suppressed by drinking water containing 9 log cfu/ml of lnm-1rm3 cells. the inhibitory effects were also shown by heat-killed lnm-1rm3 cells. these results suggest that live and also heat-killed lnm-1rm3 cell intake might prevent l. monocytogenes entero-gastric invasion and infection.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == expression of immune-related genes in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) induced by probiotic bacteria during lactococcus garvieae infection.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10(6) cfu g(-)(1) feed to fish for 36 days. twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with lactococcus garvieae. only the fish fed the diet containing lb. plantarum showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved protection against l. garvieae compared to the control. subsequently, real-time pcr was employed to determine the mrna levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and tnf-alpha in the head kidney, and il-8, tlr5 and igt in the intestine of the control and lb. plantarum groups. il-1beta, il-10 and tnf-alpha gene expression were significantly up-regulated by lb. plantarum. moreover, the mrna levels of il-10, il-8 and igt were significantly higher in the lb. plantarum group after l. garvieae infection, suggesting that lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. pcr-dgge revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. these findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. furthermore, as l. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards l. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cucumber fermentation brines.
AB  == bacterial pathogens have been reported on fresh cucumbers and other vegetables used for commercial fermentation. the food and drug administration currently has  a 5-log reduction standard for e. coli o157:h7 and other vegetative pathogens in  acidified pickle products. for fermented vegetables, which are acid foods, there  is little data documenting the conditions needed to kill acid resistant pathogens. to address this knowledge gap, we obtained 10 different cucumber fermentation brines at different stages of fermentation from 5 domestic commercial plants. cucumber brines were used to represent vegetable fermentations because cabbage and other vegetables may have inhibitory compounds that may affect survival. the 5-log reduction times for e. coli o157:h7 strains in the commercial brines were found to be positively correlated with brine ph, and ranged from 3 to 24 d for ph values of 3.2 to 4.6, respectively. in a laboratory  cucumber juice medium that had been previously fermented with lactobacillus plantarum or leuconostoc mesenteroides (ph 3.9), a 5-log reduction was achieved within 1 to 16 d depending on ph, acid concentration, and temperature. during competitive growth at 30 degrees c in the presence of l. plantarum or l. mesenteroides in cucumber juice, e. coli o157:h7 cell numbers were reduced to below the level of detection within 2 to 3 d. these data may be used to aid manufacturers of fermented vegetable products determine safe production practices based on fermentation ph and temperature. practical application: disease causing  strains of the bacterium e. coli may be present on fresh vegetables. our investigation determined the time needed to kill e. coli in cucumber fermentation brines and how e. coli strains are killed in competition with naturally present lactic acid bacteria. our results showed how brine ph and other brine conditions  affected the killing of e. coli strains. these data can be used by producers of fermented vegetable products to help assure consumer safety.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of ribeira sacra.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, ribeira sacra in north-west spain. methods and results: over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were identified as the following species: lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), leuconostoc fructosum (synon. lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), oenococcus oeni (59%), pediococcus parvulus (7%) and  weisella paramesenteroides (synon. leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). of these species, o. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (mlf) in all cellars and years with the exception of lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and lact. brevis, lact. frumenti and ped. parvulus coexisting with o. oeni in one cellar in 2009. different strains (84) of lab species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (api strips, the presence  of plasmids, enzyme activities and mlf performance) and molecular techniques (pcr). all assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. to select  candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase  and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. conclusions: a high diversity of lab is present in the grape musts of ribeira sacra but few species are responsible for mlf; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. as far as we are aware, this is the first report of lact. frumenti thriving in wine. significance and impact of the study: information on lab populations in must and  wine is presented. a large collection of well-characterized strains of lab are available as starter cultures to winemakers.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == this study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (gh42) beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus acidophilus (laca) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of onpg, pnpg and pnpg-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (goss) formation to gh2 beta-galactosidases of streptococcus thermophilus (lacz type), lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both laclm type). beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with l. lactis crude cell extract (cce). the novel gh42 beta-galactosidase of lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, onpg and pnpg but higher relative activity on pnp analogues compared to gh2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. temperature and ph optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between gh2 beta-galactosidases. onpg and pnpg were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pnpg-analogues was less than 1.5%. gh2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar gos with varying preferences. the diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in l. lactis cce can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.

TI  == control of dongchimi fermentation with chitosan deacetylated by alkali treatment  to prevent over-ripening.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of chitosan against lactic acid bacteria were studied to apply for controlling dongchimi (whole-radish juicy kimchi) fermentation to prevent over-ripening. antimicrobial activity of chitosan against lactic acid bacteria such as leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum was assayed at 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/l concentration in the medium. the addition of 40 mg/l of the chitosan prepared at 140 degrees c for 10 min showed strong inhibitory effect on the growth of l. mesenteroides and l. plantarum. the effects of addition of chitosan to dongchimi have also been studied during fermentation at different temperatures of 4, 10, and 20 degrees c. addition of chitosan decreased markedly viable cell counts of lactic acid bacteria such as leuconostoc spp. and lactobacillus spp. at the initial stage. subsequently the lactic acid bacteria recovered the growth to the same level as non-chitosan treated dongchimi. during the dongchimi fermentation, the addition of chitosan at larger  quantity up to 1000 mg/l (cs1000) prolonged the palatable fermentation period. addition of chitosan in the dongchimi seemed to inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria, thereby lowering the acid content. it, therefore, caused the shelf life to be extended and resulted in a prolonged palatable period for the dongchimi.

TI  == enzymatic activity of lactic acid bacteria (with antimicrobial properties) isolated from a traditional spanish cheese.
AB  == twenty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a traditional spanish cheese (genestoso cheese) were evaluated for their enzymatic activities (acidifying and proteolytic abilities and carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, caseinolytic and esterase activities), in order to select indigenous strains of technical interest for the manufacture of cheese. these strains were selected on the basis of their antimicrobial activity relative to five reference  strains and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (thirteen strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (two strains), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (one strain), lactobacillus paracasei (two strains), lactobacillus plantarum (one strain) and enterococcus faecalis (five strains). lactococcus strains were those that showed the greatest degree of acidifying and  proteolytic activity. the cell-free extracts (cfe) of l. paracasei exhibited the  highest level of aminopeptidase activity. the highest level of caseinolytic activity was shown by the cfe of one strain of l. lactis. high values were also obtained with the cfe of lactobacillus and of several leuconostoc. the highest level of dipeptidase activity was found amongst the strains of l. lactis. carboxypeptidase activity was generally very low or undetectable for the majority of strains. the greatest degree of esterolytic activity was detected for enterococcus.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == chemical evaluation and sensory quality of sauerkrauts obtained by natural and induced fermentations at different nacl levels from brassica oleracea var. capitata cv. bronco grown in eastern spain. effect of storage.
AB  == the aim of the present work was to optimize fermentation conditions of white cabbage ( brassica oleracea l. var. capitata cv. bronco) grown in winter in eastern spain. the influence of two salt concentrations (0.5 and 1.5% nacl) in combination with spontaneous or induced cabbage fermentation on the content of ascorbigen (abg) and vitamin c as well as on the sensory quality of sauerkraut was investigated. the effect of storage at 4 degrees c for 1-3 months was also studied. abg content increased from 14 micromol/100 g of dm in raw cabbage to 63-137 micromol/100 g of dm during fermentation, whereas vitamin c decreased from 354 to 236-277 mg/100 g of dm, and the variations depended on the fermentation conditions. sauerkrauts obtained by leuconostoc mesenteroides at 0.5% nacl showed the highest abg content and a large amount of vitamin c. refrigeration for 1-3 months led to a reduction of abg and vitamin c levels, but l. mesenteroides sauerkrauts presented considerable amounts of both compounds at the end of the storage period (74-82 micromol/100 g of dm and 33-44 mg/100 g of dm, respectively), higher than those found with lactobacillus plantarum and the mixed starter culture before storage. experimental sauerkrauts presented better organoleptic properties than the commercial products, and no differences in overall acceptability were found among natural fermentations and those performed  with starter cultures. these results suggest than low-salted sauerkraut produced  with l. mesenteroides provided highly beneficial antioxidant and anticarcinogenic compounds and low sodium content, which is in accordance with the general trend in industrialized countries of reducing the salt level of foods to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == microbiota analysis of caspian sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in japan.
AB  == we analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, caspian sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in japanese), circulated in japan. we collected six varieties from five localities. lactococcus (l) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g. we show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (eps) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. from analysis of the rapd pattern of 60  bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. furthermore, pfge analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. this suggests these l. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in caspian sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in japan. in addition, lactobacillus (l.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; l. plantarum, gluconoacetobacter sacchari and acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and l. paracasei, l. kefiri, leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == probiotics, critical illness, and methodologic bias.
AB  == it has been proposed that probiotics can favorably influence the course of critically ill patients. to address this question, a limited systematic review was undertaken (medline search for articles published in english) to identify randomized, controlled trials that compared a group of critically ill patients taking probiotics with a group that did not. ten such trials, mostly with high risks of methodologic bias, were identified. when the data were combined, the probiotics did not appear to influence mortality or duration of hospitalization.  however, the recipients of the probiotics had fewer infectious episodes (absolute risk difference-21%). this effect was seen particularly in trials employing one combination of probiotic agents (pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum). unfortunately,  this effect may be overly optimistic, as methodologic shortcomings could have introduced biases into the trials. three trials of patients with severe acute pancreatitis were not included in this primary analysis because not all of the patients were in the intensive care unit. the largest of these, and the one with  the lowest risk of bias, demonstrated that probiotics increased mortality, in part because of the precipitation of ischemic bowel disease (in patients who were also receiving postpyloric enteral nutrition infusions). probiotics also appeared to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients, although these trials did not specifically focus only on those who were critically ill. in summary, it is not clear that probiotics are beneficial (and they may even be harmful) in the critically ill patient group.

TI  == detection of arc genes related with the ethyl carbamate precursors in wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == trace amounts of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate can appear in wine by the reaction of ethanol with compounds such as citrulline and carbamyl phosphate, which are produced from arginine degradation by some wine lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, the presence of arc genes for the arginine-deiminase pathway was studied in several strains of different species of lab. their ability to degrade arginine was also studied. to detect the presence of arc genes, degenerate primers were designed from the alignment of protein sequences in already sequenced lab. the usefulness of these degenerate primers has been proven by sequencing some of the amplified pcr fragments and searching for homologies with published sequences of the same species and related ones. correlation was found between the presence of genes and the ability to degrade arginine. degrading strains included all heterofermentative lactobacilli, oenococcus oeni , pediococcus pentosaceus , and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum .

AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == effects of initial air removal methods on microorganisms and characteristics of fermented plant beverages.
AB  == the effects of 3 different methods for removing the initial air on the properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham.) were investigated. only method m which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water filled plastic bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. however, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. the fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4  pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its  higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1-5 using the method m from both fermented plant beverages were leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4-5 in the wild forest noni beverage. from days 6-14 the isolates were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only l. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. during days 21-45 both beverages had a similar lab population of l. plantarum and l. brevis while l. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage. between days 60-90 in both plant beverages only l. plantarum and lactobacillius sp. were detected.

TI  == occurrence of lactic acid bacteria and biogenic amines in biologically aged wines.
AB  == biologically aged sherry-type wines are elaborated by the so-called 'criadera and solera' system, which essentially involves development of the yeast on the wine surface forming a film velum for several years. lactic acid bacteria can also develop and contribute to sherry-type wine quality, although their presence and role in this enological process have received very little attention. in this study, lactic acid bacteria microbiota and the presence of biogenic amines were investigated throughout the manufacture and biological aging of 36 samples of sherry wines. malolactic fermentation was found to mainly take place during the first stage of biological ageing. the incidence and populations of lactic acid bacteria in sherry wines were low. the diversity of bacterial species isolated from the wines was greater than previously reported and included species of lactobacillus, with prevailing lactobacillus hilgardii, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus zeae and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the biogenic amine-producing capacity of the isolates was also determined. five strains were putrescine producers, while another strain was shown to produce tyramine and phenylethylamine, simultaneously. l. zeae was one of the predominant species in wines during the biological aging and seemed to be one of the main putrescine producers. the biogenic amine composition of the wines investigated was similar to that reported for other types of wines. putrescine was the major amine, followed by cadaverine, histamine and tyramine. the amine contents detected were  lower than those usually reported in red wines.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous mixed starter for lactic acid fermentation of  carrots, french beans or marrows.
AB  == strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, weissella soli/weissella koreensis, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus fermentum were identified from raw carrots, french beans and marrows by partial 16s rrna gene sequence. l. plantarum m1, leuc. mesenteroides c1 and p. pentosaceus f4 were selected based on the rates of growth and acidification in vegetable juice media, and used as the autochthonous mixed starter for the fermentation of carrots, french beans or marrows. an allochthonous starter, consisting of the same species, was also used for fermentation. a two-step fermentation process (1 day at 25 degrees c and 7 days at 15 degrees c) in brine (1% w/v) followed by storage at room temperature in olive oil until 40 days was set up. unstarted vegetables subjected to the same treatments were used as the controls. cell numbers of lactic acid bacteria in the started vegetables were ca. 10,000 (autochthonous starter) and 1000 (allochthonous starter) times higher than unstarted samples throughout the process. when fermented with the autochthonous starter, carrots, french beans or  marrows were characterized by the rapid decrease of ph (<4.5), marked consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, and inhibition of enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. fermentation with the allochthonous starter did not acidify and inhibit bacteria  and yeasts so rapidly. after 40 days, carrots, french beans and marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter had significantly (p<0.05) higher total concentration of vitamin c (ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) with respect to those fermented with the allochthonous starter and, especially unstarted vegetables. the same was found for the indexes of color. firmness of both started vegetables  was higher than unstarted vegetables. sensory analysis differentiated started vegetables. carrots and french beans fermented with the autochthonous starter were, especially, appreciated for fragrance. appearance was the sensory attribute that mainly distinguished marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  == the ethanol production in brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. this work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic  fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. lower mic was found for b. subtilis (10 ppm) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of kamoran(r) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for b. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this kamoran(r) dosage. the growth of  industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than  wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. the main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.

TI  == survival rate analysis of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria using the arrhenius and z-value models.
AB  == the survival rate of five freeze-dried bacteria species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, weisella paramesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus fermentum, was described in terms of reaction rate constants (d or k) and temperature sensitivity of rate constants (z or ea). the freeze-dried strains were stored under vacuum at 55, 37, and 4 degrees c for 168 h, 17 days, and 2 months, respectively. d-values decreased and k increased with an increase of the storage temperature. neither the z-value nor the inactivation energy (ea)  of the reaction was significantly different (p > 0.05) for all the strains, suggesting that thermal inactivation of the freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria may occur by the same mechanism. therefore, it was possible to compare rate constants of survival for the freeze-dried strains studied.

TI  == identification of the agent from lactobacillus plantarum kfri464 that enhances bacteriocin production by leuconostoc citreum gj7.
AB  == aim: to provide evidence that the production of bacteriocin by lactic acid bacteria can be enhanced by the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain and identify the agent that is responsible for enhancing bacteriocin production. methods and results: one bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacterium was isolated from kimchi. the strain gj7 was designated as leuconostoc citreum gj7 based on gram staining, biochemical properties, and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolate  produced a heat- and ph-stable bacteriocin (kimchicin gj7), which has antagonistic activity against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified kimchicin gj7 showed a single band of molecular weight c. 3500 da. cultures of leuc. citreum gj7 in the presence of thermally inactivated kimchicin gj7-sensitive strains, lactobacillus plantarum kfri 464, lactobacillus delbrueckii kfri 347, or leuconostoc mesenteroides kctc 1628, increased bacteriocin production. this inducing factor was characterized and purified from lact. plantarum kfri 464, which showed the greatest enhancement of kimchicin gj7 activity. the inducing factor was purified using a deae (diethyl aminoethyl)-sephacel column and high-performance liquid chromatography, and yielded a single band of c. 6500 da.  n-terminal sequencing of the inducing factor identified 16 amino acids. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor was synthesized and examined for the induction of kimchicin gj7 activity, and was found to induce activity, but at a level about 10% lower than that of the entire molecule. conclusions: the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain, lact. plantarum kfri 464, acts as an environmental stimulus to activate the production of kimchicin gj7 by leuc. citreum gj7. the inducing factor from lact. plantarum kfri 464 is highly homologous to the 30s ribosomal protein s16 from various micro-organisms. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor examined in this study is a very important sequence related to the inducing activity. nevertheless, the inducing factor may not be part of the ribosomal protein s16 itself. significance and impact of the study: we believe that the present study is the first to identify an agent that is produced by one micro-organism and influences bacteriocin production in another. the bacteriocin-enhancing system described in this study could be effectively used to control the growth of other micro-organisms (sensitive cells) in food systems. moreover, this enhancement of bacteriocin production can be applied usefully in industrial production of natural food preservatives.

TI  == growth of yeasts, lactic and acetic acid bacteria in palm wine during tapping and fermentation from felled oil palm (elaeis guineensis) in ghana.
AB  == aim: to investigate the microbiological and biochemical changes which occur in palm wine during the tapping of felled oil palm trees. methods and results: microbiological and biochemical contents of palm wine were determined during the  tapping of felled oil palm trees for 5 weeks and also during the storage. saccharomyces cerevisiae dominated the yeast biota and was the only species isolated in the mature samples. lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides were the dominated lactic acid bacteria, whilst acetic acid bacteria were isolated only after the third day when levels of alcohol had become substantial. the ph, lactic and acetic acid concentrations during the tapping were among 3.5-4.0%, 0.1-0.3% and 0.2-0.4% respectively, whilst the alcohol contents of samples collected within the day were between 1.4% and 2.82%; palm wine which had accumulated over night, 3.24% to 4.75%; and palm wine held for 24  h, over 7.0%. conclusion: accumulation of alcohol in palm wine occurs in three stages during the tapping and marketing with the concurrent lactic and acetic acid fermentation taking place as well. significance and impact of the study: yeasts, lactic and acetic acid bacteria are all important in the fermentation of  palm wine and influence the composition of the product.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rdna-based methods.
AB  == aim: to determine the lactic acid bacteria (lab) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. methods and results: a total of  18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. in all, 387 colonies growing on de man, rogosa and sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (isr), isr-restriction fragment length  polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis profiles as lactobacillus (37%), leuconostoc (43%), carnobacterium (11%), enterococcus (4%) and lactococcus (2%). leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. the analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in lab populations in both products and showed that leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. conclusions: our results pointed to leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. significance and impact of the study: prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by pcr).

TI  == characterisation and biochemical properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermenting cassava for selection as starter cultures.
AB  == a total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in south africa, benin, kenya and germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and  genotypic tests. these could be divided into five main groups comprising strains  of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative  rods, in decreasing order of predominance. most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant  bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. the next predominant group of  lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus lactobacillus or weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera weissella or leuconostoc. homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and h(2)o(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. a total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-pcr fingerprinting in combination with 16s rrna sequencing of representative rep-pcr cluster isolates.  of these strains, 18 were identified as l. plantarum, four as lactobacillus pentosus, two each as leuconostoc fallax, weissella paramesenteroides and lactobacillus fermentum, one each as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the l. plantarum-group. these strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using rapd-pcr with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for gari production.

TI  == enzymatic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cornetto di matera sourdoughs.
AB  == forty-one strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from cornetto di matera  sourdoughs were screened for their enzymatic activities, to elucidate their possible roles during the fermentation process. urease, peptidase, phytase, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically  using synthetic substrates. proteolytic activities were examined in model doughs, using neutral and acidified sterile doughs as controls. all strains had low urease, glutamyl aminopeptidase and iminopeptidase activities, whereas differences within species were observed for the other enzymatic activities. leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus curvatus strains generally showed high aminopeptidase, x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, while the enzymatic activities of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and weissella cibaria varied between strains. in order to  classify the strains on the basis of similar enzymatic profiles, a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out. several strains of l. plantarum, l. curvatus and leuc. mesenteroides showed an interesting combination of proteolytic, peptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, suggesting their possible usefulness as a mixed starter culture in bread-making processes.

TI  == intraspecific diversity of lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, and leuconostoc mesenteroides associated with vacuum-packed  meat product spoilage analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr.
AB  == the intraspecific diversity of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus plantarum was analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr with universal primers m13 and t3. the study included 100 reference strains and 210 isolates recovered from two vacuum-packed  spanish meat products, fiambre de magro adobado and morcilla, previously identified by rdna-restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles. the rapd-m13 profiles identified isolates at species level in l. plantarum and l. mesenteroides, while rapd-t3 provided profiles in l. sakei. the combination of rapd-m13 and rapd-t3 fingerprints revealed a total of 17 profiles in l. mesenteroides, 6 in l. sakei, 12 in l. plantarum, and 6 in l. curvatus. of these, six profiles corresponding to l. mesenteroides and one corresponding to l. sakei  were found in both products. the shannon-weaver diversity index (h'), calculated  according to rapd-m13 and rapd-t3 profiles during storage, revealed that most profiles appeared only in single samplings in both products, indicating a high strain substitution rate during chilled storage of vacuum-packed meat products. when bloating appeared, only one profile corresponding to l. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was present throughout the storage period.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterization of islpl4, a functional insertion sequence in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a lactobacillus plantarum strain, cect 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. the prototype copy (lp1) of this insertion sequence (named islpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with is982 family transposases. perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. the islpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the cect 4645 strain. this finding strongly supports our hypothesis that islpl4 is a  functional element in l. plantarum. some of these elements may be cryptic, since  point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. islpl4 copies have been detected in leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus  oeni, and lactobacillus sakei. an islpl4 copy of o. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among is.

AB  == in this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. strains were first tested  on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. in total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. however, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, l. monocytogenes, b. thermosphacta and leuc. mesenteroides. finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. all 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing  lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin s producing lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. the 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. all strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees c from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing l. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. as the  glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying ph decrease. cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13e, 10a, 14a (all three identified as l. sakei subsp. carnosus by sds-page) and with strains l. sakei 148 (ls5) and l. sakei subsp. carnosus saga 777 (ls8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees c. therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == detection of leuconostoc strains at a meat processing plant using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == to simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers specific for leuconostoc from 16s rrna gene sequences. these primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, lact. sake, lact. fermentum, lact. acidophilus and weissella viridescens. pcr with this primer detected all leuconostoc species tested (leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, leu. pseudomesenteroides, leu. carnosum, leu. lactic, leu. citreum, leu. amelibiosum, leu. gelidum), except for leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. the method could identify areas contaminated with leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of lab producing dextran) and pcr, whereas 29 were negative according to both. six samples were culture-negative but positive by pcr. no false negative results were generated by pcr. the method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.

TI  == souring and breakdown of cyanogenic glucosides during the processing of cassava into akyeke.
AB  == the population and composition of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota as well as  the content of cyanogenic glucosides occurring at various stages of fermentation  and subsequent processing of cassava roots into akyeke, a steamed sour cassava meal, were investigated. the number of lactic acid bacteria and percentage titratable acidity increased during 5 days of fermentation, but decreases were observed in the subsequent operations of 'washing' the dough with water followed  by partial drying and steaming. in field and laboratory samples, lactobacillus plantarum accounted for 59.3% and 52.3%, lactobacillus brevis 23.3% and 22.8% and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris 14.5% and 15.8%, respectively, of all lactic acid bacteria isolated at various stages of fermentation and processing. a reduction of about 98% occurred in the total cyanogens (cn) content of cassava roots during processing, from 69.3 to 1.4 and 110.3 to 2.8 mg cn equivalent/kg dry weight for laboratory and field samples of akyeke, respectively.

TI  == production of phenyllactic acid by lactic acid bacteria: an approach to the selection of strains contributing to food quality and preservation.
AB  == the ability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to produce phenyllactic (pla) and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic (oh-pla) acids, metabolites involved in food quality and preservation, has been evaluated by hplc analysis in 29 lab strains belonging to  12 species widely used in the production of fermented foods. metabolite production was demonstrated for all strains of the species lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus hilgardii, leuconostoc citreum, and for some strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acidophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. strains were distinguished by analysis of variance in three groups including 15 strains that produced both metabolites (0.16-0.46 mm pla and 0.07-0.29 mm oh-pla), five strains accumulating in culture  only pla (0.17-0.57 mm) and nine non-producer strains (< or = 0.10 mm pla and < or = 0.02 mm oh-pla). improvement of phenyllactic acid production was obtained in a selected l. plantarum strain by increasing the concentration of phenylalanine in culture and using low amounts of tyrosine.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == bacterial community structure and location in stilton cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity occurring in stilton cheese was evaluated by 16s ribosomal dna analysis with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. dna templates for pcr experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as  bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. the variable v3 and v4-v5 regions of the 16s genes were analyzed. closest relatives of lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus equorum, and staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the dgge fragments. fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of stilton cheese was checked in fish experiments carried out with reference cultures. the combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe eub338 in fish experiments on stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix.  microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies  within the core. lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. the combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. the differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.

TI  == rope-producing strains of bacillus spp. from wheat bread and strategy for their control by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == two types of white wheat bread (high- and low-type loaves) were investigated for  rope spoilage. thirty of the 56 breads tested developed rope spoilage within 5 days; the high-type loaves were affected by rope spoilage more than the low-type  loaves. sixty-one bacillus strains were isolated from ropy breads and were characterized on the basis of their phenotypic and genotypic traits. all of the isolates were identified as bacillus subtilis by biochemical tests, but molecular assays (randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr assay, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and sequencing of the v3 region of 16s ribosomal dna) revealed greater bacillus species variety in ropy breads. in fact, besides strains of b. subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus cereus, and isolates of  bacillus clausii and bacillus firmus were also identified. all of the ropy bacillus isolates exhibited amylase activity, whereas only 32.4% of these isolates were able to produce ropiness in bread slices after treatment at 96 degrees c for 10 min. strains of lactic acid bacteria previously isolated from sourdough were first selected for antirope activity on bread slices and then used as starters for bread-making experiments. prevention of growth of approximately 10(4) rope-producing b. subtilis g1 spores per cm(2) on bread slices for more than 15 days was observed when heat-treated cultures of lactobacillus plantarum e5 and leuconostoc mesenteroides a27 were added. growth of b. subtilis g1 occurred after 7 days in breads started with saccharomyces cerevisiae t22, l. plantarum e5, and l. mesenteroides a27.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == dynamics of the microbial community responsible for traditional sour cassava starch fermentation studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative rrna hybridization.
AB  == the microbial community developing during the spontaneous fermentation of sour cassava starch was investigated by cultivation-independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partially amplified 16s rdna followed by sequencing of the most intense bands showed that the dominant organisms were all  lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly close relatives of bifidobacterium minimum, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus sp., enterococcus saccharolyticus and lactobacillus plantarum., close relatives of lb. panis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and ln. citreum were also found. a complementary analysis using hybridization of  16s rrna with phylogenetic probes was necessary to detect the presence of the recently discovered species lb. manihotivorans. although it represented up to 13% of the total lactic acid bacteria of sour cassava starch, this species could not  be detected by dgge as the pcr product migrated to the same position as lc. lactis. in addition, it was shown that a strong ph decrease in the time course of fermentation was most probably responsible for the competitive selection of acid-resistant lab vs. both homo and heterofermentative acid-sensitive lab.

TI  == selection and characterization of mixed starter cultures for lactic acid fermentation of carrot, cabbage, beet and onion vegetable mixtures.
AB  == an evaluation of various lactic acid bacteria (lab) for the fermentation of cabbage, carrot and beet-based vegetable products was carried out. as part of a screening process, the growth of 15 cultures in a vegetable juice medium (vjm) was characterized by automated spectrophotometry. acidification patterns as well  as viability during storage of the lab were also established. there were greater  differences between the pure cultures than the mixed ones with respect to growth  in vjm and viability during storage. reductions in viable cell counts during storage of the fermented vjm occurred more rapidly with a leuconostoc strain than for pediococci or lactobacilli. inoculation of vegetables was carried out with cultures of lactobacillus plantarum nk-312, pediococcus acidilactici aferm 772 and leuconostoc mesenteroides blac which were rehydrated in a brine. this rehydration procedure was not detrimental to viability. during fermentation of a  carrot/cabbage vegetable mix, sugar metabolism was characterized by the assimilation of both glucose and fructose, but sugars remained in the fermented vegetables when acidification stopped. the ph in the lab-inoculated vegetables after 72 h at 20 degrees c was significantly lower (by 0.2 units) than the uninoculated control. inoculation with lab designed for silage fermentation resulted in the inhibition of acetic acid production, and reduced the production  of ethanol during fermentation. the selection process on vjm enabled the preparation of a mixed culture that was more rapid than the silage inoculants in  acidifying the medium and was more effective in reducing the production of gas during the fermentation and storage of the fermented vegetables.

TI  == molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (colombia).
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. these products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical  phenotypic and biochemical tests. in the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rrna phylogenetic probes and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (lb. manihotivorans, lb. plantarum, lb. casei, lb. hilgardii, lb. buchneri, lb. fermentum, ln. mesenteroides and pediococcus sp.). however, the most frequently isolated species were lb. plantarum and lb. manihotivorans. the rapd analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between lb. manihotivorans or lb. plantarum  strains. these results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. we propose that the presence of the amylolytic lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.

TI  == degradation of cyanogenic glycosides by lactobacillus plantarum strains from spontaneous cassava fermentation and other microorganisms.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, candida tropicalis and penicillium sclerotiorum were screened for 19 enzymatic activities using the  commercial kit api zym (bio merieux). this activity was compared to the ability of degrading the toxic cyanogenic glycosides amygdalin, linamarin, and linseed cyanogens (a mixture of linustatin and neolinustatin). good correlation between the beta-glucosidase activity found in the api zym screening and the ability to degrade the cyanogenic glycosides was found for the first three species mentioned. p. sclerotiorum strains exhibited very high activity in the api zym test (substrate: 6-br-2-naphthyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside), but proved unable to degrade any of the cyanogenic substrates. among the seven strains of l. plantarum tested, a great variation was seen in the beta-glucosidase activity as well as in the ability to degrade the cyanogens. this was also the case for the strains of c. tropicalis. however, all the glucosidase positive strains of these species were also able to degrade all of the cyanogens tested and at approximately the same rate. a co-culture of the most active strain of l. plantarum and c. tropicalis seemed to degrade linamarin faster than the mono cultures. l. plantarum lpi (originally isolated from fermented cassava) was investigated in further detail. the hydrolytic activity of this strain was intracellular or cell  bound, and beta-bis-glycosides such as amygdalin were hydrolysed by a two-stage sequential mechanism as follows: (1) amygdalin to prunasin and (2) prunasin to cyanohydrin. finally, inoculation of extracted linseed meal (containing linustatin and neolinustatin) with l. plantarum lpi resulted in hydrolysis of the glycosides.

AB  == arctic charr, salvelinus alpinus (l.), held in fresh water, were fed four experimental diets containing different polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa). in addition, one group fed a diet containing only coconut oil as sole lipid source served as control. the population of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria associated with the epithelial mucosa and the faecalia was estimated using the dilution plate technique. generally, the population level of adherent bacteria increased along the digestive tract (stomach, small intestine and large intestine). adherent gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria seemed to be present at equal levels in all parts of the alimentary tract. lactic acid bacteria dominated among the gram-positive bacteria, and they were detected in all regions of fish fed the pufa supplemented diets. the frequency of lactic acid bacteria was highest in the digestive tract of fish fed diets with added 7.0% linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) or 4% of a pufa mix. a lower frequency of lactic acid bacteria was found in fish fed dietary linoleic acid (18:2 n-6), and they were absent or present in low numbers  in fish fed the coconut oil diet. it is suggested that dietary fatty acids affect the attachment sites for the gastrointestinal microbiota, possibly by modifying the fatty acid composition of the intestine wall. numerical taxonomy procedures showed that the lactic acid bacteria carnobacterium spp. and a carnobacterium piscicola-like strain were predominant, with smaller numbers of lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus spp. and leuconostoc mesenteroides present. seven strains of carnobacterium spp. were further identified on the basis of 16s rdna sequence analysis, and all these strains were identified as carnobacterium piscicola.

TI  == isolation and characterization of pediocin ach chimeric protein mutants with altered bactericidal activity.
AB  == a collection of pediocin ach amino acid substitution mutants was generated by pcr random mutagenesis of dna encoding the bacteriocin. mutants were isolated by cloning mutagenized dna into an escherichia coli male plasmid that directs the secretion of maltose binding protein-pediocin ach chimeric proteins and by screening transformant colonies for bactericidal activity against lactobacillus plantarum ncdo955 (k. w. miller, r. schamber, y. chen, and b. ray, 1998. appl. environ. microbiol. 64:14-20, 1998). in all, 17 substitution mutants were isolated at 14 of the 44 amino acids of pediocin ach. seven mutants (n5k, c9r, c14s, c14y, g37e, g37r, and c44w) were completely inactive against the pediocin ach-sensitive strains l. plantarum ncdo955, listeria innocua lin11, enterococcus  faecalis m1, pediococcus acidilactici lb42, and leuconostoc mesenteroides ly. a c24s substitution mutant constructed by other means also was inactive against these bacteria. nine other mutants (k1n, w18r, i26t, m31t, a34d, n41k, h42l, k43n, and k43e) retained from <1% to approximately 60% of wild-type activity when assayed against l. innocua lin11. one mutant, k11e, displayed approximately 2. 8-fold-higher activity against this indicator. about one half of the mutations mapped to amino acids that are conserved in the pediocin-like family of bacteriocins. all four cysteines were found to be required for activity, although only c9 and c14 are conserved among pediocin-like bacteriocins. several basic amino acids as well as nonpolar amino acids located within the hydrophobic c-terminal region also were found to be important. the mutations are discussed in the context of structural models that have been proposed for the bacteriocin.

TI  == effects of the kinetics of water potential variation on bacteria viability.
AB  == the effect of the kinetics of water potential variation (psi) on the viability of bacteria subjected to hyperosmotic stresses in water-glycerol solution was studied. the three bacteria used were lactobacillus plantarum l-73, leuconostoc mesenteroides lm057 and escherichia coli tg1. these strains were submitted to a final water potential of -107.2 mpa, -170.9 mpa and/or -244.7 mpa. in any case the kinetics of water potential variation was found to have a great effect on the cell viability. the application of slow water potential decreases could maintain  an important cell viability (about 80-100%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change for the same final water potential  (15-57%). for each strain tested, an optimal dehydration kinetics was determined  which depended on the final water potential. the existence of this optimum could  be explained thanks to the opposition of two actions affecting cell viability: a  positive action relative to the slowness of the water potential variation and a negative action relative to the residence time of cells in a critical range of water potential.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical characterization of cassava retting, a traditional lactic acid fermentation for foo-foo (cassava flour) production.
AB  == the overall kinetics of retting, a spontaneous fermentation of cassava roots performed in central africa, was investigated in terms of microbial-population evolution and biochemical and physicochemical parameters. during the traditional  process, endogenous cyanogens were almost totally degraded, plant cell walls were lysed by the simultaneous action of pectin methylesterase and pectate lyase, and  organic acids (c(inf2) to c(inf4)) were produced. most microorganisms identified  were found to be facultative anaerobes which used the sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) present in the roots as carbon sources. after 24 h of retting, the  fermentation reached an equilibrium that was reproducible in all the spontaneous  fermentations studied. lactic acid bacteria were largely predominant (over 99% of the total flora after 48 h) and governed the fermentation. the epiphytic flora was first replaced by lactococcus lactis, then by leuconostoc mesenteroides, and  finally, at the end of the process, by lactobacillus plantarum. these organisms produced ethanol and high concentrations of lactate, which strongly acidified the retting juice. in addition, the rapid decrease in partial oxygen pressure rendered the process anaerobic. strict anaerobes, such as clostridium spp., developed and produced the volatile fatty acids (mainly butyrate) responsible, together with lactate, for the typical flavor of retted cassava. yeasts (mostly candida spp.) did not seem to play a significant role in the process, but their increasing numbers in the last stage of the process might influence the flavor and the preservation of the end products.

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima.
AB  == the souring of cassava dough during fermentation into the fermented cassava meal, agbelima, was investigated. four different types of traditional inocula were used to ferment the dough and increases in titrable acidity expressed as lactic acid from 0.31-0.38 to 0.78-0.91% (w/w) confirmed the fermentation to be a process of  acidification. the microflora of all inocula and fermenting dough contained high  counts of lactic acid bacteria, 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g in all inocula and 10(7)-10(8), 10(8)-10(9) and 10(9) cfu/g at 0, 24 and 48 h in all fermentations. lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during all types of fermentation accounting for 51% of 171 representative isolates taken from various stages of fermentation. other major lactic acid bacteria found were lactobacillus brevis, 16%, leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15% and some cocci including streptococcus spp. whose numbers decreased with fermentation time. the lactic acid bacteria were responsible for the souring of agbelima through the production of lactic acid. all l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. mesenteroides isolates examined demonstrated linamarase as well as other enzymatic activities but did not possess tissue degrading enzymes like cellulase, pectin esterase and polygalacturonase. the aroma profile of agbelima did not vary with the type of inoculum used and in all samples the build-up of aroma compounds were dominated by a non-identified low molecular weight alcohol, 1-propanol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetoin. substantial reductions occurred in the levels of cyanogenic compounds present in cassava during fermentation into agbelima and detoxification was enhanced by the use of inoculum.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

AB  == the uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. these strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. saccharomyces cerevisiae (p6), candida guilliermondii (p40), lactobacillus plantarum (b31 and la18) and l. brevis (b21)  showed good performance, while sacch. fructuum (p43), l. cellobiosus (b37) and enterococcus faecium (b11) yielded bread of lower quality. leuconostoc mesenteroides (b10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. all yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. sacch. cerevisiae, leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. brevis and l. plantarum (b31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. for all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. the highest specific activities were  found for sacch. cerevisiae, c. guilliermondii and l. plantarum (b31). these results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.

AB  == most species of lactic acid bacteria decarboxylate l-malate to lactate and co(2)  if an energy source such as glucose is present. a proton is taken up in the reaction, which prevents ph decreases in the growth medium caused by lactic acid  production from glucose fermentation. mrs broth (ph 7.0) (difco laboratories) containing 10 mm glucose and various concentrations of l-malate (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mm) was used to cultivate lactobacillus plantarum. after 72 h at 37 degrees c, all malate was decarboxylated and all glucose was fermented, with resultant final ph values of 4.5, 6.3, 6.9, 7.3, and 7.5, respectively. when d-malate (which cannot be decarboxylated) was substituted for l-malate, the final ph values were 4.5, 5.2, 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9. by varying the ratios of glucose to l-malate in the growth medium, it was possible to obtain ph values which were lower, the same, or higher than the initial ph values. in contrast, buffers such  as phosphate only retard decreases in ph. l-malate, when compared with k(2)po(4)  on an equal molar basis, provided greater resistance to decreases in ph. higher specific growth rates were observed for l. plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides when l-malate rather than k(2)po(4) was incorporated into the growth medium.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == microbial changes in sweet sorghum (sorghum bicolor) juices.
AB  == juice freshly expressed from sorghum bicolor for making sweet sorghum syrup contained 10 microorganisms per ml. the dominant bacterium was leuconostoc mesenteroides, followed by gram-negative rods. lactobacilli, yeasts, and nonfecal coliform bacteria each comprised about 1% of the microbial population. spoilage of juice, manifested by a sour odor, discoloration, and foaming, occurred between 5 and 12 h at ambient temperatures. spoilage was correlated with a drop in ph from 4.9 to 4.5 l. mesenteroides was the dominant spoiling agent at 20 degrees c, and lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant spoiling agent at 32 degrees c, as determined by pure culture studies. juice may be stored for 14 days at 4 degrees  c if promptly refrigerated.

TI  == influence of sodium nitrite, temperature, and lactic acid bacteria on the growth  of brochothrix thermosphacta under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == in commercial vacuum-packed bologna, growth of brochothrix thermosphacta was limited at 5 degrees c during a 4-week storage period. factors controlling the growth of this organism were associated in part with certain lactobacilli isolated from the meat. the lactic acid bacteria associated with the decline of b. thermosphacta and overall spoilage of vacuum-packed bologna were isolated and  identified. the principal organisms were lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus viridescens, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and certain streptococci. in associated growth experiments with b. thermosphacta at 5 and 15 degrees c, l. brevis and l. plantarum showed the greatest antagonism towards the brochothrix species. studies with changes in incubation temperatures (5 or 15 degrees c) or nitrite levels (0-50 microgram/ml) indicated that these two factors influence the antagonism but were minor compared with the influence of the lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == determination of the isotope distribution in malate-14c with fumarase-negative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == no fumarase activity could be found in whole cells or in cell-free crude extracts from leuconostoc mesenteroides or lactobacillus curvatus. the degradation of l-malate-4-14c by these organisms yielded more than 95% of the label as 14co2. it is therefore recommended that these organisms, rather than lactobacillus plantarum, should be used in the determination of isotope distribution in l-malate-14c, since l. plantarum exhibits a significant fumarase activity and thus randomizes malate prior to the decarboxylation of this substance by the malolactic enzyme.

TI  == nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-independent lactate dehydrogenases in homofermentative and heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == three homofermentative (lactobacillus plantarum b38, l. plantarum b33, pediococcus pentosaceus b30) and three heterofermentative (leuconostoc mesenteroides 39, l. oenos b70, lactobacillus brevis) lactic acid bacteria were examined for the presence or absence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad)-dependent and nad-independent d- and l-lactate dehydrogenases. two of the six strains investigated, p. pentosaceus and l. oenos, did not exhibit an nad-independent enzyme activity capable of reducing dichlorophenol indophenol. the ph optima of the lactic dehydrogenases were determined. the nad-dependent enzymes from homofermentative strains exhibited optima at ph 7.8 to 8.8, whereas  values from 9.0 to 10.0 were noted for these enzymes from heterofermentative organisms. the optima for the nad-independent enzymes were between 5.8 and 6.6. the apparent michaelis-menten constants determined for both nad and the substrates demonstrated the existence of a greater affinity for d- than l-lactic  acid. a comparison of the specific nad-dependent and nad-independent lactate dehydrogenase activities revealed a direct correlation of the d/l ratios of these activities with the type of lactic acid produced during the growth of the organism.

TI  == fermentation of philippine vegetable blends.
AB  == seven blends of philipphine vegetables, two of which contained soybeans and one mongo bean sprouts, were prepared for fermentation and study of microbiological and chemical changes. the fermentations were typical lactic acid bacterial fermentations, initiated by leuconostoc mesenteroides and continued by lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus cerevisiae, and l. plantarum. the combination of high acidity and low ph resembled other vegetable fermentations, such as sauerkraut. the procedure offers a method of preserving surplus vegetables, and,  in addition, a method for incorporating and preserving the high-protein-containing soybeans.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial fermentation of burong dalag.
AB  == the fermented food, burong dalag, prepared in many filipino homes, was studied to determine the nature of the microbiological and chemical changes that occur during fermentation. this is a lactic acid bacterial fermentation in which the species leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus cerevisiae, and lactobacillus plantarum played the major acid-producing role. the ph was lowered to below 4.0,  and about 0.9% acid as lactic acid was attained in 1 week. it was essential to keep the product covered well to exclude air and subsequent growth of yeasts and  mold.

TI  == lactobacilli on plants.
AB  == the distribution, enumeration, and identification of lactobacilli on vegetable plants were studied in an area described geographically as being subtropical and  moist. the lactobacilli were obtained, by means of quantitative enrichment procedures in rogosa's sl broth, from 35.3% of all samples incubated at 32 c, and from 15.4% of the samples incubated at 45 c. less than 10 lactobacilli/g of plant material were enumerated in 54% of all positive samples. the lactobacilli were found much less frequently and in lower numbers than were streptococci or leuconostoc mesenteroides. the most frequently isolated lactobacillus was very simular to, but not identical with, lactobacillus fermenti. it was aerogenic, grew well at both 15 and 45 c, fermented arabinose, lactose, and sucrose, and liberated ammonia from arginine. of the identified species, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, and l. brevis were the most frequently isolated, whereas l. casei, l. viridescens, l. cellobiosus, l. salivarius, and l. buchneri were obtained from small numbers of samples. the widespread but sporadic distribution of lactobacilli in low numbers seems to indicate that these organisms do not normally thrive on plant surfaces. a ternary cycle, beginning with intestinal waste, followed by mechanical distribution to and among plants, and return to the host via the oral cavity, is suggested.

TI  == occurrence of an inhibitor of lactic acid bacteria in green olives.
AB  == green olives were found to contain an inhibitor(s) of several species of lactic acid bacteria usually associated with the spanish-type brined olive fermentation. the inhibitor was demonstrated by the presence of inhibition zones surrounding tissue which had been cut from frozen olives and implanted in a seeded nutritive  agar medium. relative potencies of aqueous extracts of frozen olives were determined by a paper disc assay method. the mission variety of olive contained the most inhibitor, and the manzanillo and ascolano, about 50 and 40% as much as  the mission variety, respectively. sevillano and barouni varieties contained comparatively little inhibitor. effects of the inhibitor on growth rates of lactic acid bacteria were determined by adding various amounts of a concentrated  aqueous extract of olives to a nutritive broth medium contained in screw-capped tubes. of the four species of lactic acid bacteria tested, leuconostoc mesenteroides was the most sensitive, and lactobacillus plantarum was the least sensitive; pediococcus cerevisiae and lactobacillus brevis were intermediate in sensitivity. extracts possessed a bactericidal property, as evidenced by their effect on l. mesenteroides. sodium chloride, especially at concentrations of about 5% and higher, greatly increased the effectiveness of the inhibitor. the inhibitor was ethyl alcohol-soluble and was stable when heated at 100 c in aqueous solution. potencies of extracts were reduced greatly by adjustment to ph  10, but no appreciable effect was noted by adjustment to ph 0.8.

TI  == pure culture fermentation of green olives.
AB  == the method previously developed by us for the pure-culture fermentation of brined cucumbers and other vegetables has been applied successfully to manzanillo variety olives. field-run grade fruit was processed first by conventional procedures to remove most of the bitterness. then the relative abilities of lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, pediococcus cerevisiae, and leuconostoc mesenteroides to become established and produce acid in both heat-shocked (74 c for 3 min) and unheated olives, brined at 4.7 to 5.9% nacl (w/v basis), were evaluated. the heat-shock treatment not only proved effective in ridding the fruit of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining and inoculation, but also made the olives highly fermentable with respect to growth and acid production by the introduced culture, particularly l.  plantarum. of the four species used as inocula, l. plantarum was by far the most  vigorous in fermentation ability. it consistently produced the highest levels of  brine acidity (1.0 to 1.2% calculated as lactic acid) and the lowest ph values (3.8 to 3.9) during the fermentation of heat-shocked olives. also, l. plantarum completely dominated fermentations when used in two-species (with p. cerevisiae)  and three-species (with p. cerevisiae and l. brevis) combinations as inocula. in  contrast, when l. plantarum was inoculated into the brines of unheated olives it  failed to become properly established; the same was true for the other species tested, but even to a more pronounced degree. l. brevis was the only species used that failed to develop in brines of both heat-shocked and unheated olives. modification of the curing brine by the addition of lactic acid at the outset, either with or without dextrose, led to a much earlier onset of fermentation with accompanying acid development, as compared to treatments with dextrose alone or nonadditive controls. reasons for the marked improvement of the fermentability of manzanillo olives receiving the prebrining heat-shock treatment are discussed.

TI  == nature of the lipids of some lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == ikawa, miyoshi (university of california, berkeley). nature of the lipids of some lactic acid bacteria. j. bacteriol. 85:772-781. 1963.-lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus cerevisiae, and streptococcus faecalis were grown on a lipid-free medium, and the amounts of acetone-soluble lipids, acetone-insoluble phospholipids, and unextracted or bound lipid in the cells were estimated. neutral glycerides appeared to be absent, or present only in traces, in l. casei and s. faecalis. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides, and p. cerevisiae, in addition to containing glycerides, appeared to contain glycolipids of glucose and galactose. glycerol was present in the phospholipid fraction of all the organisms, and, in addition, galactose was present in l. mesenteroides. paper chromatography of hydrolysates of the phospholipid fractions showed the absence of the usual phospholipid nitrogen bases, serine, ethanolamine, and choline, in these organisms. microbiological assays of lyophilized unextracted cells for myo-inositol and choline also showed that lipids containing these components occurred in very small amounts at most. the principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the phospholipid fraction of l. casei, l. plantarum, p. cerevisiae, and s. faecalis was lysine, which seemed to be exclusively of the l configuration. the principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the l. mesenteroides phospholipid fraction was d-alanine. these amino acids appeared to be bound in components of the phospholipid fraction and not free.
