TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == mitigation of methane production from cattle by feeding cashew nut shell liquid.
AB  == the effects of cashew nut shell liquid (cnsl) feeding on methane production and rumen fermentation were investigated by repeatedly using 3 holstein nonlactating  cows with rumen fistulas. the cows were fed a concentrate and hay diet (6:4 ratio) for 4 wk (control period) followed by the same diet with a cnsl-containing pellet for the next 3 wk (cnsl period). two trials were conducted using cnsl pellets blended with only silica (trial 1) or with several other ingredients (trial 2). each pellet type was fed to cows to allow cnsl intake at 4 g/100 kg of body weight per day. methane production was measured in a respiration chamber system, and energy balance, nutrient digestibility, and rumen microbial changes were monitored. methane production per unit of dry matter intake decreased by 38.3 and 19.3% in cnsl feeding trials 1 and 2, respectively. energy loss as methane emission decreased from 9.7 to 6.1% (trial 1) and from 8.4 to 7.0% (trial 2) with cnsl feeding, whereas the loss to feces (trial 1) and heat production (trial 2) increased. retained energy did not differ between the control and cnsl  periods. digestibility of dry matter and gross energy decreased with cnsl feeding in trial 1, but did not differ in trial 2. feeding cnsl caused a decrease in acetate and total short-chain fatty acid levels and an increase in propionate proportion in both trials. relative copy number of methyl coenzyme-m reductase subunit a gene and its expression decreased with cnsl feeding. the relative abundance of fibrolytic or formate-producing species such as ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and treponema bryantii decreased, but species related to propionate production, including prevotella ruminicolla, selenomonas ruminantium, anaerovibrio lipolytica, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, increased. if used in a suitable formulation, cnsl acts as a potent methane-inhibiting and propionate-enhancing agent through the alteration of rumen microbiota without adversely affecting feed digestibility.

TI  == rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  == high-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. this adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the  rumen. therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to  a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. the rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, 16s rrna gene libraries, and quantitative real-time pcr. the t-rflp analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. the 16s rrna gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. the 16s rrna gene libraries of  hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to  the phylum fibrobacteres, whereas the 16s rrna gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes. real-time pcr analysis detected significant fold increases  in the megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, and prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. this study evaluates the rumen microbial population using  several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == the characterization of lactic acid producing bacteria from the rumen of dairy cattle grazing on improved pasture supplemented with wheat and barley grain.
AB  == aims: to identify and characterize the major lactic acid bacteria in the rumen of dairy cattle grazing improved pasture of rye grass and white clover and receiving a maize silage and grain supplement with and without virginiamycin. methods and results: eighty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from the rumen of 16 holstein-friesian dairy cows. the isolates were initially grouped on the basis of their gram morphology and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the pcr amplified 16s rdna. a more definitive analysis was undertaken by comparing the 16s rdna sequences. many of the isolates were closely related to other previously characterized rumen bacteria, including streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus vitulinus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella bryantii and selenomonas ruminantium. the in vitro production of l- and/or d-lactate was seen  with all but five of the isolates examined, many of which were also resistant to  virginiamycin. conclusion: supplementation of grain with virginiamycin may reduce the risk of acidosis but does not prevent its occurrence in dairy cattle grazing  improved pasture. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that lactic acid production is caused, not only by various thoroughly researched types of bacteria, but also by others previously identified in the rumen but not further characterized.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == the effect of condensed tannins from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == application of flow cytometry for ecological monitoring of the rumen microbial ecosystem.
AB  == flow cytometry in combination with fluorescently labeled ribosomal rna oligonucleotide probes was used for enumeration and monitoring of ruminal bacteria. the polyanionic azo dye trypan blue was used for discrimination between live bacterial cells and inorganic particles and the separation was further improved by lysozyme treatment and sonication. cy3-labeled universally conserved  probe eub338 and fitc-labeled prevotella bryantii specific probe pbb14 were used  for in situ hybridization in mixed culture experiments and in samples of crude rumen fluid. the results were analyzed by flow cytometry. the separation of p. bryantii and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, another ruminal bacterium, in mixed culture experiments was satisfactory and enabled monitoring of these bacteria in  a test system. p. bryantii cells were detected in crude rumen fluid samples only  after supplementation with pure culture cells; this implicates a low concentration of p. bryantii cells in vivo (less than 100/nl, i.e. 10(5) per ml).
