TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == lateral gene transfer of streptococcal ice element rd2 (region of difference 2) encoding secreted proteins.
AB  == background: the genome of serotype m28 group a streptococcus (gas) strain mgas6180 contains a novel genetic element named region of difference 2 (rd2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. rd2 is present in all serotype m28 strains and strains of several other gas serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. we show here that the gas rd2 element is present in strain mgas6180 both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. rd2-like regions were identified in publicly available  genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group b streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. ten rd2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ices). results: we transferred rd2 from gas strain mgas6180 (serotype m28) to serotype m1 and m4 gas strains by filter mating. the copy number of the rd2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain mgas6180 with mitomycin c,  a dna damaging agent. using a pcr-based method, we also identified rd2-like regions in multiple group c and g strains of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections. conclusions: taken together, the data indicate that the rd2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == the cell envelope subtilisin-like proteinase is a virulence determinant for streptococcus suis.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that  mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. it has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by s. suis (serotype 2) are potential virulence determinants. in the present study, we screened a s. suis mutant library created by the insertion of tn917 transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. we characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor. results: two mutants (g6g and m3g) possessing a single tn917 insertion were isolated. the affected gene coded for a protein (ssu0757) that shared a high degree of identity with streptococccus thermophilus prts (95.9%) and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus agalactiae cspa (49.5%), which are cell surface serine proteinases. the ssu0757 protein had a calculated molecular mass of 169.6 kda and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif i (asp200), motif ii (his239), and motif iii (ser568). ssu0757 also had the gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (leu-pro-x-thr-gly) at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. all the s. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the ssu0757 protein. the two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain p1/7. the virulence of the g6g and m3g mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the cd1 mouse model. significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the p1/7 group and the m3g and g6g groups (p < 0.001). conclusion: in summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in s. suis. evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in s. suis virulence.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the gdha gene in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: to study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in streptococcus thermophilus. methods and results: analysis of the gdha gene nucleotide sequence  of s. thermophilus cnrz1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. the deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative gdh active site and  some conserved domains characteristic of family i of hexameric gdhs. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of s. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus infantarius. studying the structural organization of the gdha locus the amino acid similarity of gdhs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. a dominant transcript of approximately 1.4  kbp was revealed by northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdha mrna is monocystronic. primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdha was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (atg). conclusions: the gdha represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. significance and impact of the study: a deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop s. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a new plasmid pspnp1 from a multidrug-resistant clone of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a novel streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pspnp1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone poland(23f)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pspnp1 is different to pdp1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pst08, a plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus. a double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pc194/pub110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). it also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type a of the streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pmv158/pls1. detection of single-stranded dna by southern blot analysis indicated that pspnp1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of vibrio cholerae. real-time pcr assays revealed that this orf was expressed. hybridization experiments showed that the pspnp1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pspnp1 were able to replicate in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == cse, a chimeric and variable gene, encodes an extracellular protein involved in cellular segregation in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the isolation of a streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 mutant displaying a long-chain phenotype allowed us to identify the cse gene (for cellular segregation). the n terminus of cse exhibits high similarity to streptococcus agalactiae surface immunogenic protein (sip), while its c terminus exhibits high  similarity to s. thermophilus pcsb. in cnrz368, deletion of the entire cse open reading frame leads to drastic lengthening of cell chains and altered colony morphology. complementation of the deltacse mutation with a wild-type allele restored both wild-type phenotypes. the central part of cse is a repeat-rich region with low sequence complexity. comparison of cse from cnrz368 and lmg18311  strains reveals high variability of this repeat-rich region. to assess the impact of this central region variability, the central region of lmg18311 cse was exchanged with that of cnrz368 cse. this replacement did not affect chain length, showing that divergence of the central part does not modify cell segregation activity of cse. the structure of the cse locus suggests that the chimeric organization of cse results from insertion of a duplicated sequence deriving from the pcsb 3' end into an ancestral sip gene. thus, the cse locus illustrates the module-shuffling mechanism of bacterial gene evolution.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == identification and characterization of the eps (exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
