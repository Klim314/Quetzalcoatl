TI  == prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides preference of probiotic bifidobacteria  and antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve 46, bifidobacterium lactis 8:8 and bifidobacterium longum 6:18 and three reference strains b. breve ccug 24611, b. lactis jcm 10602, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 were examined for acid and bile tolerance, prebiotic utilization and antimicrobial activity against four clostridium difficile (cd) strains including the hypervirulent strain, pcr ribotype nap1/027. b. lactis 8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 exhibited a high tolerance in mrsc broth with ph 2.5 for 30 min. b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 remained 100% viable in mrsc broth with 5% porcine bile after 4 h. all six strains showed a high prebiotic degrading ability (prebiotic score) with galactooligosaccharides (gos), isomaltooligosaccharides (imos) and lactulose as carbon sources and moderate degradation of fructooligosaccharides (fos). xylooligosaccharides (xos) was metabolized to a greater extent by b. lactis 8:8,  b. lactis jcm 10602, b. pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 and b. longum 6:18 (prebiotic  score >50%). all strains exhibited extracellular antimicrobial activity (ama) against four cd strains including the cd nap1/027. ama of b. breve 46, b. lactis  8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 strains was mainly ascribed to a combined action of organic acids and heat stable, protease sensitive antimicrobial peptides when cells were grown in mrsc broth with glucose and by acids when grown with five different prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides (ndos). none of c. difficile  strains degraded five prebiotic-ndos. whole cells of b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 and their supernatants inhibited the growth and toxin production of the cd nap1/027 strain.
