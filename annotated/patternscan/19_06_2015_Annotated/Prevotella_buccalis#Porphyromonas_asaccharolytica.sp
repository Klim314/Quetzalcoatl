TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the rapid id 32a system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) for the identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the  bacteroides fragilis group. methods: five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-b. fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested in the rapid id 32a system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. results: the rapid id 32a system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. a further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by  the manufacturer. fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level  only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. three isolates of prevotella were not identified by the system. of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. conclusions: the rapid id 32a system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-b. fragilis group, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. there was poor discrimination between fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum, between porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis, and between prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis. the need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.

TI  == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before  treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci,  staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
