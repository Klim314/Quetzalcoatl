TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == selected adjunct cultures remarkably increase the content of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white brined cheese.
AB  == some lactic acid bacteria strains in milk media are capable of releasing bioactive peptides. in this study, we evaluated the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)inhibitory activity of 180 lactic acid bacteria and selected several lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. casei strains that demonstrated strong ace-inhibitory activity. the aim was to carry out a molecular study on the bioactive peptides released by the strains with the best ace-inhibitory properties and by the strains demonstrating a calcium-binding effect. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bioactive peptides in bulgarian white cheese. peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory activity were purified and sequenced. the strains were assessed for production of peptides with calcium-binding properties. these peptides were isolated, purified  and sequenced. two strains releasing bioactive peptides with the strongest ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding activities were selected for development of cheese starters. the strain with the best ace-inhibitory activity was l. helveticus a1, which releases the peptide ala-leu-pro-met as a main contributor to the ace inhibition. the strain with the best calcium-binding activity was l. casei c3 releasing the peptide splspspspe (fraction 15-20 of ss-casein) as a main contributor to calcium binding. after pilot production of cheeses with the developed starters, the ace-inhibitory and calcium-binding effects were confirmed during the cheese ripening. the addition of the two selected adjunct cultures led to increased production of bioactive peptides in the cheese. in this way, it is possible to increase the functional properties of bulgarian white brined cheese.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == changes of proteolysis and angiotensin-i converting enzyme-inhibitory activity in white-brined cheese as affected by adjunct culture and ripening temperature.
AB  == the effects of use of adjunct cultures (lactobacillus helveticus and lb. casei) and ripening temperatures (6 or 12 degrees c) on proteolysis and angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity in white-brined cheeses were investigated during 120 d ripening. proteolysis was monitored by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-page) and reversed phase-hplc (rp-hplc) of water-insoluble and -soluble fractions of the cheeses, respectively. urea-page patterns of the samples revealed that the intensities of the bands representing casein fractions decreased in the experimental cheeses, being more pronounced in the cheeses made with adjunct cultures. similarly, peptide profiles and the concentrations of individual and total free amino acids were influenced by both the adjunct cultures and ripening temperatures. the ace-inhibitory activity of the water-soluble extracts of the cheeses were higher in the cheeses  made using adjunct cultures (especially lb. helveticus) and ripened at 12 degrees c. the ace-inhibitory activity did not decrease during ripening. the contribution of lb. helveticus to the development of proteolysis and ace-inhibitory peptide activities were higher than that of lb. casei. to conclude, the use of lb. helveticus as adjunct culture in white-brined cheese and ripening at 12 degrees c would be recommended to obtain white-brined cheese with high ace-i-inhibitory peptides activity and higher levels of preoteolysis.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == diversity and dynamic of lactic acid bacteria strains during aging of a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter.
AB  == the aim of this study was to explore diversity and dynamic of indigenous lab strains associated with a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter such as pdo grana padano cheese. samples of milk, curd, natural whey culture and cheeses (2nd, 6th, 9th and 13th months of ripening) were collected from 6 cheese factories in northern italy. dna was extracted from each  sample and from 194 lab isolates. trna(ala)-23s rdna-rflp was applied to identify isolates. strain diversity was assessed by (gtg)5 rep-pcr and rapd(p1)-pcr. finally, culture-independent lh-pcr (v1-v2 16s-rdna), was considered to explore structure and dynamic of the microbiota. grana padano lab were represented mainly by lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus acidilactici, while the structure and dynamic of microbiota at different localities was specific. the strength of this work is to have focused the study on isolates coming from more than one cheese factories rather than a high number of isolates  from one unique production. we provided a valuable insight into inter and intraspecies diversity of typical lab strains during ripening of traditional pdo  grana padano, contributing to the understanding of specific microbial ecosystem of this cheese.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == mitogenic response and probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from indigenously pickled vegetables and fermented beverages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria from indigenous pickled vegetables and fermented beverages (fermented rice and madhuca longifolia flowers) were isolated and investigated for their functional characteristics in vitro as potential new probiotic strains. four isolates (all lactobacillus spp.) selected on the basis of high tolerance to bile (0.2%) were identified by standard and molecular methods (16s rdna) as l. helveticus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii and l. bulgaricus from pickled vegetables and fermented beverages respectively. these selected strains had antibiotic resistance, tolerance to artificial gastric juice and phenol (0.4%), enzymatic profile, and antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens (enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri 2a, listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). all strains survived well in artificial gastric juice at low ph (3.0) values for 4 h, possessed bile salt hydrolase activity and were susceptible to most antibiotics including vancomycin. additionally, the isolates exhibited high tolerance to phenol, high cell surface  hydrophobicity (>60%) and induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. all the four strains of present study suppressed the con a-stimulated proliferation of the mouse spleen cells, although l. casei had the strongest suppressive effect. the results of this study suggest a potential application of the strains (following human clinical trials), for developing probiotic foods.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == characterization of the cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 gene cluster involved in sulfur metabolism in lactobacillus casei.
AB  == the up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. one of the two  open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. the other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. the gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of l. casei atcc 334, bl23 and zhang. apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. rt-pcr was used to  analyze the expression of the gene cluster. additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. the gene cluster cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. in addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in  cell-free extracts disappeared when l. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found  in all studied ctl1(+)l. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in l. helveticus fam2888, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and s. thermophilus fam17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 gene cluster.

TI  == bioconversion of ovine scotta into lactic acid with pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. it is widely produced in southern europe and particularly in italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. with the aim of  evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an  alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed  cultures of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. the outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can  be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to  92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. finally, by using l. casei and s. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure l: -lactic acid can be obtained.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == evolutionary history of the ompr/iiia family of signal transduction two component systems in lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae.
AB  == background: two component systems (tcs) are signal transduction pathways which typically consist of a sensor histidine kinase (hk) and a response regulator (rr). in this study, we have analyzed the evolution of tcs of the ompr/iiia family in lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae, two families belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria (lab). lab colonize nutrient-rich environments such as foodstuffs, plant materials and the gastrointestinal tract of animals thus driving the study of this group of both basic and applied interest. results: the  genomes of 19 strains belonging to 16 different species have been analyzed. the number of tcs encoded by the strains considered in this study varied between 4 in lactobacillus helveticus and 17 in lactobacillus casei. the ompr/iiia family was  the most prevalent in lactobacillaceae accounting for 71% of the tcs present in this group. the phylogenetic analysis shows that no new tcs of this family has recently evolved in these lactobacillaceae by either lineage-specific gene expansion or domain shuffling. furthermore, no clear evidence of non-orthologous  replacements of either rr or hk partners has been obtained, thus indicating that  coevolution of cognate rr and hks has been prevalent in lactobacillaceae. conclusions: the results obtained suggest that vertical inheritance of tcs present in the last common ancestor and lineage-specific gene losses appear as the main evolutionary forces involved in their evolution in lactobacillaceae, although some hgt events cannot be ruled out. this would agree with the genomic analyses of lactobacillales which show that gene losses have been a major trend in the evolution of this group.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == analysis of the microflora in tibetan kefir grains using denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis.
AB  == the microflora of tibetan kefir grains was investigated by culture- independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partially amplified 16s rrna for bacteria and 26s rrna for yeasts, followed by sequencing of the most intense bands, showed that the dominant microorganisms were pseudomonas sp., leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus casei, kazachstania unispora, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and kazachstania exigua. the bacterial communities between three kinds of tibetan kefir grains showed 78-84% similarity, and yeasts 80-92%. the microflora is held  together in the matrix of fibrillar material composed largely of a water-insoluble polysaccharide.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli isolated from two italian hard cheeses.
AB  == one hundred forty-one lactobacilli strains isolated from natural whey starter cultures and ripened grana padano and parmigiano reggiano cheeses were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antibiotics, in particular, penicillin g, ampicillin,  amoxicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, cefuroxime, vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. the  strains belonged to the species lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. casei. the strains of the first two species were isolated from whey starter cultures, and the strains of the last two species were from the ripened cheeses. significant differences among the strains in their antibiotic resistance were found in relation to the type of cheese and, especially, the strains from parmigiano reggiano were more resistant to gentamicin and penicillin g. the strains isolated in the ripened cheese were generally more resistant than those isolated from natural whey starter cultures;  in particular, significant differences regarding oxacillin, vancomycin, cephalotin, and co-trimoxazole were observed. finally, no significant difference  in relation to the type of cheese was found among the thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from whey cultures, while the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli isolated from parmigiano reggiano showed higher resistance toward gentamicin and penicillin g than did the same species isolated from grana padano.

TI  == fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  == a screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (streptococcus thermophilus cr12, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus helveticus pr4, lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory peptides. the fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees c. fermentation of goats' milk  resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of gaba. furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ace-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of gaba and the ace-inhibitory activity. moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.

TI  == identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. the genome database of lactobacillus casei atcc 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. however, several l. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. by applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of l. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of l. casei atcc  334. the presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. moreover, two gene variants were identified. both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity  in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria population in ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese.
AB  == the diversity of dominant lactic acid bacteria population in 12 months ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses was investigated by a polyphasic approach including culture-dependent and independent methods. traditional plating, isolation of lab  and identification by 16s rdna analysis showed that strains belonging to lactobacillus casei group were the most frequently isolated. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus parabuchneri,  and lactobacillus buchneri species were detected with lower frequency. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) applied to dna extracted directly from cheese samples and sequencing of rdna amplicons confirmed the complex microbiological pattern of lab in ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus fermentum species, which dominated in several samples, but was not detected by cultivation. the present combination of different approaches can effectively describe the lactic acid bacteria population of parmigiano reggiano cheese in advanced stages of ripening, giving useful information for elucidating the role of lab in determining the final cheese quality.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == effect of milk fermented with a lactobacillus helveticus r389(+) proteolytic strain on the immune system and on the growth of 4t1 breast cancer cells in mice.
AB  == previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration of lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus casei inhibits the development of fibrosarcoma and colon carcinoma, respectively. the aim of this work was to study the beneficial effects of the consumption of milk fermented by l. helveticus on a murine model for mammary carcinoma. female balb/c mice were challenged by a single subcutaneous injection of tumoral cells (american type culture collection  4t1) in the left mammary gland. prior to tumour injection, mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days with fermented milk. the following factors were monitored for 2 months: rate of tumour development, histological studies, apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal macrophages, determination of beta-glucuronidase enzyme in peritoneal macrophages, determination of gamma-interferon (infgamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in blood serum, determination of cd4+, cd8+, interleukin-6 (il-6), il-10, tnf-alpha and infgamma by immunoperoxidase, and measurement of beta-glucuronidase activity in intestinal fluid. the administration of l. helveticus delayed the development of  the tumour in all cases, a 2- or 7-day feeding period being most effective. this  work demonstrates that milk fermented with l. helveticus decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours. the effect was mediated by increased apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular il-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.

TI  == induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen a.
AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == role of intestinal epithelial cells in immune effects mediated by gram-positive probiotic bacteria: involvement of toll-like receptors.
AB  == the mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria exert their effects on the immune system are not completely understood, but the epithelium may be a crucial player  in the orchestration of the effects induced. in a previous work, we observed that some orally administered strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased the number of immunoglobulin a (iga)-producing cells in the small intestine without a concomitant increase in the cd4(+) t-cell population, indicating that some lab strains induce clonal expansion only of b cells triggered to produce iga. the present work aimed to study the cytokines induced by the interaction of probiotic lab with murine intestinal epithelial cells (iec) in healthy animals. we focused  our investigation mainly on the secretion of interleukin 6 (il-6) necessary for the clonal expansion of b cells previously observed with probiotic bacteria. the  role of toll-like receptors (tlrs) in such interaction was also addressed. the cytokines released by primary cultures of iec in animals fed with lactobacillus casei crl 431 or lactobacillus helveticus r389 were determined. cytokines were also determined in the supernatants of primary cultures of iec of unfed animals challenged with different concentrations of viable or nonviable lactobacilli and  escherichia coli, previously blocked or not with anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4. we concluded that the small intestine is the place where a major distinction would occur between probiotic lab and pathogens. this distinction comprises the type of cytokines released and the magnitude of the response, cutting across the line that separates il-6 necessary for b-cell differentiation, which was the case with probiotic lactobacilli, from inflammatory levels of il-6 for pathogens.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == a total of 21 strains of lactobacillus species were isolated from turkish kefir samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic activities including probiotic properties. as a result of the identification tests, 21 lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. acidophilus (4%), l. helveticus (9%), l. brevis (9%), l. bulgaricus (14%), l. plantarum (14%), l. casei (19%) and l. lactis (28%). the amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic activity, and acetaldehyde productions of lactobacillus spp. were determined. different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/ml. all strains produced hydrogen peroxide. l. bulgaricus z14l strain showed no proteolytic activity, l. casei z6l strain produced the maximum amount (0.16 mg/ml) of proteolytic activity. acetaldehyde concentration produced in lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/ml.

TI  == accumulation of short n-chain ethyl esters by esterases of lactic acid bacteria under conditions simulating ripening parmesan cheese.
AB  == esta from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 (lbh-esta), estb, and estc from lactobacillus casei lila, and esta from lactococcus lactis mg1363 (lcl-esta) were evaluated for their ability to accumulate esters in a model system simulating parmesan cheese ripening conditions (10 degrees c, 2 to 3% nacl, ph 5.4 to 5.5, aw = 0.850 to 0.925) using capalase k from kid goat as a positive control. all of the lab esterases and capalase k mediated the accumulation of esters in the model system in an enzyme specific manner, which was influenced by a, and selectivity for fatty acid chain-length. in general, enzyme mediated accumulation of ethyl esters was higher at aw values of 0.850 and 0.900 than at aw of 0.925, demonstrating that aw is a critical parameter influencing ester accumulation. the substrate selectivity of esterases, aw, and enzyme type may be important factors  in the development of fruity flavors, as evidenced by results in this model system simulating parmesan cheese ripening conditions.

TI  == nucleotide sequencing, purification, and biochemical properties of an arylesterase from lactobacillus casei lila.
AB  == an esterase gene, designated estb, was isolated from a genomic library of lactobacillus casei lila. nucleotide sequencing of the estb gene revealed a 954-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 35.7 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of estb contained the characteristic gxsxg active-site serine motifidentified in most lipases and esterases. an estb fusion protein containing  a c-terminal 6-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by affinity chromatography. the native molecular weight of estb was 216.5 +/- 2.5 kda, while the subunit molecular weight was 36.7 +/- 1.0 kda. optimum ph, temperature, and nacl concentration for estb were determined to be ph 7.0,50 to 55 degrees c, and 15% nacl, respectively. estb had significant activity under conditions simulating those of ripening cheese (ph 5.1, 10 degrees c, and 4% nacl). kinetic constants (km and vmax) were determined for estb action on a variety of ethyl esters and ester compounds consisting of substituted phenyl alcohols and short n-chain fatty acids. for comparison purposes, esta from lb. helveticus cnrz32 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and its substrate selectivity determined in a similar fashion. different substrate selectivities were observed for estb and esta.

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

AB  == in an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (a)-->kefir made from kefir grains (b)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (c), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lactobacillus brevis. yeasts (10-17%) identified were kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida inconspicua and candida maris. in  the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. along the pathway a-->b-->c, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. k. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir c.

AB  == with four lactobacilli--l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (atcc 12315), l. casei (nrrl-b1445), l. delbrueckii (nrrl-b445), and l. heveticus (nrrl-b1937)--the characteristics of cell growth and production of lactate and amino acids were investigated. especially, the time-course variation in concentration of amino acids (classified into alanine, serine, aspartate, glutamate, aromatic amino acid, and histidine families) was estimated in detail, and the results were systematically compared. it was elucidated that l. delbrueckii (nrrl-b445) and l. helveticus (nrrl-b1937) had quite different characteristics in growth, lactic acid synthesis, and amino acid production. l. helveticus (nrrl-b1937) was superior in the production of amino acids as well as in cell growth, but showed very poor ability in lactic acid production. however, l. delbrueckii (nrrl-b445)  showed higher yield of lactic acid despite repressed cell growth, but suffered from severe amino acid deficiency in culture. by modulating the initial concentration of each strain in the mixed culture containing both l. delbrueckii  (nrrl-b445) and l. helveticus (nrrl-b1937), the lactic acid production (i.e., the amount of lactic acid produced and lactic acid yield to glucose consumed) was significantly improved, presumably via symbiotic interaction between the two strains.

TI  == tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolism by lactobacillus cheese flavor adjuncts.
AB  == bacterial metabolism of tyr and phe has been associated with the formation of aromatic compounds that impart barny-utensil and floral off-flavors in cheese. in an effort to identify possible mechanisms for the origin of these compounds in cheddar cheese, we investigated tyr and phe catabolism by lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus helveticus cheese flavor adjuncts under simulated cheddar cheese-ripening (ph 5.2, 4% nacl, 15 degrees c, no sugar) conditions. enzyme assays of cell-free extracts indicated that l. casei strains catabolize tyr and phe by successive, constitutively expressed transamination and dehydrogenation reactions. similar results were obtained with l. helveticus strains, except that  the dehydrogenase enzymes were induced during incubation under cheese-ripening conditions. micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography of supernatants from l. casei and l. helveticus strains incubated under simulated cheese-ripening conditions confirmed that tyr and phe transamination and dehydrogenation pathways were active in both species and also showed these reactions were reversible. major products of tyr catabolism were phydroxy phenyl lactic acid and p-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, while phe degradation gave rise to phenyl lactic acid, phenyl acetic acid, and benzoic acid. however, some of these products were likely formed by nonenzymatic processes, since spontaneous chemical degradation of the tyr intermediate p-hydroxy phenyl pyruvic acid produced p-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, p-hydroxy phenyl propionic acid, and p-hydroxy benzaldehyde, while chemical degradation of the phe intermediate phenyl pyruvic acid gave rise to phenyl acetic acid, benzoic acid, phenethanol, phenyl propionic acid, and benzaldehyde.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and l. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to  these groups was first obtained by pcr amplifications by using group-specific or  species-specific 16s rdna primers. the numerical analysis of the ardra patterns obtained by using cfoi, hinfi, tru9i, and scrfi was an efficient typing tool for  identification of species of the l. acidophilus and l. casei complex. ardra by using cfoi was a reliable method for differentiation of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. finally, strains atcc 393 and atcc 15820 exhibited unique ardra patterns with cfoi and tru9i restriction enzymes as  compared with the other strains of l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == 16s-23s and 23s-5s intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable.  the aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions  could be of value in the identification of lactobacillus species. for that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to amplify 16s-23s and 23s-5s spacer regions of lactobacillus (l.) acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. helveticus and l. curvatus. the pcr products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal rna (rrn) operons were identified  in each species studied: one with tandem trna(ile)/trna(ala) genes and the other  one without trna genes. our study revealed that the rrn operons of lactobacillus  species studied comprise the genes of 16s, 23s and 5s rrna, in that order. only the trna genes and the rrna processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. the divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. these sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. theoretical rna/rna secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. in conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16s and 23s rdna sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as l. curvatus and l. casei or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus.

AB  == a plasmid, designated psuw100, encoding the d(-)lactate dehydrogenase [d(-)-ldh;  nad+ oxidoreductase, ec 1.1.1.28] from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 was identified from a genomic library by complementation of escherichia coli fmj39. the d(-)ldh gene was localized by tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning to a 1.4-kb region of psuw100. a 2-kb drai fragment of psuw100 encoding d(-)ldh activity was  subcloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. analysis of this sequence identified a putative 1,014-bp d(-)ldh open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 337 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 38 kda. the distribution of homology to the cnrz32 d(-)ldh gene in several lactic acid bacteria was determined by southern hybridization using an internal fragment of the d(-)ldh gene as a probe. hybridization was detected in leuconostocs and pediococci but not in lactococci or lactobacillus casei. an integration plasmid was constructed from psa3 and a 0.60-kb internal fragment of the d(-)ldh gene. this plasmid was used to construct a d(-)ldh-negative derivative of l. helveticus cnrz 32 by gene disruption; this derivative was determined as producing only l(+)lactic acid. no significant difference in growth or total lactic acid production was observed between cnrz32 and its d(-)ldh mutant.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial compounds from lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus casei and one of lactobacillus helveticus were examined for antagonistic activity toward twenty five indicator strains of different species. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acid and hydrogen peroxide, culture supernatants of all the lactobacillus strains exhibited a wide spectrum of inhibitory activity toward microorganisms of different genera. the inhibitory compound secreted by one strain of l. casei was  active against clostridium tyrobutyricum. the active components were insensitive  to proteolytic enzyme and heat treatment.

TI  == m13 dna fingerprinting, a new tool for classification and identification of lactobacillus spp.
AB  == the optimal conditions for the application of m13 dna fingerprinting to the genus lactobacillus were determined. comparative fingerprint analysis of representative strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. casei permitted the differentiation of species, subspecies and individual strains and the quantitative determination of their genetic relatedness. the results confirm  the high specificity of m13 dna fingerprinting and indicate that it might be used in the classification of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == isolation and characterization of is1165, an insertion sequence of leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned and characterized an insertion sequence from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strain db1165. this element, designated is1165, is  1553 bp, has imperfect inverted repeat ends, contains an open reading frame of 1236 bp, and is not related to any previously described insertion sequence. the copy number of is1165 varies from 4 to 13 in l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strains allowing genetic fingerprinting of strains based on location and number of bands on hybridization. is1165 or closely related elements have been detected  by hybridization in l. lactis, l. oenos, pediococcus sp., lactobacillus helveticus, and lb. casei but not in lactococcus.

TI  == fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii , l. lactis and l. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. the presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. l. casei and l. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while l. casei also produced diacetyl. l. casei and l. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. l. helveticus and l. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate  under the conditions used.

TI  == [bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  == lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into  bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.

TI  == multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  == genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. helveticus, and l. acidophilus. after treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids.  successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to  isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at  least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. furthermore, the  growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. these findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == some factors influencing carbon dioxide production by leuconostoc citrovorum.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine whether leuconostoc citrovorum plays a role in carbon dioxide production in milk. the ability of l. citrovorum strains to produce gas was studied by two methods. a qualitative method, in which an agar plug was forced up the neck of a volumetric flask, measured gas visually. this method demonstrated that 0.25% yeast extract, in a milk medium at 30 c, stimulated the production of at least 10 ml of gas. studies using a gilson differential respirometer revealed that l. citrovorum produced 500 to 900 muliters of co(2) in 6.5 hr, whereas 800 to 1,500 muliters of co(2) was produced  in nonfat milk which contained 0.33% yeast extract. cell extracts of streptococcus cremoris, s. lactis, lactobacillus lactis, l. casei, and l. helveticus also enhanced gas production of l. citrovorum from 20 to 70%. autolysates of these bacteria, present during the ripening or ageing of certain cheeses, may stimulate l. citrovorum, a common organism in starter cultures, to produce gas, causing, for example, the slit-open defect of cheddar cheese. yeast  extract caused an increase in acid and gas production per cell but did not cause  an increase in growth. experiments indicated that one metabolic source of carbon  dioxide was the decarboxylation of pyruvate produced during catabolism of citric  acid. yeast extract stimulated this reaction by 16%.
